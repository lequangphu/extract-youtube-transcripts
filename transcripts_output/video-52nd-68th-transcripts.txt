so I put out a joke tweet about how you need $20 million to retire and a non-trivial amount of people responded to that and they go yeah I agree with you and that's just completely ins sight isn't it bananas I think a little bit of crypto is escapism to people it's this is this is my lottery ticket to financial success but that is a very dangerous mindset because you're going to do risky things to get to that number that you think you really need the lesson there is if you if you target a certain p&l and trade to make a certain amount of money you're going to lose trade what the market gives you so you have to take what the market gives you keep your eye on the ball and not be so afraid of losses that that's what you focus on it's really it really involves a lot of [Music] discipline all right welcome back to another episode of thousand X we are filming this at the top of the market at 42k it is the top for many reasons but one of them is my engagement on my tweets this week it's just been ridiculous Jonah I tweeted like most of my tweets are kind of tongue and cheek I mean I I really hope nobody takes them as gospel or or very very seriously I kind of just try to have fun on Twitter you know my real thoughts are here every now and then I'll post real thoughts to Twitter but sometimes I just like watching what people do with you know statements and so I tweeted out I mean like it's true but like not you know it's true but I tweeted out uh dog coin like animal coins right now like dog wh hat cat wh hat did the story B they're like I wish uh I I I wish I wish my mom could see me now I mean ironically she can uh I I'll send her the link but I tweeted out that it's like being in a casino where the slot machine is 55% to win you just abuse that button until it stops working uh or until you get kicked out of the casino I tweeted that basically at what I thought would be the dog [Laughter] top you know you know what's crazy about this market like everybody's a [ __ ] genius now everybody knew that salana was going to rip to the 70s everybody knew that Wi-Fi hat. Sonic the Hedgehog was GNA [ __ ] make them Rich right and when I can can you can you like put some respect on the name sorry dog whiff hat dog whff hat no whiff dog whiff hat there's hat dog whiff hat it's whiff a hat you know yeah you don't have a hat I don't have a hat actually I do have a hat got a hat I guess people are watching on Spotify can't see this but cover that's a good hat I got yeah it's a it's a great hat I got it um there's this restaurant at the top of a mountain in Puerto Rico called aventur 4x4 you can only get there if you have a 4x4 the name speaks for itself do you have a 4x4 is the is the million dooll question I of course I have a 4x4 are you kidding I dri I drive I drive a Ford Bronco SAS wild track package why why would I drive anything differently I mean that thing is a beast comes with 32in stock tires it's stared I I don't want it to feel froy I want this to be a nice sustainable rally that gets us all rich for another 4X or 5x but man it is this is this is frothy to me there's no way this continues Jonah I mean there's no way this is I'm calling it I'm calling it now you know one of the top signals is when you're sitting here with your buddies and you're giggling about the names of the coins that have just 100 xed in a week not not not not 2x not 5x not 10x not 50x you're giggling at the name of a coin that is 100x in a week there was a thousand x uh I think it was the dog whiff hat one that one thousand xed oh did it th I mean I know like it had to a thousand X because it came out small but I think if did did how long did it take the Thousand X I thought it's been around for like 10 days or something like that I don't know yeah I mean at this point you know if you're if you're trying to pay attention to crypto crypto and you have been asleep or just uninterested during the whole bear cycle and now you're kind of waking up and getting back in you're looking at crypto Twitter and you're like oh wow Jupiter's going to do an airdrop oh wow I should be you know buying a saga phone to try and get some some airdrop tokens oh wow all these people who claim to be rich are uh talking about all this airdrop money that just landed in their account that they're not liquidating like I think in the absence of an actual use case this just feels like frost to me and like sorry not an actual use case a new use case something that some some tech unlock that's occurred in in cryp crypto and to me it's it's getting frothy I'm nervous here here's my bare argument jna this is this is my this is my you know as as as they say dumb bear argument well what drove this rally it was speculation on the ETF all right so now I'm pulling up data on the CME and what you can see is that from on October 11th there was 1.89 billion in open interest on the CME we actually had a peak of open interest on December 7th we got to 5.11 and now we're down to 4.71 we've hit a plateau of Trad five front running the ETF so I think the people that are ready to buy on the news are basically just the algo Traders and the actual inflows but you have at least three billion just looking at CME I don't you let's discount it by half let's say 1.5 billion is front running flows all from trafi that are looking to exit on the launch of an ETF okay so now you have 1.5 billion of selling that's probably going to happen in the course of a week if not sooner and then you have a bunch of people outside that that are looking at this and going well I'm going to sell once they start selling um and you're actually already seeing it I mean the open interest is down 400 million on the CME over the last last 10 days you have a ridiculous amount of froth in the market you know Bitcoin has G has gone sideways for the first time consolidating for the first time since 25k really um yeah and you have you know funding rates are not crazy elevated but they're elevated those CME Futures you're talking about like you can clip 15 to 20% annualize percentage yield uh no problem in this market it's pretty crazy to me that just shows you that there's there's not enough crypto native shops out there to do spot versus Futures I think you you just you have to start getting on the sidelines now if you're not on the sidelines you're going to be in you're going to be in some I I think you could be in for some pain I think a very easy way to get back in is just to start buying above 44 if if you're wrong I I'm not doing anything right now I'm just holding on to my core Longs I did not participate in a lot of this CR like I almost I almost clicked on bump I really liked bnk I didn't though and if if I had and if I were holding a bunch of [ __ ] dog coins or frog coins or Bitcoin ordinals uh that are like BRC versions of erc20 tokens like I would be selling those but I I'm not that kind of Trader I think I think it's I think it's tough to buy those with any with any real size anyway you can make 100K you can make a mill you can't put five mil into these things turn into 50 um I guess bunk you you kind of could but anyway that's Bes that's besides the point um it's not though sadly uh it's not and I didn't I didn't do it but I mean now now is there there are people out there that have very sophisticated models for tracking these meme CLS okay you have to understand that um I'm only you know I I am I'm not kidding uh there there there are people that scan the me pool for for new for new contracts see if liquidity is locked uh and whatever in whatever pools pools are published compare against the database of all of the you know contracts they that they know to be rugs compare against a bunch of phrases that they know to be that they know to be rugs and then immediately immediately snipe if it if it looks good um you know you can ingest Reddit data you can ingest Twitter data to to basically track the activity of these coins there's there's sophisticated operations out there that are pumping these things um and then every now and then you get a coin that breaks over into the mainstream like Tech Bros Silicon Valley Bros for some reason um they really like dog with hat like I saw a few people tweeting about it they're like this is really funny which I guess you know makes sense their sense of humor isn't great so why is it always a dog can you you're a crypto native why no no they're cat they're cats now too I think you know it's cat cat yeah but the big ones are always dogs listen Avi like here's what's amazing to me about crypto when I was professionally you know trading crypto every day you know I would interview a lot of candidates for crypto jobs uh crypto trading jobs and you talk to these people some of them are absolutely brilliant and they've been doing some pretty Advanced sort of systematic trading type research from their dorm rooms or you know just wherever the heck they were hiding out and you know they'd have a day job then they'd spend all night doing the sort of like mempool scanning type systematic analysis of meme coins that you talked about uh back in you know two years ago it was like people just building me Bots and side projects that were like generating sustainable income for these kids I I was blown away when I was going into crypto from Commodities I'm like this Market is Frontier everybody's going to be absolutely idiotic like there's not going to be much systematic stuff going on and in reality like when I got there I was blown away by the sophistication of some of these young Tech nerds who are building you know systematic and quantitative strategies to trade crypto it was actually competitive and meanwhile you look at the institutional side of things in assets like Commodities or frankly CME Futures in Bitcoin you know you can clip an easy 15 to 20% just buying spot versus selling Futures and you know coming back to the Commodities market right now what I'm realizing is like there's a pretty loow hanging fruit here because no none of those kids care about jet fuel or or gasoline right they all want to trade frog coins so I think you know just to wrap up this thought what I'm realizing is like uh this you know two things thing number one if in crypto if you're going to day trade you've got to be sophisticated it's not a market for idiots anymore and hasn't been for a long time and thing number two uh if this world of futurized you know institutional grade products like CME Bitcoin Futures and literally anything related to Commodities has still has so much lwh hanging fruit I think what it tells you is that the Walled Garden of the CME and many of these other big exchanges just isn't inclusive enough um and maybe that that speaks to crypto's Mission of ort of democratizing Finance I think it's kind of unfair that you know only a few people can touch some of these Commodities and touch Bitcoin Futures otherwise there wouldn't be this yawning basis AR it's literally Arbitrage it's risk- free yeah I mean basically anybody that wants anybody that wants to touch it or anybody that can touch it right now they're trading other things they they're they're they they're in other places which I think that what that tells you is just how much froth you know how much perceived froth there is and how much ual fra there is because what what you have to do as a as a participant you have to you know where where should I put my cap you know what what is what is the best use for my capital and when you have something like a basis trade at 20 25% and there a lot of people voting with their feet and they're saying not good enough sorry I'm not I'm not going to close it I'm not bringing that to 20 that tells you the mindset that bring zero just by it tells you it tells you it tells you how allocated people are uh and yeah it it's just a it's it's a very it's it's a very disconcerting thing I mean um you know my my view Bitcoin always tends to Top by the way in December or January except for this January this January it just ripped yes this January but that was you know after a right like after after a really bad year I'm saying you know if if if you rally until the end of the year um I I do think that over the next two weeks people are going to take some time off liquidity is going to dry up uh everybody that's allocated for the ETF is probably already allocated for the ETF at this point uh if the ETF gets approved before January I don't think people are making new allocations to the ETF until after January that makes me think that black rock probably wants this thing to go live in January anyway um you know Fidelity probably wants this thing to go live so my my view here is my view here is pullback reset wash people out and then you start to Gig a rally because I've been thinking about this a lot recently what does a post ETF world look like it's very rare that you get the opportunity to launch an ETF like this with such a large consumer base it's so rare and so there are a lot of people that are fighting for it you have Fidelity fighting for it black Rock's fighting for it Vanguard right and so what you probably are going to get or you're going to get a lot of resources dedicated to winning the first month to winning the first two months because what's well known is that it's an 8020 rule with ETFs right even more really you know the biggest ETF will generally have you know 80 90% of the market shares as liquidity be gets liquidity and so winning quickly is so important to everybody on this product because it's going to be a money driver for them they're probably going to Market very hard in the beginning they're going to be very very in because if they don't then they run the risk of losing and they run the risk of their product just never taking off ever so my view is that you're just cautious until you get a selloff and then whatever sell off you get Bitcoins at 37k maybe 38 you start chipping in at 40 you know like 39 you get to 35 any you know every every step down you just want to be loading the boat on your cycle bags and then post ETF we should we should run pretty hard because I think you know maybe maybe we pop it into the ETF and then come off but I think inflows are actually going to come in um you know I'm going to put my reputation on the line risk it all and say and say that you know there they're going to be some pretty substantial inflows more more than more than we expect I just think that um I think when we talk about those inflows you know I hope that people out there go and listen to the previous episode of the THX podcast how much crypto should you own I mean I saw something uh recently in the news saying that million Americans own own crypto um that's pretty pathetic percentage of Americans owning crypto I think a lot of people are going to go look at what 2023 was like in markets and they're going to say wow um you know the S&P did well uh but Bitcoin wow what is this you know best performing asset on the board by in order of magnitude maybe I should have one or two% of my portfolio in that just in case oh and there's the super easy way to to do it and I I see a black rock commercial three times every football game like you know maybe maybe I should buy some so ultimately I think you're right I think I think the ETF will you know we've been saying this on this podcast for a long time it's going to debottleneck a lot of uh a lot of interest in Bitcoin that can finally flow in I don't think there's enough Capital sloshing around in in the little crypto space right now to to front run that so I do think it'll cause a run I just I'm just worried about the volatility of all this because you know there is other than this ETF there is nothing Society is not using crypto in new ways I think it will soon maybe even next year but until that happens like we're not like it kind it kind of is I mean salana is really really picking up on the on the uh it's picking up on a narrative right like it's not picking up on you know a bunch of merchants all over the country adopting it for payment I think I think that I think that comes with time um I also know that uh you know what you're probably going to see in 20 in the beginning of 2024 is a a lot of new applications are very likely to come out um just because I know go Goldman's talked about uh you know launching we've talked about this on previous podcast but there are a lot of people that are talking about launching tokenized products right now and I think that's that's going to be a driver they're probably going to use uh public infrastructure they're probably not going to use their own internal infrastructure for now or at least a for for for public infrastructure yeah and so you know I think I think I think that's coming and also just the user experience of salana has gotten so much better swapping tokens navigating you know storing storing your wealth it's it's it's coming it's coming and and I think because it's actually quite nice and easy to use you know Merchant acceptance is is is also is also probably likely coming soon do you have a saga phone AI I don't I don't did you did you did you pick one up no man I'm married I don't need to impress anybody with this crypto [ __ ] I'm I'm good got an iPhone but like an iPhone Mini actually check it out it's tiny really light the mini yeah but okay but yeah yeah I mean at this point like I I guess I'm kind of wondering like do we need a new use case spreading its tentacles into traditional worlds in order to sustain a crypto rally because no no I mean I mean all all we need for Bitcoin what like here let me let me let me pose a question to you let's say in mid 2025 federal funds rate is one yeah bitcoin's up or down look you don't need to pitch me on being bullish Bitcoin I'm I'm literally so bullish Bitcoin I can't see straight however watching what eth did during the course of this huge rally and how [ __ ] spectacularly it underperformed has made me wonder like hey could we end up in a world where Bitcoin just gases higher because it has a true use case and a lot of these other things it's like yeah that's that's a fair point on ethereum I think ethereum is really in a really tough spot right now um I think that it will get a rally just out of because I think the narrative again will be the EF that comes out and that will happen and you basically probably want to buy ebtc for a month or two months post that but it I think they're just such a bad position because all these meme coins popping off on salana have made people realize they have made people go to other chains and it's made people realize just how much better the user experiences on basically every other train that exists including all the l2s on on ethereum and so I just think the the propensity to launch products the types of people that are going to go over and build on ethereum it's I think the the world is a lot less ideological on cry it you know the crypto world is just so much less ideological I think it's a very crypto native take I mean I I think going back to the 8020 rule you mentioned earlier um I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying like Okay so if if the big if the ETFs that Garner most of the attention in the beginning wind up dominating why wouldn't it be that the chains that have garnered most of the attention in the beginning of crypto gain long-term adoption over the long run like yeah sure using salana is great I'm sure a lot of I'm sure salana will be thriving for years but like ethereum might too the nft ecosystem is built entirely on top of ethereum Base the L2 you know like there's tons of money getting pupped into that that's on top of ethereum ethereum is like the security layer for information decentralized information just because it's getting left behind right now by one particular narrative which is meme coins and degeneracy on salana like just because that's going on right now doesn't necessarily mean that it's like the new state of crypto you know I I I I just think that AR that argument's tough when you're just not seeing a ton of innovation happening on eth on eth right now and that fund if that's true you're maybe you're right I just thought you are fun fundamentally they've fundamentally introducing l2s weakens the value proposition for Theory um Because unless unless they really really really really really explode in the short term the you know without l2s eth would have seen a much higher burn uh with with l2s it's just going to see it's just going to see a lower bur burn and so basically what ends up happening is that it's a long path for transaction counts and user activity to catch up with throughput through throughput has been jumping and then it's like a slow grind for transactions to catch up it's not an instant fill and so because it's not an instant fill what you do is you just drive fees lower and lower and lower and lower and lower um and and a big part of the ethereum narrative is people go and they watch the burn and so that has just been taken out of so why should salana rally salana fees are tiny I think because salana is deeply underallocation relative to ethereum okay um you're making me want to sell eth BTC you're making me want to rotate a lot of my eth into just Bitcoin I mean looking at yeah I mean look F dude I'd short this thing the lows are .02 and that was the local lows and that was like the the depths of covid um and then prior to that prior to the sort of like 2017 cycle it was it was 0.02 and then yeah then that just man if I'm looking at eth right now what I see is I see a very easy structured short where you can short here stop out above point 0.056 and you're probably looking for uh 0.04 to 0.045 and that that seems like that seems like a really good trade it's trending lower too it's smooth yeah it's trending lower it's a Time based trade uh I would close it on the Bitcoin ETF announcement um you know so I mean I think I think it's a I think it's a good it's a reason it's a reasonably good trade I mean there's just not much interest right now in ethereum and I think it's going to be very hard to get that interest back until people are willing to you know look look at the look at the next look at the next Catalyst and people start filing for you know the the the ETF more more seriously here's a contrarian scenario for scenario for you let's say that eth is just like chopping around going sideways or doing a Litecoin like becoming something forgotten while Bitcoin is just ripping will anyone care if an e ETF launches while they want to buy into it like an an ETF isn't necessarily A bullish Catalyst it's it's a bullish Catalyst for something that people want but can't easily get I think it's a short I think it's a short-term bullish Catalyst okay you know the Futures ETF was a catastrophe for what it's worth I think the Futures ETF is just a bad product right yeah we agree yeah so I mean it's it's it's hard it's hard to it's hard to extrapolate from that I mean I think the likelihood that the the the like the likelihood that eth you know radically under underperforms BTC over the next year is pretty substantial in my mind uh at this point I think you could you could probably see uh you know my my best guest is that it bottoms around the ETF announcement you see a 30 to 40% rally against Bitcoin and then and then it starts to Peter out if we haven't seen increased activity on E okay okay realistically the mcoin media and the nft media on salana is very different than what happened in 2021 where it was just all copycats kind of moving over from eth and then there would be the rotation play then salana would pump and avax would pump and all these other things would pump avac hasn't avac is pumped but it hasn't seen the same organic trading community and and attention that salana has seen over the last even though is actually outperforms a lot um it just hasn't seen that organic community and so it's not about the price action it's about that organic community that kind of worries me because that was always eat smoke is they had such a strong Community behind it the memes would launch the nfts would launch they would attract you know uh when new retail would come in they were flipping they were flipping stuff on Unis swap now they're on radium so there's just been this huge cultural shift away and I think that moat is is you know that that couldn't be understated for how important it was for ethereum and so now I look at Ethan I go man they've kind of just got the ETF what you could see happen because it always feels darkest You Know Before Dawn is the ETF Rec catalyzes everything and by the time eth is is up 30% we're like oh why did we ever hate eth I mean you know everybody's come back nobody's trading anywhere else again mem coins are popping off because eth is popping off um right and so that is you know that's a reasonable potential outcome but it you know that it has been degraded avac is a weird one I I I I do think that there's been a lack of me Mee like Meme coinery and there's been a lack of interesting projects on avac I think it just kind of Pumped because people Miss Salona I hate avac I always have I I don't I don't get it it doesn't make sense to me it's kind of like the third best solution for literally any of crypto's use cases at best or at worst is just useless and and here's what I I don't understand about avac um they went all in on gaming yeah um what what the [ __ ] is going on with that like it it feels like all the big games that are are gonna drop in crypto over the course of the next couple years are going to happen on other chains like I I hear a lot about eel 2s I've heard about a couple on salana where's this like they they made this big bet it where's the payoff at this point it's a very very very good question I think the answer is that um yeah they they they definitely they definitely made it bet there I think that they're pivoting a bit they're trying to be rwa chain now as far as I can see it of course they are as as as everything you know like OB obviously they're try they're trying to do that um you know I I I like the AAC team I think that they're you know I think that they're good I think that they're competent I think that it's just a very crowded area you know I think that the L the L1 space is just it's just very very very crowded and the reality is there just not that many product developers they're just not my that that many project developers um so you know I view I view avac madic you know all these all these other all these other l1s outside outside salana salana Neath is they're going to be good trades at some point you can always trade them right just look look for when they're look for when they're under allocated look for when they're shorted look for what's correlated uh to the to the main Runner look for where transaction counts are are trending up but yeah long term I'm just not super uh you know super super them on them me neither I mean I'm trying to think long term as well like I I agree you might get some volatility and if you're paying close attention you could probably clip a few nice trades out of it but I'm kind of you know in terms of long long term like two to five years I'm pretty much ready to give up on on avac on near and you know I I wouldn't give up on madic to me that's more of an L2 but like at this point I think I think you know the big alt l1s are are are probably not that necessary anym you have the monolithic solution which is salana you have the uh slightly more decentralized bit clunkier but possibly more secure solution called eth and you know I think eth will be the rwa chain frankly like uh why would avac be the rwa chain doesn't make any sense one reason specifically is for rwas they just need they need a lot more handholding right so if you want a lot more security too lot security handholding so if you if you can introduce subnets on avac then it's it's it'll be easier to onboard people from from an rwa perspective if you give them full control over that near is kind of a funny one they've they've sort of rebranded to AI uh and they've been you know they've been they've been they've been pumping off the pumping off that narrative because everybody everybody loves crypto xai yeah it's uh it's it's the new new new new big thing um I don't know Jonah I'm curious you know as a as as somebody that used to run trading over at Cumberland like what trading strategies because you you also you know your your programmer your developer like what what trading strategies would you be thinking about developing right now like what you know is is is there is there anything that you saw that worked last bull market or you know work work work when things are ripping yeah I mean uh basically I would try to bucket things into similar categories bucket tokens into similar categories and then just play the catchup so you know you could you could just basically take all of the l1s um and when a certain percentage of the market cap of your your basket has you know rallied a certain amount then you can just Place Long bets on on the rest of it you know that might have worked in uh you know avac and doing these huge rallies on basically nothing uh just following up on salana you know the the alt L1 category um you know compound a those two those two tend to trade in step with each other over the long run but not in the short run so you know we've talked about these sorts of strategies on the podcast before where you just play for mean reversion in the pair um in terms of like broader trading strategies uh basis like you know obviously if you're if you're retail and you're sitting at home maybe you can't even touch Futures but even if you can uh it's hard to really scale that trade but at the institutional level you know I don't know why there aren't 150 new companies coming in buying spot and selling Futures with institutional Capital can you lever up that trade easily yeah yeah you can um and it's it's just Arbitrage uh it's a little bit harder when B is negative because then you have to borrow coin to short but right now it's literally like you you buy the coin you sell the future and selling the future you know they make it easy for you that's that's what the CME is there for so you know there's that that's not a very systematic trade although there are you know there's some math and and more involved thinking and when and where to scale into it other than just like oh the basis is high I'm going to sell like you know you you you leg into it with uh with some discipline and some models and some system atic rigor what what what what what are the models like what are you looking for you're looking at historical intraday ranges intra week ranges intram month ranges and then you're you're sort of trying to say like hey if if we're at one of these you know Define define your extreme you know this this is where we've pre pre decided to add a certain amount of uh certain amount of dry powder and deploy it into bases and like I you know obviously I'm not allowed to disclose anything about drw's trading strategies but this is just how anyone should think about a risk-free cash and carry trade you know you you don't want to blow your entire wad when basis is widened out from 0% to 1% so you kind of want to think about hey how wide how wide range is this thing traded in in the past and maybe let me set some rules for myself maybe even back test them um the back test is going to look great obviously because it's risk-free arbit yeah so um you know that that's a trade that I'm surprised more institutions aren't doing right now you know one thing I always think about when I'm when I'm running these types of Trades is when you when you go on the short leg on CME or let's say you're short leg on binance or okx or or anywhere else where you're trading a future you're always going to be constrained by the fact that you you're always going to be constrained by the fact that you might get blown out on the leg that you have leverage with right so for example you know I have let's say I have uh I have $10 a BTC I post $5 do of collateral to go short that short that short that BTC or I use that BTC as collateral and I'm you know short short against it you can't you sometimes can do that depending on the exchange some sometimes you can't you you have to manage that leverage really effectively but if you uh if you have a no liquidation account like what Alam had in theory you can just print infinite money right because like because because there there there coins out there that I mean there are coins out there that would have 200 they literally did print infinite money they printed ftt yards and yards of it but like how like the losing money is should be a completely foreign C if if you have a no liquidation account in crypto losing money should be a foreign concept to you because all you do is you just buy the underlying scam asset like you know you short the future against it and sometimes you see blowouts of 100% right and then it'll come in and you'll make 100% a month you're like wow that was simple and easy wow collected some nice funding there yeah I mean a no liquidation Futures account it's amazing Obi just how much of trading boils down to having a lot of VAR and not getting stopped out like some of the air quotes best Traders I've ever met in my entire career and these are guys with hundreds of millions of dollars in their in their bank accounts or or in a couple of cases billions like they're not really doing anything that much more complicated than hanging on while everyone else can't right and and how did they get there you know maybe some political Savvy maybe they were actually doing something smart in the beginning of the career their careers and their investors back them uh with you know no stop out type type funding or maybe it's Sam bankman freed and his Alam crew of uh Misfit clowns for a little while until they they [ __ ] even even that up um you know I don't know man it's VAR is so important VAR is so important just so you know to anyone who's listening right now uh stay in the trade don't don't get thrown off the mechanical bull the one tweet that I sent out this week that kind of it made me laugh but it it was almost it was almost conc erning to see so I I think I'm going to write a tweet Thread about this just because of how how concerning it was to me so I put out a joke tweet about how you need $20 million to retire and a non-trivial amount of people responded to that and they go yeah I agree with you and that's just completely insane uh isn't it bananas in my you know you don't it's really about your lifestyle and there are so many people that live happy good successful productive lives never making more than you know 100k year never making more than even like 75k a year um and that's you know I I I think I think a little bit of crypto is escapism to people it's this is this is my lottery ticket to financial success but that is a very dangerous mindset because if if you sit there like let's say you have 250k and you sit there and you go I need 20 million I need 20 million that you're going to make bad decisions you're just naturally going to make very bad decis decisions because you're going to do risky things to get to that number that you think you really need what you should really I think people just have to really understand look it's not at the end of the day it's not about the money um not to get philosophical but I've I've made many decisions in my life uh that optimized away for money actually uh you know optimized for learning optimized for happiness optimized for health uh and I'm you know if if I had three times as much money as it did right now if I had chose different path I don't think I would be happier that's a really important thing to mention and also just taking it back to market theory for a second you know pretty much the seminal book of finance that most people read you know I guess you could say there are a few there's liars poker by Michael Lewis but you know one of one of the big ones is reminisces of a stock operator everybody reads that book and uh you know is written by a stock Trader back you know hundred years ago on on the whatever the the stock trading pit or floor in New York was was called back then I forget anyway he he shares this anecdote where he says you know I saw this really nice fur coat and I wanted it and I looked at the price and I said okay I'm going to go to work the next day and put on trades that'll make me enough money to buy this coat and then what happens is just a series of of you know just one horrendous trade after another and he loses pretty much all of his money and the lesson there is if you if you target a certain p&l and trade to make a certain amount of money like if you're trading to make a coat or buy something a house an island whatever it is that you think you need a lifestyle you're going to lose trade what the market gives you don't don't trade like some aspirational like uh capitalistic outcome in your personal life and equally what I would add sort of a corollary to that theorem that somebody taught me earlier in my career and has has made me a much better Trader as a result of it is if you trade to not lose money you just lose money so much like you can't focus on trying to make a certain amount of money to buy something with your day-to-day trades you focus on the market not on on what you want to buy equally you can't be so scared of losing money that you focus on trading to avoid losses like you're you're trading to make money not to lose money so you have to take what the market gives you keep your eye on the ball and not be so afraid of losses that that's what you focus on you it's really it really involves a lot of discipline and I think I think once once a month in this market there's there comes a trade where you look at at and you go this is so obvious and then you take it and you size you size it correctly you you never want to you never want to size it where you can where you can blow yourself up and the reality is that a lot of people want those quick hits they want those quick wins because they see everybody else getting them and sometimes you can right sometimes you find a dog with hat and you put in $1,000 and it turns into 200,000 but those opportunities don't come along very often you can't force those opportunities a lot of people see that and they go I really want to find the next one sometimes there is no next one yeah and if you'd go try to 100x your your your 200k that you just made on dog whiff hat uh on the next thing you'll probably fail right like like you said you can't you can't make money out of thin air so I guess one other thing Warren Buffett had this great quote he said um most people want to get rich quick uh and people just can't get their heads around getting rich slow it's really right right like you uh you know you kind of have to you kind of have to be comfortable like making incremental gains sometimes if there's not a huge swing to take uh and you can't always just get rich quick but you know to your point about what it takes to live and you know to retire if your goal is to trade crypto until you can have you know 20 3040 million and then retire with you know1 to2 million a year of expenses living L Dolce Vita in like New York or Paris or something like yeah maybe that's how much it takes but like I I I don't think crypto should be anybody's ticket to that or certainly not anybody who's trying to actually get it right as opposed to you know people who are just playing the lottery yeah I I I also think that you you just need to understand what actually makes you happy right does what what what makes you happy is it is it playing is it playing the game is it winning the game is it is it the money is it what it affords you and then at a certain point just recognize that everybody's on a hedonistic treadmill but it's actually quite easy to step off you just have to have perspective on it um right so you know I know I know for myself for example I could keep going until I can buy 747 do I want to I mean honestly no I'd rather wake up in the morning you know 747s are pretty cheap now I saw one at Burning Man and how how how much do I go for 787 that's what that's what you want the Dreamliner yeah exactly it's such a nice plan Cathedral Windows you know that they person but anyway what I was gonna you know I was gonna say something really profound Jon until you cut me off sorry keep going 900 million private Boeing 787 Dreamliner um yeah that's may maybe maybe too expensive but I was going to say is you know I prefer to I prefer to have my health I prefer to have my happiness because I I I think that you know some some levels of success they require sacrifice I mean you know that level of success requires a tremendous amount of sacrifice you basically need to make your life entirely about your work uh you need to be obsessively focused and these are all admirable qualities but they come with drawbacks and I think you need you need to get older you need to be around these people you know which I have been and that teaches you a lot about what you want what what you want your life to look like and what you can what you can be happy with there are people out there that can be happy with 5 million there people out there that can be happy with one there people out there that won't be happy with 20 um you have to make sure it's really you it's not you know what your Society is telling you or what people around you are telling you or you know what you were you know what what what your original what your original dream was versus versus what reality versus what reality is and so I guess you know I I see this I see this over over and over and over and over um there are people out there that spend like 14 hours a day in front of their computer like digging for things digging for things in crypto at the expense of their health at the expense of their relationships at the expense of their life and I don't necessarily think that's a great wonderful trade-off it can be um you know if that's really really really really what you want um but I think it's you know it's worth it's worthwhile having that perspective that it doesn't it doesn't have to be that way and by the way I also think you can be successful in crypto working like like if you do this like three to four hours a day but you just actually Focus like you you just you just do what you need to do instead of spending like eight hours talking to people on telegram about like nonsense or or you uh you build a process yeah you build a process I mean like like I I think I think you can be ridiculously successful with the right with the right with the right alerts with the right watch lists with the right analytics tools you probably can spend three to four hours a day on this and be in the top 1% of Traders I genuinely think that I I agree I mean I think ultimately if your passion is trading crypto because you're interested in the market and it gives you that little intellectual tingle then it's definitely worth spending a lot of time on if you're like well this is the amount of money I want to have it's more than I have now and crypto seems to be the thing that could go up the most so it's probably my ticket you know I wouldn't necessarily recommend aping a you know too much of your net worth into crypto other than maybe Bitcoin um just and just having it in the background I mean bitcoin's you know it depends on your size right bitcoin's probably not going to get you anywhere um if you really want to make it big like uh if you want to take yourself into a category maybe but like I I do think that in the next five years Bitcoin will five back from here probably not going to change that you know I think people you know let's say you have five grand right what are you gonna what are you gonna put your money in Pro probably going to put your money in uh you're probably just going to bet on a bull market and you're probably just going to put your money in things like you know the AI coins or uh Bitcoin beta or Oris better odds than double zero way way way better odds than double zero I mean that that's Beauty the beauty this this this crypto this crypto thing I take your point I take your point it's a really good by the way I really like that analogy um with the with the fur coat the story the story with the fur coat it's so true like anytime you have a goal in mind for your trading what it forces you to do is it forces you to create opportunities where there might not be because in your mind you're thinking you're thinking to yourself well I need I want to hit this target what is this that can help me get to this Target and the right answer might be there's nothing right now but when you're in the mindset of looking for what will get me to that Target you you find things right it's like when you you know humans look around and they see faces and things right so if you're a Trader you will find a trade if you're looking for a yes right like this what happens here's a little here's a little systematic pearl of wisdom like a nice rule of thumb to to follow so the one instance the one exception to the fur coat rule where you can actually Target a certain amount of pnl is when you have a back tested strategy right you can say like all right well this thing seems to consistently work over time let me dial up the risk to try and make X in a year and so here's the type of draw down this is the rule of thumb this here's the type of draw down you should expect if you're if you're doing that sort of trade that sort of systematic trading so let's say that you're trying to make $1 million in a year with your systematic strategy and it has a back tested sharp of 2.0 so your target p&l is 1 million uh you youve geared your risk until your target p&l is 1 million and your back tested sharp is 2.0 so if if your Shar if let's say your sharp continues to be two as you trade let's just say that that's that's the sharp of your systematic portfolio um the largest just sort the a one standard deviation Peak to trough draw down in your year to to come is going to be your target p&l divided by your sharp so in this case 1 million divided by 2.0 so you should expect some time over the year to draw down from whatever p&l number you're at down 500 gr that's like a one standard deviation p&l draw down and so I sort of think like if you're actually going to try to go for the fur coat um which you probably shouldn't do anyway you had better have rigorously back tested your trading process adhere to it and be super stone cold sober and mathematical about how much money you might see yourself losing at any at any given point during the year so again for a million you know to Target panl divided by sharp and to me that's like a really helpful way to kind of keep your head uh screwed on right when you're losing money and not do stupid [ __ ] wow what a what a sober and thoughtful note to end on Jonah what we we we started with the fro so OB we gota we got we got we got to reel it in um you know as as always it was a pleasure uh a a pleasure chatting you we we we went we went in some good circles this time yes we did so we'll uh we'll see you next time hopefully uh actually I guess um it's going to be New Year's so we might we might push it until the new year so this might be the last podcast for the new year but you know uh we'll we'll we'll see we'll see you guys soon and we'll keep uh we'll keep bothering everybody on Twitter keep pissing people off and if you're upset or angry or you're feeling kind of bummed out this holiday season just tweet some angry [ __ ] at Obi he takes it really well just troll him yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm better at handling trolls and Jonah yeah I can't take it I suck not none of this is investment advice it will never be investment advice I'm bad at investing um nobody should listen thank you same ditto love you guys see you next time Happy New [Music] Year

Transcript Text:
Jonah you you pissed off everyone again I did it I did it again I I literally set everyone's hair on [Music] fire on Twitter dude dude uh anom anom ratioed you so hard everybody ratios me man I just I put my thoughts out there I'm like hey this is what I think and people like [ __ ] you so on the one hand I'm you know I'm getting good engagement for the Thousand X podcast on the other hand I'm like Jesus people are ruthless out there dude people people just love to hate you this isn't a new thing Obi this precedes crypto but you know they they love to hate me so they keep me around the more that I I watch you interact on Twitter as I've seen your account grow it just it just gets better and better and [Music] better all right guys welcome back to another episode of THX we are at 42k on bitcoin which was everybody's price Target a month ago and so now that we're here what do you do well stay tuned we will not be answering that question for you because that is financial advice but you know I hopefully hopefully by the end of the conversation you'll know even less than what you knew at the beginning so should we should we jump into it yeah let's jump into it here's here's what happened with my tweet so uh I I was talking to some friends you know just just from outside the crypto world yes those people exist and I was talking about how crypto's sending and they're like huh isn't it debt I thought crypto was like 2021 and then it just kind of ended like what are you talking about like the the the price of Bitcoin just hit 40K it's going bananas and you know do you own any crypto no and you know it sort of brought me back to this institutional um kind of saying that a good percentage of your portfolio to hold holding crypto is 2% that's what like responsible financial advisers recommend to responsible clients who are looking to preserve wealth and take like a little bit of risk but if you go out on the street Ai and you ask 10 people do you own any crypto you know I think you're gonna get five to seven NOS you know so I was thinking hey let me just send out something like if you're not uncomfortable long F you know kind of targeted at those nocoiner people like if you're not if you're not like starting to to put you know a decent chunk of your portfolio into this meaning like 5 to 10% and you're just going to feel stupid again like you probably did the last two bull cycles in crypto um but then I obviously posted that in the wrong place I posted it on crypto Twitter yeah I was I was I was gonna say like that that was that was the main issue is your your audience just a bunch of degenerates so you know when when you when you post something like that I mean look I think if I had 10% % of my net worth in crypto I would feel horrendous because I did at one point and I felt horrendous and then I dove into it full time and I still felt horrendous because then it [ __ ] went to zero but like it's yeah it's it's not enough if you believe in this [ __ ] if you really believe in this stuff I mean yeah dude have have 80% of your net worth in crypto fine rip it um I mean I I have I have had I don't think at any point in my life I've ever had since I discovered crypto I've had less than 50% except for um in 2022 yeah I think I think that was that was that was basically it and even then you know I still had when I say crypto exposure I still had just a bunch of usdc think like at all moments of my life I've had more than 50% of my net worth in crypto on like crypto rails that's interesting I it just it's like everything's so much easier I mean like for example I'm going to Miami this weekend it's like I needed I needed to rent a rent a place and guess guess what I paid for it in usdc and the best part about it was the guy sent me sent me a wallet with a linked ens I won't dox it but uh it had Sheba in it and ape coin and I I almost felt like I should reach out to this guy and be like dude let me help you buy some buy you know subscribe on the thousand X podcast YouTube page buy some Harry Potter Obama Sonic Yu come on like you're you're in last year's you're in last year's [ __ ] coins I saw a new one it's it's it's spelled fro but it's it's probably pronounced like frog uh fro fro is accurate um dude there mem coins are meme coins are popping off I mean you have big time ripping Ori Ori is such a good ripfest because it's the Mee it's like the Bitcoin meme coin and so many things are happening on bitcoin right now and people are actually trying to build and Bitcoin nfts are popping off and meme coins on bitcoin are popping off I I really do think that you know people thought that that move was priced in I really don't think it's priced in I think if you spend the next two weeks of your life looking at three different areas I mean we've covered AI a lot and I'm still very bullish on AI um but I I think you you you cover you cover AI you cover things that are happening on bitcoin and then you just dive into nfts on both salana and ethereum you're going to have a really good time in the next six to six to 12 months because we're at the point of the cycle I think nfts on ethereum are going to are going to pop we're at we're at the point of the cycle Jonah where Bitcoin needs to fall apart for alt not to run like you need Bitcoin at 38k 10% you know Bitcoin at 35 the weeks after that if Bitcoin stabilizes is actually when alts tend to run the hardest so yeah you might get caught on a leverage draw down right if you're over levered if you're one of the Deens that got really mad at your Tweet because you were 300% levered and then you get taken out on a 10% move right you evate your portfolio but if you just survive and you find the right areas to allocate to right now I mean this is the freest money you're going to see in you know in a long time not Financial advice but I mean this is like like this Market Dynamic is th this is where you know you you 3x in a two weeks um I mean just and then you kind of look across the board uh Joanie you've always been ridiculously bullish I think I've been much more cautious bullish than you but inflows into ETP products are are picking up SEI semi Futures are still are still buying Crypton native Leverage is basically non-existent uh you have altcoin you have altcoins doing well but not crazy well so the froth you know I wouldn't point at the market and say there's immense froth I'd say that there's like you know it's like a poorly done cappuccino a little bit a little bit little bit of fraud I mean look I I've been bull I've been ridiculously bullish but I haven't been ridiculously bullish the things that have gone parabolic like I wasn't ridiculously bullish salana I wasn't ridiculously bullish you know Stacks or the pzy pudy we were post post Ani we got bullish post anat we got super bullish yeah um that is true but like I wasn't bullish at at eight or 10 or 15 back then I was like man salana is just reeling right now like is it even going to participate in this next upswing or is going to be like you know polka dot or near actually near just ripped everything's [ __ ] ripping but the point is like I was bullish the slow stuff and now I feel out of my element because like my old Trad five brain like I I can understand Bitcoin and eth and now I can understand salana because Anna toally held my hand through it but I just can't get my head around some of these altcoins and believe in them enough to like you know throw serious money at them you don't need to believe in them Jonah you just need to know the people are going to gamble on them I mean think about think about this argument for for AI for example nobody nobody knows how to Value anything related to AI nobody like nobody uh o Open AI valued at what 80 billion I mean 90 before they lost their CEO the thing could have maybe nobody knows how that was actually going to make real money at the at the end of the day they just believe that you have a technology powerful strong enough you have a dream big enough and you'll make you'll make a ton of money and crypto is the epitome of you have a dream big enough you make money so not only do you have real AI products in crypto like a Kos Network that are actually solving a problem the upper bound is I dare say it unlimited right like like the the and then combine that with the fact that it's the only way for your average person to bet on AI I mean there's Nvidia but I guess that's priced to the Moon dude a how how big is NVIDIA I think it's a trillion trillion one it's huge it's like a fourth or fifth biggest market cap thing yeah I'm not talking about um you know betting on AI derivatives there are a lot of ways to bet on AI derivatives but how do you bet on AI products you could buy Microsoft right but that's again like a derivative and you could be an accredited investor and and invest in like a you know Silicon Valley style startup fund what's what's a Pure Play I want to only invest in an AI product other than like cow akashh I mean live Pier I mean right I mean you have these things in crypto yeah near maybe to some extent although that's more of a derivative play um but unlike unlike the GameStop Reddit situation and yes GameStop is running again and the Reddit crowd is back like unlike that um these these tokens are actually attached to projects that could in theory deliver value one day um it's not just like a bunch of bunch of random dudes in their basements trying or their mom's basements like deciding to squeeze some hedge fund out of a short like these you know these these projects in crypto like they they could have utility I look I think wow that was such a good sign in hindsight for crypto I'm looking at the G gme chart it ripped from 12 to 17 and then Bitcoin broke up I mean I think I think B you know we were betting on bitcoin breaking up regardless you know what I like about this rally Obi is that I I feel kind of smart again I don't feel stupid anymore um I feel a bit Vindicated like I'm not you know obviously you know from the internet that that I'm not like I haven't just like five exed my net worth on this so not not much has changed but at the same time like I feel I feel Vindicated and I think a lot of people do and I think that you know you can see in the responses to this tweet that everybody pissed off like that pissed everybody off like suddenly everyone's got their their sort of their confidence back they got their Swagger back it is it we're not just like this rag tag group of people that get made fun of by our friends and relatives anymore like this this [ __ ] is sending and it shows no signs of slowing down because we still hav't de bottled neck the institutions who ultimately will be more interested at at these prices than they would if if we were just sort of like festering sideways on the lows or near the lows yeah I mean that to me makes me want to sell but you know I get it cuz the moment the mo the moment you you start you start to feel like okay I was right it's working it's easy um but I mean I I think I think the the you know that the S sort of me meing meing aside it it's a little hard to fight the Flows at this point I mean I don't know I I I think I I like gun in my head I don't know where Bitcoin is going to go it could range between 38 and 42 it could sell off down to 35 it could go to 48 I'm I'm I'm just not I'm not in the habit of selling Bitcoin uh and during par during dur during during parabolic advances until you get a crazy move like you get you get a nuts move and then what you do is you just barbell it into alts so then you hold some cash to buy stuff for the inevitable draw down and then you rotate to stuff that just hasn't really moved aggressively I'm waiting patiently but I have started buying the most hated coin in crypto which is ethereum people really hate it I can tell I love it but you know I I I I do think that the the mentality and the narrative around ethereum right now is just so so so downtrodden I mean eth Maxis are just they're just nowhere to be found uh everybody's rotated to to salano or you know you're buy you're buying Bitcoin just across the board everybody's Focus has shifted off of E but it almost it will seem obvious in hindsight when Once the Bitcoin ETF comes out or once bitcoin's priced in right maybe we trade 44 before the ETF and that's the price in and then this starts to happen is people are just going to talk about the eth ETF that's next and it's so and it by the way if the eth ETF allows for you to stake eth it becomes like this insane product yeah right where it's just it's it's it's an ETF that gives you upside to crypto that you're getting yield on dude this thing is going to go parabolic and I for some reason people aren't talking about and I'm probably early that's why I'm happy to you know I'll be buying over the next two weeks three weeks maybe month uh could could go sooner depending depending on price action but at some point that narrative shifts I think that some point is at some point in the next six weeks that narrative shifts and then eth is at 3K before you blink um and everybody that you know was trashing eth was on team BTC that was on team salana is gonna g gonna flip over and by the way I hold no ill will to people that flip like that I flip like that right you you you you buy you buy you buy a position you get you're like ah you know a lot of these people are like meing around right they don't you know a lot of these people don't actually believe it anyway but but in order one thing that I've seen is like in order in order to to hold a position for a 2X to 3x you sort of need to convince yourself that you do like it long term um like a lot of Salon bulls that I know like they would look me in the eye two months ago and they would say salana is the best thing that has ever been built ever I can't imagine owning another L1 I can't imagine eth ever doing well again Sal's and then salana 3x's and the good the good ones are looking at me and they're going I don't know really not that much on salana guys like you know and and I appreciate it right you because because because in order to hold for that 3x you got to convince yourself yeah you you do and you I mean salana is one of those coins that that you can actually believe in and and even on the lows however like I don't know I I built my trafi career by trading around my position like you don't have it's not black or white you don't have to be Allin or flat or short right like you you could love something and it could rip and you don't really see why it ripped so much and then you you don't you're like ah should I sell should I not sell it's not it shouldn't be a debate like you can peel off 10% of your position or 15% of your position and take a little bit of profit and if it keeps going you're still long and if it goes back down then you just buy it right back you know like it's it's a good way to generate some returns around things that that go up and down apparently crypto Twitter now thinks that crypto can only go up but you know the memories of the collapse are still fresh for a lot of us so you know if you're if you're undecided about your position you can always just tailor the size of it it's not it's no there's no shame in that you don't have to like if you're out you can tweet again you know you can tweet like I'm 1 15% all in and beat your chest all you want but like you know you could quietly do some smart stuff sell a little high buy a little back low and and keep going now I wouldn't be selling Bitcoin or eth right now uh you know salana I'm mulling peeling a little bit off my position because I just like you said you know it this was a narrative driven rally it [ __ ] 8X from the lows and there's still not a ton going on I believe in the promise of it but I'm debating like whether this is the right price to to remain as long as I am so you know maybe maybe time to take a little bit of profit and trade these things around like you said if people rotate into eth then maybe salana will come off a bit I don't know don't kill me Salon fans like ultimately though when you when you evaluate the reward you also have to think about the risk like the risk if if you're thinking if you're going for a 2xr on something and you're looking at eth and salana salana in the 60s and eth around 200000 your risk with salana is way [ __ ] higher right uh there's no doubt about that in the short run it's just a more volatile token like there are metrics of realized volatility and salana you know I haven't run it today or recently on salana but Sal invol is just through the roof eth is a lot more stable so your risk is lower if you if you go into eth at this point um I agree with what you're saying also you know I think that that some of the the ways that you know that people are emboldened right now besides just reading crypto Twitter nft prices like pudgy Penguins [ __ ] 10x you know this is this is what people do when they start to feel like they have a little bit of extra cash and they're ready to gamble you know I I agree with you and and and nfts are kind of interesting because the okay so just just some numbers the eth market cap is about nine times or I I think eight and a half times bigger than the salana fully diluted value but the eth nft market cap is about 20x as large as salana nft market cap and I think that the crossover between the people that are like likely to pour a lot of money into nfts and salana is much higher than the people that are likely to buy a bunch of nfts and and and own eth other than the eth you know Wales uh that I think are going to rotate some of their profits into deth nft I think a lot of the new money that's coming in so salana nfts just to recap what was I bullish on I was bullish on AI now bullish on Sal nfts which ones the Chads the the seagull mad Lads qu uh you know I I I you know I think I think that for a trade or for like a longterm no for like the next six to 12 month you just hold them and then when things are like when you wake up and the first thing you do is you refresh your portfolio and it's up 20% and it's the eighth day in a row that it's up 20% and you're dreaming of buying a private island that's when I that's when you sell that's like that that that that's my mentality for this market right now is that this is this rally is so powerful very strong reminds me a lot of 2020 2021 it just pattern matches kind of nicely that the the way that this ends is in a bang um you know and then what probably ends up happening is is is it probably looks a little bit like 2021 where it's it's more of a rounded top than a complete blowoff and then collapse um because I think that the the reason that you don't get those complete blow-offs anym more in a in a in a market like this is just because there are too many larger institutional guys that do move a little bit more slowly than there were in 2017 so that's when you get the more rounded tops like in 2021 where you you blow off you come down but then you come back up a bit and then sort of meander sideways so I think it took you know it B basic basically took a full month to top in in 2021 I think you'll see something you'll see something similar here I disagree I kind of disagree I think that I think that you would there's obviously a lot of buying going on right now people are emboldened there's you can't fight the flows that's what we always say on this podcast but right now you know there there aren't a lot of sellers um and I think the music is going to stop when the institutions finally have this Gateway via the ETF I think the ETF is going to bring in a ton of capital I think it's all going to go parabolic very quickly when that happens and I think you're you know in the absence of a major use case that's bringing in tens or hundreds of millions of actual you end users to use products that are built on top of crypto I don't think you're going to have this steady buying going on I think what you're you're going to see is another you know Casino style speculative frenzy like we've seen without any fundamental kind of sustenance to it any follow through so I think it's going to go parabolic and then I think at some point the price is going to be quite High the music's going to stop and then I think it's going to collapse back down kind of like spring 2021 style until it finds buyers again um I think in order for you to to like level I'm almost done sorry I'm just rambling but like I think for you to like level off at at Fresh highs you you need you need a use case and right now the only the only use case that major use case that crypto is serving is like this speculative mechanism except Bitcoin but that's I think I think we're talking past each other I'm not saying that it's going to level off there's definitely going to be a crash the question is how how how quickly does it does it all fall apart um you know in 2021 it fell apart in like a week okay like Bitcoin was down 70% like a week and like literally right it hit 20K and then it completely collapsed um I just think that it's going to be less violent uh mostly because I think the Run Up's less violent and the type of participant is less violent um you know less less less emotional still very emotional uh I do think that there's going to be tremendous amount of allocation post post ETF given the way that this Market has traded um and a lot of people are gonna you know one one thing that's kind of interesting about the ETF is it's going to make it's going to open Capital flows for Bitcoin because of the ability to borrow again you know in your brokerage portfolio margining for institutions it it'll get cheaper to buy Bitcoin B it's going to get so much cheaper to buy Bitcoin I mean right now like one of the one of the ways that people are buying Bitcoin why micro strategy always rips and why so here's here's here's actually an interesting thought is that the micro strategy premium to BTC once that really converges then you start to then then we're going to start to level off because sailor is incentivized to keep ramming as much Capital into the market as possible by selling these super overpriced con and buying and buying BTC and that trade gets a lot worse for him once the premium comes in um and so like basically as long as that premium remains High uh you can just go out there and sell you can you can sell expensive and buy and buy cheap and he's just going to keep doing that day day day after yeah another we little basis trade yeah until I mean but it's just for sale yeah no I get it I mean look like like I think the big narrative shift between this budding bull cycle and the previous budding bull cycle like you you know the the fiscal and monetary situations are about to become more accommodative again that's kind of the same in 2020 and 2023 24 right that that hasn't changed what's really changed is that unlike the previous cycle the infrastructure layer is really robust now like you the distributed computing decentralized trust like it's a really it it's like a robust well-built product this time whereas in the past it had the prospect of being a robust well-built product but people were still paying like 300 bucks in gas to to buy an nft right now now there's there's block space available like the infrastructure Works sana's worked through its Kinks bitcoin's established itself um and we're sort of like we're there the infrastructure works this time now like I I think we really you know I I think bitcoin's going above 100K in the next three years but I think in order for us to get there it's not just going to be an ETF like an ETF is not a use case you need you need somebody to use this infrastructure in a really brilliant way that just sucks in tons of tons of people tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people without realizing they're using it is it decentralized you know compute for these AI engines that are you know I have I I have chat GPT on my screen all day asking it questions like that compute is not free you know is it going to be decentral compute is it going to be helium Hive mapper any of the stuff we talked to toi about one of the all it's going to take is one of these things and then crypto is going to I think be very sustainable at a higher price I just I want to maintain sobriety around this ETF I think it's it's not a sell all of your bags on the news thing but it's like take some profit on the news when it when the institutions can come in that's what I I think yeah do do do you think a okay so here's here's the thing every everybody thinks that do they are you kidding me I don't know I pissed off like a million people on Twitter by you know the whole world thinks that the E you know sell the news okay for for for for the ETF so the question is my my gut feeling around this is that it either rips for like a month like you it either rips for two weeks to a month after and then falls apart completely once people are convinced of the new paradigm or it takes people out before right so we top in the next two weeks and then ETF gets approved on the 11th but by then it's it's too late momentum has shifted um I don't know I I put probability of both at 5050 I put probability that it tops on the day of the ETF okay I I'd say my probably distribution is like 40% it dies early 40% it rips it rips after 20% it dies dies on the day um to make that a more useful concrete thing um I would just be I would I would basically just be chipping away at exposure as things get know out of hand in the next in the next one one to one to two weeks and then I think what kicks off the crazy rally Jonah is a really really really good first day inflow into the ETF if you get that then you can make the case that there's going to be a lot of inflows coming and I think that you know really high inflows on day one actually it's probably reasonably indicative of how how it's going to go over the next week or so what about lackluster inflows what like let's say it turns out like the eat Futures ETF then then it just falls apart in my opinion [ __ ] impossible timing like I don't know I feel like I'm gonna have to well I know I know one thing we are we are all going to be staring at the screens very intently on the you know the second week of January I think January 5th to January 10th is when you're supposed to be stuck in front of your screen and you're just staring at it waiting for it waiting for that headline to hit and between now and then to heck with Christmas Hanukkah just pick that low hanging fruit in these rotation trades just pay attention on crypto Twitter and rotate into stuff that hasn't quite popped yet but will I mean s STX is STX has been so annoying because we've held that for a while um and you know I'm actually I'm very on STX just as as a concept they have their Nakamoto upgrade coming in q1 which is going to make it the the entire you know the entire layer very fast um and they're GNA they're going to open up S sbtc so synthetic BTC that you know will will derive security from the main from the main uh Bitcoin chain um that's you're going to be able to Mint hundreds of millions of dollars worth of that uh Exchange are you know signed up to go go work with go work with uh STX on this and I think that it's just a great derivative play on BTC but it had just gone sideways for so long people are finally starting to wake up to it I think Hal Hal put out a nice a nice thesis on this if you want to go read it it's on it's on his it's on his Twitter page uh but I'm pretty I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish on just general BTC BTC beta still uh speaking of BTC beta Rune went bananas went from one to seven um Rune is this weird like binary thing where it's either worthless or just parabolically rallying when the rest of crypto is parabolically rallying it went to 11 in 20122 when Bitcoin briefly breached 40K and then it just like gapped down to basically zero when it went below so yeah runes runes a weird one the the claim is that there the fifth largest B TC exchange uh I believe it know they they they do they do swap a lot um they have a reasonable amount of of of T of tvl and I mean the product the product actually works um now yeah now you know but they got they they obviously got they obviously got attacked a bunch and I think it just has a very scammy reputation uh that that surrounds it but those tend to be the coins that run the hardest or the things that have some semblance of real product around them but are still viewed as very scammy because what what that what that creates is it creates a it creates a cult of behavior around that particular coin and though it creates very ve very strong hands and what it does is at a at a certain point everybody's sort of avoided it because they thought it was scammy and now that it's proven itself to at least work on on some level people start rushing in uh rushing rushing through the gates and it becomes it becomes a frenzy uh as opposed to OS to a slow a slow buildup so I mean runes runes I honestly I don't know much about it feel like we could uh we could we could pick it or pick uh pick a few pick a few coins for the next for the next podcast and just Deep dive on them um you know we can we can we can host we can host a segment that's scammer no scammer so I love that just like lightning round scammer no scam um near so basically why don't we why don't we talk about how much crypto should you own at these levels like should we should we try to think through for different types of people and different Lifestyles what a good crypto holding would be um you know you you said you you you rarely own less than 50% unless crypto's on its knees um you know I I own significantly less than than 50% uh in 2000 you know when when crypto is getting smoked so like call it end of 2022 early 2023 you know obviously now my my Holdings have rallied quite a lot but like and I've bought more but but you know I we're weirdos right like we're not like normal people so let's say that you're just a let's say that you're a nocoiner let's say that you completely don't get it you think it's all just a big casino and unlike us we're like yes exactly it's a casino casinos are valuable like let's say that you you kind of find stigma in it do you think that the average person on the street should hold a portion of their life savings on cryp in crypto even if they don't believe 100 100% 100% you think it's part of like a well-rounded portfolio well at the at the end yeah I mean well I do obviously but curious about you yeah I mean it's just different right because at the end of the day the way that I view it is I don't I don't view it as some people make the argument hey you want to hold an uncorrelated asset you want to hold an asset um you know that and the diversification helps you um just your it help helps grow grow your portfolio you can reallocate during times of stress in one asset from an asset that's doing well assuming that you know the asset that's in stress is is undervalued and the rebalancing will will work itself out and you just end up with better better result better result over time that's not some people try to make that argument for for for Bitcoin I mean the way that I think about it is this is a genuinely undervalued asset class that it it you know you look at you look at everything everything in crypto and I think on a 5 to 10 year Horizon it's just it's just undervalue and so it I I don't think I can make I can actually make a strong or significant argument from a overall portfolio construction standpoint why you should hold it I just think you should hold it because I think it's a it's a good investment I I can make an I can make a portfolio construction argument and so I think the minimum amount of crypto that every single person in you know in the world should hold with the exception of the Baby Boomers and older and I'm not talking about crypto Boomers I'm talking about like the baby boomer generation because they're retiring and they're not like trying to build wealth at this point they're more trying to take stuff out spend it give it to their children um I think that if you're younger than that generation you should hold a minimum of five to 10% of your portfolio in crypto not investment advice just this is and here's why I think so no matter how discomforting that is for you I think the reason why is that Bitcoin The Benchmark crypto asset is a proven debasement hedge and I see nothing but debasement in the future of G10 economies so I think that every portfolio deserves a hedge against that furthermore I think that it is important for you know everybody to have some exposure to emerging technology and unfortunately the Venture Capital asset class isn't really tradable or accessible to most people and I think that crypto is kind of you know if you were to do your research and and pick decent coins like you could you could thousand X some stuff but even if you just buy a broader basket of things and dip your toes in on coinbase and own a own a lot of different tokens in small size you're gaining exposure to distributed computing technology as an asset class that um you know you wouldn't otherwise have in your portfolio basically if you buy the S&P 500 you're holding you're holding a few like Mega cap stocks and then you're holding a bunch of stuff that basically doesn't rally like old Industrials yeah I I I I think so the second part of the argument is sort of what I was trying to trying to articulate which is why I don't think it's a portfolio construction argument it's just this this is a good asset class to invest in because we both think it's undervalued the first part is is is I think correct um and that's that is a good argument from a portfolio construction standpoint that you you will likely own other things in your portfolio that will be affected by by debasement and if you have Bitcoin then you very likely outperform but again that's that's Sy a bit of a market call um and that's that's what I'm trying to articulate is that that's that's a lot of what it comes down to at the at the end of the day is some of it is you know it's it's it's a it's a market call in a way that I think is I think the market call is as defendable if not more defendable than the idea that the US economy will grow over the next 20 years uh you know and that that will be reflected in stock in stock market valuations and that stock and that company valuations relative to inflation will go up over time with certainty over the next 10 to 15 years right and that is what current portfolio construction basically bases entirely around that that's that's an underlying assumption that we're we are going to grow as a country and our economy is going to grow relative to inflation if that's not true then basically it all falls apart it all falls apart except maybe if it falls apart because G10 economies have overspent their GDP growth they've mortgaged 10 or 20 or 50 years worth of growth uh to do the sort of proplate spending that went on during covid and shortly thereafter like then I think Bitcoin will protect you and stocks might not right so that's that's why and that's that that that that's a part that I I I agree with I think that you you can make you can make an argument from that perspective and you can make an argument that today it is the it it is it is not it is not only a possible outcome but it is becoming a likely outcome uh that Bitcoin will do well in the face of the actions that the G10 economies will have to take over the next 10 to 10 to 15 years yeah because the people who have taken these these steps and I'm not going to go on too much of a rant here they're the Baby Boomers they're the octogenarians who run our our economies right they they don't care they're going to they're going to sort of like hand it off the Baton pretty soon so they can they can go nuts and party right now and the rest of us are left holding the bag so I think it is important to have a debasement hedge in there and I think that debasement hedge is linked to the rest of this the all these other tokens like we talked about all this other emerging technology so I think there'll be a buoy effect I really do but uh you know ultimately on the other side of that Spectrum if you're you know if you're a working parent and you've got two young kids and you you know you're working a government job and you have you're in debt and you have a mortgage and you're you know you're 150 200% like long crypto if you include your debt like equally I I think that's pretty bananas like you should people need to tone it down yeah I mean I think I think time time Horizon is super important here right um so it also scales with Rel I mean it's it's funny it's like the like like with everything in life it's a it's a IQ meme but with net worth meme it's like right if if you if you have if you have a ton of money uh then it makes sense to I think allocate a little bit more to crypto espe you know if you allocate 20% you lose that 20 % but your day-to-day life won't be impacted greatly I think that makes sense um if you have like zero money uh you know pick your pick your moment pick your pick your time but you know that a lot of people go 100% long because they don't have that much money because they have you know a job that doesn't pay much and they don't have much in their bank account and they view it as a lottery ticket like maybe maybe I usess in this thing I'll make 5 10 grand and that'll change my whole life right and that's that's a huge mentality of of why of why people get into this and then sort of the mid the mid curve is you know you make a you make you know 80 to 100 100K a year uh you put 1% into into crypto right I mean that that's sort of the types I think uh of people I mean I I would I would also Advocate that if you have a long enough time Horizon so if you can invest over a fiveyear period and that money will not impact you um to put into crypto then I would you know basically max out that allocation based on what you think you can live on exactly that's really that's really the way that I think about it and the key word that you use there Obi is invest um I you know I know some people some good friends of mine during the 2017 Ico boom made a ton of money you know trading in and out of stuff on poniac and random shitcoin exchanges and then they kept going and bled out right it's important to kind of keep a steady hand in this stuff and just because you do well during one of these crazy bull markets doesn't make you a genius so you have to you shouldn't overtrade and and piss away do once you've made it you should try to protect some of it yeah I I agree with you I agree with you wholeheartedly I mean what's kind of interesting is going to be people this people talked about this a lot at the at the top of the last bll so I hesit to bring it up but you you even you even see it reflected in what people spend their money on today and um one thing that always interests me is because you have such a large class of people now I mean hundreds of thousands of people have made a lot of money on crypto and they all spend it in really interesting ways um like I you know one one thing that's one thing that's kind of interesting is that you know luxur luxury spending obviously went way up alongside crypto and I think those that those two things are 90% just because the the overall Market went up um but I know a lot of people that buy crypto tend to tend to spend their money on things like uh you know Miami Miami Miami real estate fancy like supercars um they there's there's a lot there's a lot of consumption that comes out that comes out of crypto uh so in a world where let's say Bitcoin hits 100K I actually think that impacts the real world economy uh a ton like that that that actually like it actually directs money flows because that's hundred that that's like that's like hundreds of billions of dollars that are going to be basically whisked out of thin air it would sh it would shift the power dynamics of society like people would be you know the like people it's just human nature when when your buddy who used to have not that much money is suddenly you know 50 times richer than you and splashing out you know there there can be some jealousy some animosity some you and I think I think uh you it might impact voting it might impact uh you know local politics uh there there's a lot of a lot of passion and fervor around crypto both both positive and negative I I think if Bitcoin went to 100K it would be pretty insane to see how Society changes any predictions like it wouldn't just be like oh the lambo dealership sold out I think other stuff would happen second secondary and tertiary effects I I do I do think one positive externality is that there you probably get a lot of wild ideas funded yeah so you know you you probably have a lot of money going into long longevity Tech you probably have a lot of just a lot more money put into like small angels will put put in put in more money to sort to Tech moonshots um I do I do think you'll see you'll see a lot more of that uh in in a in a world where where crypto grants people a lot of money I think only fans is probably like the best investment you could possibly make and that in that scario yeah that's kind of a crypto adjacent platform isn't it I just think it's going to be really funny to see how that plays out me too I mean I think I think one of the crazy things that would happen if crypto just sent and and people had all this money like I see crypto as this community of like Misfits True Believers crazies um and also people who are just like extremely pragmatic and practical about ways that that you know this peer-to-peer value transfer technology can improve their lives in the developing world and the developed world and I think that if crypto goes up it will like crypto is this group trying to make crypto happen right you have all these people busting their [ __ ] asses through every bear and bull just to build products that that you know people want to use as a solution and it hasn't really except for Bitcoin it hasn't really found its killer app quite yet aside from Maybe FTS but like I think that I think that the Richer the crypto Community becomes the more empowered and able they will become to enact their cryptographic visions of the economy of the future like real world assets take real world assets for example like a an nft deed to your house or a you know a token yeah actually all of that all of that becomes way more likely the Richer crypto people get yeah because they'll all be out there like spending on lobbying and just like like making crypto or they'll just go or they'll just go to their like they'll you make you make $100 million you go to your private bank or at JP and you go I don't want to buy your nonsense through a brokerage like sell it to me and sell it to me in token form I feel like the crypto Community will be more empowered to make crypto like fulfill its promise which is replace this entrenched shitty technology you know and that's that's sort of like it it is you know software as Anatoli said is eating the world and this is the financial software that you know suddenly it's starting to ruffle feathers and that's why there's regulatory blowback and all these other problems that it's facing as it as it tries to eat stuff and I think that the Richer crypto people become the more they'll be uh you know empowered to help crypto eat Financial uh software and economies it's a good good good argument for rwas is that they're going to be forced into existence by by crypto people anyway anyway Jonah how is how has crypto changed your life um I was besides making you you know unhappier because of your lack of sleep moving your family around three times no I've been I've been moving around long before crypto I think I think crypto is fascinating because um it it was my best PA trade salana ironically was my best PA trade that not this time in 2021 when it really ripped that that was the first time I'd ever like done a a proper job in my PA of anything so it gave me some self-confidence um but also you know I turned down a 100 million xrp when Ripple Labs offered it to me in 2013 and that would have been worth 320 million you know four years later could have started a trading company off of that so yeah it's a lot of to offer you yeah so basically and that was just their opening offer like I probably could have haggled it higher the the guys who took took it uh you know they started GSR they ended up getting seated with 150 million um you know I worked for the r when we were both at Goldman in GSR so yeah basically like crypto yeah I bought a bunch of Bitcoin in 2013 paying you know $700 and then sold it all at $400 like it's made me a better Trader I I've just just from stumbling and failing and then succeeding and missing things it's it's made me a better business business person and a better Trader and it's also introduced me to some phenomenal people like you uh because it is a community of traders that cares again in oil uh you know there there are a few traders that care but in crypto there are a lot of traders that care and that's that's exciting it's a it's a better Community you know it is it's it is a phenomenal Compu community and I'm very very happy to be very happy to be a part of it like as always it's awesome chatting with you yeah great great talking again again none of this is financial advice or more just spitballing but um you know thank you for joining please please do not take this as Financial advice ever we're both idiots we have no idea what we're doing we consistently lose money and we just do this podcast to pay our bills fun if only it paid any bills um yeah weing around do you get do you get paid for this because I don't get paid for this maybe blockworks is keeping it all they are we don't have any sponsors though maybe that's why we're not getting paid yeah that's true it's good it's a good point well if you want to sponsor the podcast don't reach out to us cuz I don't think yeah we're Anonymous talk to blockworks I guess let to manage that um all right good times everybody see you in two weeks [Music] adios

we were like should we get a retail Trader on the show Obby was like yes no brainer answer I is like the like the William wallet of retail I would clarify this like he's not very much so not retails but the leader of retail I try I try to help him out bro I try to help him out the quarterback of retail um yeah do do you ever wear jayen herd style eye paint when you when you show up to Trading bro you know what I should do I should like I should do streams and come out like I'm like I'm a football player like full costume I need like a a mic costume bro like stream yeah just show up to a salana hackathon with that that like the super turbo um warlord gear no I need that [Music] that's all right welcome back to a very special episode of a000x we have a wonderful new guest we got anom on who's going to be bullshitting around with us for the next hour or so as we try to unpack what's happening in the market just for a time stamp it is 1:53 PM Tuesday November 21st and we're about an hour out from the uh announcement where Janet Yellen is gonna talk about how she took down CZ so headlines are just slapping the tape right now markets whiping around BNB up and down 10% we don't know what's GNA happen um I don't know we could break it down into scenarios like if she says X then y happens anden what what what are you how are you trading this um honestly I'm expecting like uh Bitcoin to hold strong here that's that's what I've been I've been looking at I think alts kind of had their little run they've done like two 3x I think Alt pairs are kind of topping but Bitcoin has been strong um and I think if like if this this regulatory news basically if it's just a fine and binance can keep like operating as they were prior to I think we're fine I think we just keep like keep going up we might like chop around a bit in the like 33 to 37 area but I'm I'm expecting Bitcoin to break out before um end the year I also have coinbase I have a ton of coinbase so like all scenarios are coinbase um yeah I think I think I think you tweeted this out but like basically everything at this point sends coinbase to Infinity yeah like no matter what the outcome is unless I mean unless unless they come out and they say every single exchange that has ever operated we're going to come after you next I guess that's the one scenario but in that case I mean might might as well just pack up right we'll we'll all go back to trading uh pink pink slips or something we war game this a little bit in my old place we you know we're chatting about this a bit before the podcast there there's sort of three scenarios right scenario one is like CZ and handcuffs like International Manhunt bunch of you know crazy ofac AML violations uh scenario 2 is just limbo we've been in scenario 2 for I don't know how long it feels like years but probably just months while getting getting a little tired of it and then scenario three is is this where there's a a manageable slap on the wrist and the thing just sends after a while because you know binance cesy pay their fine and you know binance is still dominating the marketplace after that so I don't know I I agree with you anom I I think uh I I think I think you're right I think this this thing just keeps chopping but with an upwards Trend but I wanted to ask you against the backdrop of what you just said um how long have you like tell us a little bit about yourself how long have you been in crypto have you seen any scenarios similar to this during during your history trading you know previous exchanges Under Fire well like how how are you how are you referencing this versus the you know the earlier parts of your career in crypto um yeah I've been in crypto since like 2017 um basically I was I was a software engineer before but was just trading crypto on the side um I was basically doing both like at the same time they were full-time crypto in um like 2021 like mid 2021 um see I've seen like I guess two like one and a half one full cycle and then I came in like Midway through 2017 so I was like I guess half that's when I didn't know what I was doing um but yeah I think it's similar to like the bitmex lawsuit which was in 2020 um and that I believe it was like Q4 2020 I referenced it earlier this year when the lawsuit against Finance came out I was like yo last time they did this it was like pico bottom we just ripped it from um like when that news dropped I think it it's kind of similar it's like most of these things if they don't shut down the exchange entirely it's like that's the peak fear when the lawsuit and everything comes out um and it's like it kind of gets priced in from there like crypto is supposed to operate um in a way such that it doesn't get shut down by one exchange going under one exchange not being like not being um in control of of everything Bitcoin is like on its own it's it's thing entirely um and we kind of see that in the reaction to these markets when people are just like no [ __ ] you we're not selling our crypto because the government's coming after us um but but yeah I think earlier this year it's like when we bottomed around 25k that was the initial uh lawsuit announcement and now we're 37k and we're kind of like coming to the end of it so it seems like we're we're kind of getting all the bad news out of the way with black rock on kind of the side of we're going to be pushing for all these ETFs next year it seems like we're in like the final stages of the worst part of the regulatory stuff to me this kind of came at a time where I was already thinking about reducing exposure a ton so this actually makes it this actually makes it way harder for me I mean you look at I mean you're the biggest Soul bow I know but it it definitely looks the weakest like it that has looked in a very long time here like all the all the spoit all the VCS that were chasing it that didn't want to buy at 19 they don't want to buy 25 they all bought at like 4550 and they got their then they got their little pop little pop decision and now there just doesn't seem to be a SPO it in the market for this thing anymore and so the whole that that that dragged up I think honestly everything in a sense and obviously you had the B the BTC run as well but now I'm thinking that it's it's back to btcd I think people had their fun with alts and I what what I'm kind of looking for is maybe we Cho down to 34 33 and then you just rotate right back right right back in alts and you can you get allocate to all your small caps again but right now it just it looks it looks kind of tough to be long if you're just based on the charts then the flip side of the argument is that binance removes everything that you're worried about then you just have the ETF then you have the eth ETF then probably a salon ETF after that yeah so you know it's kind it's kind of a it's one of the weirdest spots I think we've been in the last two months I mean the last two months were just so straightforward yeah no for sure for sure rip everything no I agree though I think I think El are like near near top like all BDT um pairs for sure I def can see a scenario where it's like we get a Bitcoin breakout and all it's pull back and everybody's like well I don't have enough Bitcoin and then we get to I don't know like mid 40s maybe um and then like when when we pull back from there that's when alt start having their fun again when bitcoin's chopping around higher um cuz I feel like people are just ignoring ignoring Bitcoin it's really not that far off the highs um btcd is on the highs right I mean in that in one sense it's it's not being ignored it pulled back a bit I know yeah you're right it wasn't like 54 went to like 52 now it's kind of popping again yeah BTC btcd flipped 52% into support I know [ __ ] chart dude yeah I know that actually like I I don't know how I feel about charting this but that is a c chart that is that is like look I mean if if I were to draw a line there that would be a sexy line no I'm looking at it too I I'm with you I'm with you so okay so can you walk us through do you think do you think of salana as an ALT is is salana an ALT coin yeah so definitely an ALT um I think like this this cycle will submit it as as third that's how I'm kind of looking at it um just I think this cycle the focus for eth is they're kind of pivoting to the modular um thesis and in that thesis I just am not sure how the value gets distributed across the entire stat because there's like 10 different l2s all of them are going to have tokens some of them are going to be doing offchain da versus using eat for da some of them may use Celestia for da some of them may use near for da like Ian da it's looking like eth is going to be more of a settlement layer and that transition from everything happening on ethereum to ethereum being more of a settlement layer and then the execution having happening on other blockchains is just I'm not clear on how the value acrs across the stack but I think it's pretty clear that salana is on the complete opposite of that thesis so it's like the integrated L1 do everything on the L1 you don't need to scale via l2s yet um and it's like the monolithic opposite of ethereum so you have the settlement layer then you have Bitcoin and then you have one integrated L1 and I think they're like by far in the lead against the other l1s right now just because of everything that they've gone through and how strong the community is um like the devel developer community and the teams there now are like much stronger than they were um a couple years ago so I think there'll be like a solid three so you're an engineer you said uh can you tell us why so many engineers just love salana like what what's is it is it an amazing engineering experience versus evm there something computer sciency that us like Finance guys can't understand help me help me get it um I think that just more they're more practical on this the scaling arguments like of ethereum versus salana salana guys don't are not as focused on the fully decentralized like everybody thr run a node everybody needs to be a value the chain um the salana guys are like no if you're going to make a a like globally globally decentralized system that can operate on um like at the same speed as what NASDAQ you're going to need some high- powerered machines that are the nodes operating this network um then they kind of focus on that as as like the practical way um of how this is going to work long term there's no really way of getting around there like it doesn't really make sense to do it any way and I think like I don't know about the rust versus like solidity how many Engineers like prefer that I know everybody in crypto is like very cool um like very secure with the evm and I think that's why a lot of the crypto guys um are so big on ethereum and even the l2s who focus on the ebm um but salana attracts a lot of developer talent that don't really have that experience in crypto already so there's a ton of rust Engineers outside of crypto don't know anything about crypto but they know rust and know how like program rest also Salon gets a lot of those um a lot of that attention as well but I I I like was a developer but I've not been a developer in crypto I'm not going to claim to be like I've built things on E built things on Salada I don't have that um frame of reference I think eth just benefited in the last run from the the majority of people that were getting in that were that were getting into crypto or like actually just general retail you you you didn't get as many builders that were coming in in my in my opinion is you actually got on the tail end of the cycle so on the tail end of the cycle is when is when people okay I made money I quit my job like I can start I can start coming in I can start I I can start developing and so I think what you just saw especially in 2021 is across across the board you also just saw a lot of the people that were coming in were just building copycats they were building all these use useless useless applications just a bunch of a bunch of casinos uh and now I think we're finally we're finally getting away from that in in some in some capacity which has made me pretty bullish on just like individual assets now so there are a bunch of things that I look at that I couldn't really do this in in in 2019 and 2020 just stuff that I wanted to buy that I would feel comfortable holding for a year and just not thinking about it other than other than BTC and E BTC and eth were kind of it and then everything else was just a straight rotation trade and now I feel like there's stuff that I'm willing to hold for a long time so for example I played Prime it's a dope game like right it's actually it's actually like pretty good it's like okay this is this is good like this is usable this is I mean like fine you know uh it's value eye but I think you know you I I can hold that for the next six months and feel pretty confident there but anyway I mean I just think that there's actually a ton of really good stuff out there and I know you keep tweeting about the cycle bags just like yo they bags you just you just buy these you hold on to them you forget about it yeah write it what are your cycle bags shill us so that we can buy them for you oh man one of my psycho bags well you you just call one out dude um but yeah my Mains are like this cycle I think coinbase I like a lot I think they're in a really good um position um with like the spot ETFs coming um they're going to be basically the the custodian for all of those and then also them expanding like intern with their pers um and coinbase Cloud um like for staking um they're like working with a ton of other chains outside of just ethereum too and I think they've actually pivoted really well um to be more like crypto Centric crypto native with how they're operating I know coinbase got a lot of flak the past few years for kind of not being in touch with what crypto people were looking for and I I think in the past few months they've done a really a really good job of that I think the base L2 is also um super super strong from a like retail onboarding perspective because they have so many kyc people on coinbase if they're able to get them onto actual like on chain we have like 100 million people on the coinbase like centralized exchange but on chain it's like me Obi like everybody on Twitter like it's just like a you know it's just like us we need like get retail onto on chain still we haven't really accomplished that yet in crypto and I think Bas is one of the the best um chances of doing that so I like coinbase um I love slada as you guys know for for many reasons I really need to go into detail there I feel like um parallel is actually one of my um I didn't expect it to be like a long-term play but I started looking more into it um and the game is actually like really complex and flushed out like as a as a trading card game um there's layers to it like you have to play it for a while to get good at it and really understand like how to be good at the game which I think is really dope and you've seen them kind of Pierce into the web 2 segment um of gaming like people who play What's the other card game is it magic magic the Gathering I think is the other one um yeah so you have people who play that and they like like parallel and once you tap that market of Gamers who don't care about crypto but the game is good enough for them to play it and you have an option to onboard them without needing to buy an nft or like whatever know what crypto is and then you have the crypto native people um who also are going to be the first ones using all these applications Prime is had a really cool intersection there where they can tap um multiple different markets and then like I said the other day I was like this cycle is the one where we're going to see a lot more actual strong businesses come out other than just these exchanges which print money off fees um because a a game that people really enjoy and are willing to spend money in game to like up like be better than other people and like upgrade through the ranks that's going to be a successful business if they can on board a good amount of consumers that are willing to spend um regardless of the Market's up or down so I think you're going to see some businesses emerge in cycle and that could be one of them so I like I like prime a lot um just looking at parallel Alpha here just on open C looking at these trading cards I mean some of them are worthless some of them are trading for like one or two e uh it looks kind of like magic is that what the experience is like magic the Gathering but because I always thought of magic as this amazing game but like the exchange for cards is super shitty and you deal with these B old men and they they take you out um here it's just wait wait wait wait back back back up Jonah how do you know anything about magic how do how do you know anything about magic like it came out during my high school years right like did you did you actually play this game did you play Magic you played magic yeah I mean not like a lot like I I'm not funny not seems it seems like a reasonable about it's an IRL game um that it's you ever played any tournaments no no I didn't make that far it was it was more just like with kids uh kids that I knew from school oh man that's I I I did not Peg you for Magic the G guy so is is that what this is like parallel is like a crypto like a where the the cards are nfts and you play the game and the cards like enable you in the same way that they would enable you in magic yeah so there's like four different I think there's I want to say there's four factions let me not mess it up I think there's four different factions um and each faction has their own like special abilities um your deck of cards I want to say it's 20 cards you get a deck of cards um and then you play against somebody else and each card has its own like attack defense whatever special like ability and you try and basically just take the other person's health points down to zero before they kill you um I played like Yu-Gi-Oh so that's my my comparison played u- when I was younger it's my my closest comparison for me um but they also have other games outside of just the the trading cart game so that's the first one and then they plan on making other games also their newest one that they're working on is like a AI um first person based on the parallel avatars um and basically your AI does like um like goes out on Quest and stuff and you like update your character as it goes so that's their next their next game coming out it's going to be a whole like franchise of of things this is bananas I was just I just ran the numbers on openc after you brought it up I mean we're looking at 161 million dollars worth of volume that's printed on just these trading cards since it since the project kicked off like there's real stuff happening here kind of under our noses and you know part of why we wanted to have you on so badly was because you know you're paying attention to it like a for me I'm just too [ __ ] old OB ob's too busy uh slinging institutional volume and the and the tokens that can handle it like we need people who are in the weeds looking at interesting stuff thank you for telling me about this try to try to buy some cards Yeah man so you can start playing it I get you the the beta's um you can get access to the beta the open Beta comes at end of the year but I I can get you cool yes please yeah I mean the the TR The Trenches have been so profitable I mean not that not that not that I can not that I can like play them in any size CU it's just it's not it's not really my game but as an outside Observer who pays attention to the people that pay attention to the trenches I mean it's uh it's it's kind of nuts just all the all the onchain stuff that's been uh that's been popping off left and right Mone be made we we've had some you know polished billionaires on the show who come from like interest rate trading we've talked to you know Anatoli from salana who's a Dev and know Super Genius we haven't we haven't talked to any people like retail type people in the trenches so how did you like can you tell us what it is that attracted you to crypto and then tell us like how you managed to survive these cycles and develop your process without a formal trading background how how did you do it so I went to Georgia Tech I studied computer science there um and my minor was in business so one of my classes for my minor was this emerging Technologies class and my professor was a huge Bitcoin guy he was like I was one of the focuses in that class is Bitcoin so that's when I first learned about Bitcoin um I've always kind of been at the intersection of like finance and Tech so I'm I mod business my major was was CS so I've kind of always been like in that that area um and then when I graduated in 2017 I had a mentor um at the job I was working at and he was a huge crypto guy and he was like dude I'm like making a ton of money trading on like bitrix bitmex like all these sites he starts telling me about all coins I was like okay let me look into this uh and figure this out and start learning how to do this that's when I started Trading um 2017 I mean I was always I've always been on Twitter so like when I when I always been on on Twitter as just like been online so I've been online forever like I was Tumblr guide played like World of Warcraft played League of Legends always been on on the internet so I was active on Twitter before I even knew about crypto and when I started looking into crypto I was like well let me figure out on Twitter who the crypto people are and that's when I started figuring like found Kobe found like Trader M like LOM Dart all those guys um and when I was learning how to trade in 2017 I started posting charts like everybody else was posting charts I didn't have any followers but I posted at T of charts when I was learning ta um from those guys they're talking about like how Cycles work how allcoins versus Bitcoin work um how like money flows down the ecosystems and all that I saw it in 2017 um didn't trade the cycle well at all I was like all in Al when Bitcoin was ripping just like was down at ton against Bitcoin um it didn't do a great job of selling the top either but I saw the cycle and like knew what it looked like and how to play it when it came back again the second time so in 2020 um when D5 summer happened it started popping off I was actually playing poker with a lot of crypto people and wasn't really that active in markets but then people were like yo started talking about shitcoins on Unis swap I was like okay let me figure out what this is and get back into this um because actually my boy Jeremy we started we made like a group chat on telegram um that's when everybody was like trading against each other trading micro cats on unisoft and we like went from poker straight into like trading on unof it was funny you you didn't leave the market right like you you you were in it you had your finger on the pulse the whole time you didn't like take a breather in 2019 and look at other stuff right no I took a breather I was I was like more focused on my actual day job in like 2019 I traded 2018 2019 um actually my my daughter was born late 2019 so that was also right around when when Co happened so that whole time period I was like not looking at markets and then the co crash happened actually what happened was I remember bit Lord was on Twitter talking about covid in China and I've been in China and he's walking around Shanghai or wherever he was in Beijing Shanghai I think it was Shanghai or Beijing and there's nobody on the streets so I was like that is completely wrong for China because I've been there and I know what those Street look like so something is is up um and I started looking at markets us markets and in my head I'm like as soon as Co gets to New York we're like we're [ __ ] because the distance between everybody on the subway is like we're face to face I'm like if it spreads that fast people like it doubles every day I'm like as soon as the first case gets into New York it's like it's wraps for here and people were not really worried about it so I I was short Bo I like bought puts on on Boeing thinking like okay well whenever people do figure out this is like an actual thing airlines are gonna get crushed so I was short boing and I was I was short like right before that that crazy crash happened in March um that printed pretty well on that but I I closed it too early I didn't expect it to go like minus 70% a couple weeks um but yeah after that I started like paying attention more the market I like okay everything crashed I we're playing poker with crypto people then people start talking about defi summer everything ripped I look at the a chart I'm like how the [ __ ] did I miss this 100x um and then I saw Bitcoin was trading at 10K so I'm like well Bitcoin is 100% at least going back to alltime high I I know that for a fact I'm trying to tell everybody like yo bitcoin's gonna rip soon because all these alts have done all this all these multiples and Bitcoin hasn't moved yet so that money's going to start flowing down into Bitcoin and they didn't even know what Bitcoin was they're like dude what is bitcoin coin we know ethereum and we know unisoft we don't care about Bitcoin because they that their intro to crypto was just trading on unisoft uh so that's how I got like active again that cycle Bitcoin was like my first big trade and I was like okay what else should I look at uh gas F sping on the theum then I started looking at salana um like that was probably my best trade that cycle um but I just had that like framework for how to rotate Capital between Bitcoin altcoins that I knew a little bit of ta um and it's always been easy for me to pick up new stuff just like SO trading was really not not hard for me to pick up but that that was one of the weirdest periods I think when people were getting into crypto through Unis Swap and eth and they weren't touching because I I remember I mean back in uh back in 2016 2017 everybody everybody's first stop was Bitcoin so I was kind of used to I was used to the opposite happening right where you get the wealth effect from BTC into into alts and that was that was sort of the mentality um and then people just started onboarding because of all these crazy crazy yields that existed in in defi like whoa I can make 100% I can make th% I can you know just literally 5x my money in in a month if I if I go in a d if I go on a D5 first and people were just going straight to a b you know small caps on uni on Unis swap so that that was that was a that was a wild that was a wild period but it just shows you how how much the crypto Market changes honestly a year but also how much it like the the same the same things will happen over again you just have to pattern match sort of differently it's like when your teacher G gave you a like a problem set and then the test was a different version of that problem set just have to figure out how to like super superimpose it onto onto the onto the new problem andon was saying that the um that the uh the money back then was in the defi summer was trickling from alt into Bitcoin why why is it that this cycle it should be the opposite and money will trickle from Bitcoin into alts I mean I don't think it was directly just like altcoins into Bitcoin I think there was also a t of trafi flows that were like that push Ming up that around that time period um but just generally the the people who are really good at trading crypto Cycles their core base is always Bitcoin and some of them now it's Bitcoin and E so it's like if you have these people the people who are buying all coins when they're like floored minus 90% um usually know what they're doing and they're going to protect their gains by going back into Bitcoin so whenever those people print off off alts they're like oh let me take profit into Bitcoin take profit into e um so I think you have the crypto natives who a lot of times are on side the same size as these funds and they just know what they're doing um so they they control a lot of like how the market the market flows happens that's generally why I don't think it's directly like Bitcoin alts alts Bitcoin um I think this cycle there's a lot of well I don't know if this is true or not but I think there's going to be a lot of institutional focus on bitcoin just because of how this spot ETF is coming um and like think his connections with people in in finance are massive so my head I'm like okay Bitcoin is goingon to be the first thing that all these people who are like have gold allocations have stock allocations whatever have real estate like oh let me get one two% of Bitcoin let me add that to my my portfolio now that black rock is stamping it as safe for people so that's what I'm thinking there is going to happen um and then that also legitimizes the crypto space further across the board so if Bitcoin is stamped then e is next and it's like okay what are people building in crypto that makes sense outside of traditional like Tech and finance and once that happens that's when like the massive everybody's like okay crypto is cool like crypto is is here to stay I think this is that cycle where that happens people argued it was it was last cycle I think you you could could make the argument but just because of how um new defi everything was I think it's a lot easier to make that argument this cycle um once it's been through the ringer and like survived um that's how how I'm thinking about it so in your in your poker circles in the uh in the retail community that you are clearly what we like just look at your Twitter I think I I think like a leader in the like the like I I VI is like the like the William wallet retail you're likey Jin bro love your Twitter um we were like should we get a retail Trader on the show Obby was like yes no brainer I I would clarify this like he's not very much so not retails but the leader of retail I try I try to help him out bro I try to help him out the quarterback of retail um yeah do do you ever wear Jaylen herdz style eye paint when you when you show up to your training bro you know what I should do I should like I should do streams and come out like I'm like I'm a football player like full costume I need like a a mic costume bro like stream stream yeah the show is salana hackathon with that like the super turbo warlord gear no I need that that's it among the circles that that you lead sorry not running that you lead um what's the mood like can you give us a sense of what what you know just people who are passionate about crypto and and this market and it's this technology what they're saying after they' just been beaten up throughout 2022 well I think there's there's two I'll say there's two main groups you have the developers and the builders um I'm closest with the Salada like Salada community of of Builders not as much um with the eth guys but know some of them too and during even when I was at breakpoint in 2022 they're super excited about the future of crypto and everything that they're building from like defi stuff consumer stuff um like decentralized physical infrastructure stuff everything across the board they're just super excited about the future and what they're building and that energy that I felt there in breakpoint made it a lot easier to be bullish once a lot of this year even when the entire time is was like dude you're a [ __ ] idiot what are you talking about um like I've talked to these people I I understand this Tech like the advantages it has versus eth and other other chains um this thing is going to turn around eventually so that was like an easy made that easier um for me to make that bet having those relationships with with them and talking to them um and then on the other side it's like the retail degenerates um it's like everybody is trying to 100x whatever they have whatever like spare funds that they have it's like that everybody's trying 100x um you have like right now I've talked about it a little bit on Twitter but you have a ton of people who are working their day job but they're not making enough like substantially to be able to afford like a really nice house or anything like in a short amount of time they're going to be working they know if they like calculate how much I'm saving year over year going to be working whatever for a long ass time they see crypto and they're like okay I can shave a few years off the back of that by making some extra money in markets and so everybody's like Z answer what should I buy what should I buy like what what are we looking at this cycle like how do I whatever 10x um so I get a ton of questions like that it's just like the energy of people in markets they seek kind of a way um to get some extra cash honestly and like a lot of people were retail trading side of crypto focus on that and then you have the builders who are more focus on dude no we're building real things here for the future um of Finance future of tech it's like a cool it's a dichotomy there it's nice to hear it from you I mean we've had this thesis sitting in our like financialized ibr Tower here Obby and I have where you know about why it is that there is an interesting casino type element to crypto but it's you know you bring up a really good point the just life in America and in many many other places has kind of gotten away from you know normal people and that's not fair right so you have to invest well in order to achieve Financial outcomes that are you know used to be part of the like standard package that you get just work in a government job like my mom worked for the postal service and bought a house in the hills in California like on a government that's not happening anymore so you know so in terms of crypto like I see the appeal um and it is cool that people can get out there and actually trade some tech that has a future but obviously there's a lot of risk involved so um yeah yeah I it's tough to navigate isn't it I see a lot of comparison well I wasn't around in early 2000s but from looking at it it seems similar to me that like era where a ton of companies like popped out and they were the the Giants of this these past two decades but there also were a ton of companies that went to zero it's like all the altcoins that we've had since 20 2013 if you look at the [ __ ] the top 100 in 2013 like 90 of those coins are not even around now you go to 2015 you do it again it's like most of them are not even around you go to 2017 you do it against it's like some of them are still here um but that's like the risk of of like you said trading crypto it's like some of this stuff is going to fail I don't think that's necessarily bad but it's also why when you are right on certain things way you can hit 100x cuz the market is still small enough that these big guys can't just shut size into it um so you're kind of front running all those guys that's the way the way I look at it's kind of similar to like that doc ERA this crypto crypto explosion and that's I think why you see so much so much community in crypto because if you anybody that knows crypto like seriously knows that you have to pay attention to make money like it's actually it's actually kind of tough especially if if you're playing the gambling game right if you're playing the small cap game you know that you have to look at that position every you know like every week at least yeah playing on chain dude yeah if you're playing on chain you you just have to be looking at it you can't just not right cuz for at at any moment the founders are going to Mint you know you're just out yeah dude you're right dude it's like if you you just look at the look at ethereum and how many like how strong that Community is that's a [ __ ] cult community of eth people they've been holding eth for years they just never sell it like they just literally just like hold a [ __ ] ton of their net worth in ethereum and that's why you see these shitcoins pop up like who are who are these guys throwing like 200 300K at [ __ ] five mil 10 mil market cap coins it's because people are literally storing all their wealth like on chain um so you have a ton of people like that it's just like that's how the like the I I gotta ask a question about that because this is a game that I used to play and I used to be in on in 2020 I was on the on like flipping stuff like bass yams all this random stuff in in 2020 I have I actually have no idea what's going on on shade right now like I I I don't even know how how people are how people are finding these small caps like I only see them when they're like 15 to 20 mil at this point but sometimes I see posting in chats of buying like 500k H how are you f like do you play this and how do you find these things I I play it a little bit I'm honestly like I always say I'm I'm second like I'll see I'm in so many chats dud like people are Lally sending me stuff launchers at 100 100K 200k I'm like how are you even like they track a lot of the new launches and they have lists of like deployers that they know are good some deployers are bad and they run like the rug check on on all this stuff they're like oh this this is safe lick is locked who who launched this like what's what's the guy behind this um they play a lot of the 100K 200k games I know a lot of people that do that so I'm I'm there watching it what I'm usually at is like once something is kind of like a little bit of exit velocity that's when I start paying attention to stuff I'm like okay let me figure out in the five mil the 10 mil what has it gone to zero yet new launch is there um that's kind of that's how I found um unibot early this year I didn't I missed it I was like people bought it at like 30k 40K 50k market cap I don't know how in all these chats um but they saw it was like oh telegram bought for trading shitcoins I'm like telegram bought for trading shitcoins that makes a [ __ ] ton of sense I'm watching you guys do this every day and I know people were using Maestro which didn't have a a coin uh Associated I'm like oh this is M show with a coin this one of the easiest thesises I've seen and I was just looking at the like metrics on it and saw how much money they were making off um fees and like user activity was starting to turn up being consistent I think I I bought it around like I think I bought it around 5 mil the first time and then I like started talking about it more like around 20 20 mil or something like that and then told people about it close to like like 30 40 or some somewhere around there but I was like yeah this makes sense and this is not like this is something that will if they do well won't go to zero um so there's like a few things that pop up like that the new kind of like free launches and it's cool because then VCS will pick it up like they got they ended up getting VC investment once they um like showed their their Market fit and that was a whole I like turned into a whole section on like coin gecko there was like other people launching trading like telegram bot coins all these devs hopped on like oh this is the new meta it's kind of cool how that stuff literally these metas um like they come to fruition in the trenches and then it's like then they hit the timeline and then the VC guys get it and it's like now to thing but a lot of that stuff happens in like with these Bens on chain that's kind of how def5 summer happened too like everybody's like yield farming um then it turned into a real thing but obious said is because people are storing their money um in these coins and like they're they're really bought into the future of Finance being in crypto so it's like you have people ready to test out all these things um and if you didn't have them then none of the stuff would be around okay followup question so people we know that people store their wealth in eth and then when they feel rich in eth they start lifting crypto punks and you know erc20 tokens um y what's the I guess maybe this is kind of an interesting trade idea that we could chop through through here on the podcast salana if it is a token of this next cycle and people are storing their wealth in it which I think you know based on the what I've seen on Twitter it sounds like people are indeed storing a significant percentage of their wealth in salana um if salana starts to roof more or even even the roofing that it's done so far like what what sort of uh trickle down effects are we going to get like what what are some interesting projects on salana or nft Pro nft things that you think will get picked up by the the new salana rich people yeah I think I think it's going to happen in the same way dude um I've been saying for a while people wrote off salana alts because last cycle they were basically all scams like literally um it was like oxy uh Maps uh what are some of the other ones there's a few other ones that were just really really bad oxy and maps are wild to me actually one thing that people aren't paying attention to this is a complete total tangent then I I want to get back to the point but oxan Maps actually make up something like 800 million of the claims on FTX there's a massive oxy Maps position those those tokens are basic they're they're worth zero they're zero yeah and so so the the hole is actually smaller than people expect because of that there's this massive just like fake uh amount of money that people are asri ascribing to the whole but it was like crazy I remember when oxy raised they were like raising a 400 million back in uh I think 2021 maybe maybe it was end of end of 2020 and the current consensus at the time was just like yeah I mean AP it because it's because it's on salana but I mean it's probably not gonna ever not not not GNA ever out to much I mean what what like what's out there that's better now than yeah so see I I think um I think you're going to see that wealth effect happen like if salana gets repriced up like over a 100 um and has like that second cycle that ethereum had its second time where it rips you're going to have these teams on salana when they launch tokens people are going to be aping them same way they're going to be aping NS on salana um what are some of the good teams I think there a few really strong teams the GTO guys I like a lot so GTO Labs is like a me um me team they also run validators so they have also have a liquid staking um version of of salana which is like GTO Soul so they're a combination of like flash Bots and Lio on E but they're on salana um they don't have a token yet they're doing like a points program right now but if they do launch a token I think that'll probably one of the strongest ones on salana it's like gito um then margin fi they're similar to AB uh they're like a lending borrowing protocol um they're doing some pretty cool stuff like one of the one of the issues last cycle happened with the risk limits on I think it was I want to say it was soulen I don't want to throw them under the bus but there was like a huge position on like one of the the big Landing borrowing protocols on salana and the risk parameters were just not great so it's like how did somebody build this this position and it like ended up [ __ ] up a lot of a lot of salana defi when they had like unwind it um so margin fight guys have been like really really H like hammering the nail on on being safe with hike how they operate how they scale up how they um are building from like ground up I like them a lot Mari like they're like a um like Salada what other teams are good oh like Jupiter juper juper against a lot of good reviews that was the one I'm Jupiter's is GNA be a beast I think they're um they're like an aggregator um kind of similar to one inch but literally everybody on Salon is trading trading through Jupiter and the experience like when everybody starts using like dude it's so much faster it's so it's so easy it's so like fluid to use compared to these dexas on eth and that's just because of like the the underlying salana like the tech infu I used mango back in the day before um salana Su up I thought I was slick looking and you know cool but um at the end of the day you need like real use cases on these chains in order for the a DEX aggregator to be relevant and uh so what do you think like are there any exciting games on salana like what what are the what are the sort of big applications that are going to bring in people over from web too they're gonna hit salana or do you think we're not we're not there yet in the cycle no I think we're there um which games a aui is probably the biggest game right now now on salana um but there's a lot of new ones that I think we'll see coming out um like more recent this year I think the what I'm really trying to figure out for salana what I think is going to be the best play is figuring out which dend plays on Salada are going to work like if I can hit those really well that's one um application that is like very very um well suited to only be able to do on Salada versus like ether other chains because of um like how much more efficient it is how much you can do yeah it's like if you're going to scale something um globally you you need to be doing it like on Soul so stuff like helium um like Hive mapper uh like renders is big already they're like over a billion um but applications like those that are like only possible on salana apps I think those are going to be the best players I got to figure out which which ones I W to um when to hit honestly don't have a good list for that yet but of tokens wise so much of crypto is just trying to predict what people are going to do next so like where where where where are people right so for example like two months three months five months ago six months ago whatever so you can sit there you go I know at some point in the future I'm 100% confident at some point in the future that AI will be talked about by everybody and therefore you just want to exp AI coins I don't know when and I don't know how I don't know what like I don't know what the catalyst is I just know that at some point people are talking about this so I'm G to buy it yeah right and that's sometimes when when prices are when prices are low when you've you know I think anytime bitcoin's below know 70% of its all-time highs that's like kind of your mentality when you when you approach the market is I'm just going to buy certain things because I know at some point people are going to talk about them whether it's like a real bull market or a fake bull market or an echo bubble or like I don't care y I know it's like front running it's front running the attention dude that's it's literally attention it's like those are why um like the the Euphoria Peaks happen Euphoria Peaks happen when the like you You' no like there's no other attention left to be spent on this thing like if everybody's talking about this thing everybody's all in there's nobody left to buy that's when Euphoria is like these Peaks happen if you front run that um that's how you make a lot of money in crypto but I think what's what's interesting from the culture side is like nfts so you have crypto Punks on eth actually what are what are they at right now 60 e floor something like that oh yeah so they're still like over 100k um but I think they they went as low as 40 they they're up 50% off the lows I see 55.3 it's pretty good yeah good I think a good bet to make if you're um betting on the future of crypto if you think solada is going to be like that third chain to e is trying to figure out what the crypto Punk equivalent is going to be um so I've been trying to to think through that also I think madlads are like possibly a good candidate there because that the team is doing a lot of different things for the Salada ecosystem like they have the wallet backpack wallet then they're also building the exchange and they also have the X nft um infrastructure which is like executable nfts that kind of have all these other different features that you can do with them um and madlad is like their they're basically their nft but I don't know if they're going to be the one or another one but but yeah one thing I like about the way that you you your thought process has been explained over the course of the the podcast here is that you don't get too married to stuff and when shit's about to fall out of bed like in covid you didn't look to crypto to to save you you went and bought some Boeing puts right so how like maybe could you talk a little bit it's it's exciting to be like hey I think this is going to 10x or this is going to 100x or this crazy ass project knowing parent value is about to go into you know hype mode you can see these you can see these Casino style tulip tulip uh price bubbles occurring before they do but like how do you risk manage stuff like when how do you know when you're in Peoria and it's time to unload I don't have rules around how like big portions of my portfolio honestly I I trade more off the individual um individual chart individual coins like I did pretty well with Pepe earlier this year um probably my best trade this year but I saw it it was one of those situations where everybody was piling in short and you're piling in short on a meme that has no inherent value it's only people buying and selling it's literally just retail versus all the other traders in the market so you have all these Traders going short and it got listed on what I think it was buit or whatever it was um I was like oh this is definitely going to squeeze I already had like I I was lucky enough to buy it earlier like bought it on chain and it was like pop a popular meme in crypto the [ __ ] frog is everywhere I'm like okay this makes sense to to capture some attention in crypto then it got listed everybody shorting it I'm like dude they're gonna get steamrolled trying to go against this thing um but the way I look for Tops uh ta wise I think volume is actually really really good um when the volume spikes are like 2 3x the previous dailies and they're larger than the like total market cap of the coin you're usually pretty close to a top like on sh on she shib like when shib topped it was doing something crazy like multiple billions of dollars when Pepe topped this year when it got listed on binance I think the volume that day was like 2.4 billion like meme was at like it was it topped like 1 billion or 1.6 something you're looking at you're looking at Pepe versus usdt right you're not looking at like pair pair charts for the volumes you're looking you're looking at the straight up yeah USD I mean I was I was like I was had a position on chain and I had a long on this shady ass exchange like only way I could get long on it and I was like closing both at the same time but yeah I was really on like the low time frame like five minute chart just just trading off ta um but yeah it's like those those volume spikes are usually pretty pretty good indicators trying to think of what else I don't know I it's really off ta just like once [ __ ] starts going parabolic like they know it's going to top out top out soon shit's done doubling like every other day oh that's the hardest part but also the most lucrative part is just staying sober about this stuff when you look at your your coinbase account or you know or your your wallet your onchain wallet your metamask whatever and it's just exploded it's easy to be like all right cool I'm good wait you know now it's we're 3x in from here you know it's very hard to stay calm and think like all right what's an objective framework that I can ingest now that will help me lock this in and not get too uh greedy Jonah one one one rule that's been really helpful is is actually to track like emotional response to things so if I ever find if I if I've refreshed my portfolio five times that day I got to think about selling yeah I like what I'm about to send my boys like a screenshot of my my you know like let me let me take some off like without without fail I'm like I'm like on my I'm on my exchange I'm like oh what what what are we at now how much money did I make today yeah you know I'm I'm serious but like it's because because I think you like people are a lot more similar than we give them credit for and so if a lot of other people are doing that as well and then at some point people start to wait they're like okay wait a second this is nuts like this is a lot I gotta I gotta start getting out I've been saying this year like I a good um portfolio allocation to have so separate your core portfolio from your dgen portfolio do like say like 70% like 70% uh whatever Bitcoin eat salana whatever your highest conviction alts are put that in that bucket don't really try and trade that all that much then you with the other 30% do whatever it is on chain whatever on pers on like yield farming some random new launches do that with a smaller Port partion of your portion of your portfolio um and then like redistribute that to your higher conviction bags um because I think the the way you make the most money in crypto is you stay in the trenches and you're most active with all the new rotations that are happening but you also have your core portfolio that so when crypto is you're like as crypto is going going back up you have that you're already long like you're consistently long so even if you get messed up trying to trade whatever low time frame stuff or like you're wrong on some rotation you buy some altcoin and it goes down like 50% overnight cuz whatever some Rand should happen on chain um you still have your core portfolio you're not like messed up on yeah trade with a cool head that's really interesting I think uh I think the million-dollar question here is are you in your core portfolio for another sort of Pico top parabolic event or do you believe like are are you here because you think that you're preempting another giant bubble or do you believe that we're in this like 20year Mega Trend where crypto slowly starts to eat value transfer as software is eating the world in other areas I think because of because of how small crypto is now even if we you assume on a longer time frame that we're in a slow uptrend the repricing is going to happen quickly uh right now because of how small stuff is like it's going to be a parabolic bubble just because of how how tiny the market is and how how like how easy it is for people to get access to it um so I'm still trading it in that way I still think you're going to have a cycle top and then stuff's going to go down like 70% or so after after that top happens but I do think if we get to like I've been saying like Six Trillion if we get over like Six Trillion as a top for whatever this cycle and then we stay in multi-trillion um like total market cap as a as like as all of crypto I think you're going to see the volatility damping just because we're going to be a bigger market and I think this is one of the last ones um where we're still tiny the Beres has been saying 10 trillion I'm like dude if we get 10 trillion well there's your I don't think sounded the realm of possibility mean the next the next bubble is gonna the the thing is that people have now missed two cycles if they haven't gotten a crypto then there there are a lot of people with a lot of money that if this thing starts ripping again there's there's going to be a tremendous amount of fomo but it remains to be SE when that top is I feel like a good way to we get we we we can we can send this off everybody goes around and gives the exact date of the next top yeah I'm down I'm down all right I I'll go I'll go first I think the exact top is going to be January 21st 2025 uh I'm gonna say March 27 2025 all right I'm gonna I'm going to go a year later than you guys I think it's coming in 26 let's say I think it's march to so March 15 2026 odds of March you heard it here first and the reason why is by then the United States government has just thrown in the the [ __ ] towel on even pretending that they've got an inflation anchor and a a some way to pay back the debt uh they're just they're just going to start printing their way out of this if there's one thing crypto does right for is your portfolio it's that scenario dude that's you're literally giving us two full years of bull Mark I don't know if my body can handle that yeah I can't I was about to say I can't years oh bro I remember I remember um or or the bull market just starts later a year another year of hell and then the of only I don't know I I honestly like you guys are you guys have been in crypto way longer than me so you probably have this this like perception of crypto being this thing that just ramps or or dies or chops around violently and murders people but like I don't know having traded like pretty big asset classes like things don't always work like that like you can have period you can have like like [ __ ] crude oil from 2020 to 2022 just ground up from negative $37 to $120 a barrel like in a straight line right that can happen we we might be in the middle of one of these long ass grindes and and who knows so bro that would be so frightening if Bitcoin just steadily goes up to like 250k can you imagine how many alt Seasons we would have dude they would be so oh my God no I would print bro that would be crazy there'll be a new rotation every three months and Bitcoin just keeps going up no that's that's not even that's rid I I actually think I actually think people would lose their minds that would be Max that would be max pain because every 3 weeks people would be calling top selling everything and then lose all their money like every everybody would be so down in terms of Bitcoin well if that's what if that's max pain then that's what's going to happen yeah like even people are doing it now like the the Bitcoin chart is just like the daily is just up but it's not like ripping up it's just like higher low higher low higher low higher low higher low higher low higher low and everybody's like shaking like panicking like what's why why is it why is it not responding to stuff like going up Bitcoin has the product Market fit Bitcoin is real like every day and more money goes into that thing and the ETF is about to debottleneck some of those pipelines of money I think you see sovereigns AP in uh like El Salvador and Central African Republic just keeps happening and then uh that that's a real use case eth has real use cases salana will probably you know I I I wasn't I wasn't really a believer in salana until I got talked out of my stuper and now it does seem like L1 will probably we'll probably start shoting up some some cool games and dpin and all that that stuff and who knows maybe we end up with this just sort of Vortex of of inflows 2026 2026 would be crazy I'm linear linear growth for the next two years Jonah Jonah Jonah now yeah I didn't call that I said the top is in then may maybe we have a nasty path to that point but I I think get I think we get a steady grind I do I believe it the the reason I think like the reason crypto goes parabolic in the way that it does is because this Market is is full of degenerates dude like the people who trade these markets are willing to all in their net worth on these coins that's why you have these parabas because these like I feel like in other markets I don't know if this is true or not but I feel like in other markets you don't have people yoloing like a very very large percent of their net worth into like random [ __ ] maybe you do maybe retail is starting to do that now just Tesla gme back in the day right but as an asset class for sure I mean I don't know Jan I don't think anybody's just all in and they're not worth into oil at any given moment yeah no I mean like the the market for naasa or gasoline is just not something that your average retail person can trade or would care to trade meanwhile crypto like all all my Trad five friends keep telling me like oh cryp there mostly no coiners they're like oh crypto is going to die after it saps all the money out of everybody's pockets and it's like you mean the entire world and their desire to gamble on a technological future like I no sorry like no it's not gonna happen um and if it does like probably buy Bitcoin it's probably bullish that that uh that um you know dystopian future is probably bullish Bitcoin but I don't want to ramble here this this is about you a so um kind of want to ask you maybe for the screenshot of this podcast can you just move your head to be in the image underneath the crown behind you the basak crown so we can get like a snapshot of you as the king this way yeah there we go all right that's it boom okay we're good let me clarify I said people are like all inting don't all in don't all in one thing please do not please do not do that that's why I said have your core so your core positions and have your DJ um but yeah all ining stuff like I know people who have done it and like spun up whatever 100x 200x but when you don't have risk parameters like that and you continue to trade like oh I'm all in this I'm all in this I'm all in this some somewhere like somewhere along that that path it's gonna wreck you eventually it's gonna wreck you and it and the thing is with crypto is like these markets are up only for months at a time sometimes and when you're long into those up only your confidence only continuously goes up it's like Oh I'm a genius I'm super smart I made this much money in two months I've never made this much money in my life I'm a genius and that confidence will trick you into making trades with no considerations of risk at all um so that that tricks a lot of people towards the end of bull markets is like I made this much I all in this and I all in this and I all in this and then it's like you trip yourself up somewhere because you forgot at the beginning you said I was gonna like take profit back into this I was going to sell at these levels I was going to like TP at this time and you just forget um like Comet yourself up so that's why I say like Journal a ton when you're trading because it's very easy to get lost on a daily basis of what you're thinking was a few weeks prior or a few months prior but if you Journal just open your book turn a couple Pages back oh on March and what November 21st I said this I said I was going to sell when this 5x why am I not trying to sell that now and at 5x like what happened between that period and now like why is my mindset different and it's usually because you're wrapped up in the market um this this is why you're good you have discipline discipline is the number one characteristic of traders who make money consistently over time and then I would say characteristic number two is people who can manage their emotions properly um but discipline definitely number one journaling great Point great way to maintain discipline even the crazy that's CP out and it helps it helps it helps with both you know discipline and emotional management for sure because I I I I've always found the half of emotional management is just reminding yourself that you're feeling something at any given moment yeah when when you're in when you're in the moment and things seem very easy it's just having that reminder to stop and think and that's that's half the battle right there it's just stopping and thinking yep so no for sure that was solid maybe we should get a maybe we should get a reunion of the what was the other pod the Untitled crypto podcast together we get yo yeah we do we need get Kobe back yeah dude where is's in a van somewhere he's probably like traveling the world dude I have no idea he said he was like crypto Twitter is too negative I'm I'm going to do fun things I'm sure that's what he's doing he's still on crypto Twitter probably checking it every day dude honestly I don't know how you do it I G I gave up on crypto Twitter like a year ago at this point dude it's a it's honestly it's pretty bad this year has been pretty bad like the amount of negativity just online this year has been nuts um and I get I get both sides of it because I get people DM me all the time like bro don't pay attention to those guys like you've helped me do this this and this like you made me this much or whatever like you helped me think through this um but yeah the timeline is just hella aggressive when you have a lot of followers on Twitter um this it is a it's a different different experience um it's funny cuz like I tweet the same way I did when I had a thousand followers like I literally tweet I still I go out and I tweet like oh Z's drunk again I was doing that when I had no followers on Twitter my boy my boys would be like Yo dude are you good like what's up and I tweet about crypto stuff you're like oh Z's tweeting about crypto [ __ ] now um but yeah dude it's like when you have a 100K followers somebody's like I don't know has out has it out for you for some reason nobody cares from your account there's somebody that's always going to get mad at you no matter what you yeah like some somebody will take it the wrong way it's a numbers game honestly that's that's how I think about it it's a numbers game like if you if you like tell some you tell five people something probably a low chance that one of those people's gon to get angry at you you tell a 100,000 people something it's a pretty high possibility somebody's gonna have a problem with what you said especially if it's not like consensus um everybody think I'm just don't put your address on your Twitter profile and you're good facts the thing is people recognize me now I walk outside they're like yo anom are you serious like what the [ __ ] whoa no seriously happens in New York do do they call you is it like hey you're the Godfather what's up what's up king or is it or is it more like hey what's what's uh Sho shitcoin gonna do this this week so the dude the first thing what they usually do is they pull up my profile picture and they come up to me and they show it to me like yo are you dude from Twitter I'm like yes yeah sweet um and then they just like start talking to me and then of course at the end they're like okay what's the next coin I should buy what should I buy next without fail without fail oh yeah it's been happening pretty consistently lately like just a random spot in New York I think people in finance G gate keep trading a lot like this oh you have to like the only only successful Trader you have to go to Morgan Stanley and sit on a desk for two years or that's how you learn how to really trade it I don't think that's true at all in any way shape or form this is what I respect about you guys both of you like I I played the game and I went and wore the tie and sat at the desk and did that it didn't like all it all it did was just pre-screen me to join what was ultimately the most ridiculous shitcoin Casino of all time right one thing that's great about crypto is it democratizes those markets and then when there's a crypto crash unlike in crude oil you don't literally ruin entire economies right it's it's gated like the the impact is limited but there's also a positive to it too which is uh that it can create wealth and it can also create an alternative to some of these rigged um trafi systems that uh are controlled by suspicious people so I like that yeah and and and my cope is that it's actually taught a generation of individuals the power of second order thinking like you know because you actually have to you know if you want to be successful I mean there's so many people now that like okay how do I play this game how do I think about this how do I how do how do I get better at this what's the monetary incentive get better at this I mean people are people are uh I think actually having to put some brain power into this which is which is probably a good thing it's important I I think it's also like teaching um like Finance Wise It's not like in crypto obviously the risks are much higher but like once you have that like I think the the process of managing your own money is going to shift way way way more back to the individual than away from like pushing that on other people to do it for you in like the these next few years like this next decade one is because people are going to be forced to it's like okay how do I be more efficient with like scaling up my savings um and then the other reason is I just think we're kind of Shifting away from the trust in these like big corporate institutions back to like the individual um just like in in a way I think that's that's happening across different markets in different ways you can see it a little bit with like how marketing works now there's a ton of marketing directly to these content creators these people who have a ton of followers online do much much better with marketing than these big companies do with their regular um advertisements it's like individual I think is a big big narrative ship it's kind of happening I I couldn't I couldn't agree with you more um and I think that I think you're right managing your own money teaches you risk management Tech techniques much more than just like offloading your your dough to some Robo manager will ever do so yeah I think crypto's financially educating a generation and it's you know it's impressive for me having you know having the opportunity to talk to you andam about what you're doing when I was your age I had you know years of white shoe banking experience but I was a [ __ ] horrendous Trader in hindsight because manage my own money meanwhile like your Miles Ahead your discipline your journaling like these are things I learned to do in my 30s it's a well that thank you man I appreciate crypto forces you to grow up fast because basically what happens is you just lose all your money and then either you learn facts you get wrecked you get wrecked a few times you're like [ __ ] how do I keep how do I stop getting wrecked how do I stop this from happening dude thanks for coming on thank you yeah thanks for having me man I appreciate it fun gotta get Kobe on next dude yeah that that would be an interesting one like calling in calling in using starlink like oh man he's like in he's like actually in space like are you in the is why are you floating all right dude um well we got we got an hour to prep we'll get back to the markets thank you all uh you know for listening this is one of the longer thousand X podcasts so his action pack though so hope you long for a reason yeah not Bor thank you so much an see I'll be great talking to you as always [Music] cool

the market structure has shifted and people are clearly still allocating to bitcoin there's clearly still a lot of cash on the sidelines and then you have I've said this many times you have rate Cuts coming in my opinion in the next in the next 3 to four months you have the having coming you have the ETF coming and now this is what's at the Forefront of everyone's [Music] mind all right welcome back to another episode of a THX our first episode since interviewing Anatoli which was by the way a phenomenal episode I learned a ton and I think most of the points that Jonah brought up against anatol and salana and his abuse of the salana ecosystem uh anoli did a very good job dispelling all of those horrific lies that Jonah decided to tell so you know I definitely enjoyed it I think the the listeners seem to seem to enjoy it I don't know Jonah what what did you think yeah I mean we we got to debrief on that we we didn't really debrief in the previous episode we we spent an hour and a half with Anatoli just learning about salana I mean here's what here's what I learned that kind of changed my mind about that chain so I had previously thought about crypto as an Institutional settlement solution for you know like a database for big important trades and eth does just fine there um there's a lot of tvl on eth and everything an it toally made me realize that centralized solutions for microtransactions like payments or a few other types of smaller transactions like you know whatever's running render And Hive mapper and helium like that that's probably better off in a decentralized world as well I just didn't I that didn't factor into my thinking before and so why should all of that run on an eel too like I'm I'm not a maximalist I I I don't have any religion when it comes to trading so I guess I think that he convinced me that salana is as good as any solution for lower value transactions which need to be fast and not not require tons of gas fees um less convincing so I I think that's a massive use case and if salana can pull that off it's going to be even more valuable than it than it has become recently um where I was less convinced or where I just I felt like maybe I missed something or didn't understand as well was when he was explaining um some of the the fire dancer stuff I like I get that it's good to have a validator client that's laser fast but I still I'm I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the fact that it's developed by one centralized Trading Company like we decentralization matters in crypto and if everyone's running validator clients built by jump like the guy there's got to be something in it for them other than altruism to build a happier more Equitable Marketplace like I I'm I'm a little bit nervous about that and he didn't really explain it but he he [ __ ] crushed every other every other argument I had against salana and you know he he really changed my mind on it what did you think Obby yeah I mean I I kind of I agree with you I want to dig into that point a little bit I don't know much it matters that jump is building is building fired answer because here here are the facts it's going to be open source software and so everybody once it's live once it's out there once it's known everybody's going to know how it works and so jump is probably building it if I were to take a wild guess because I have some sort of good relationship with salana they might even be getting paid on the back end I don't know I don't think it matters uh as long as jump can't Co-op the system because they've built the framework then it's just a large company contributing to open source software which happens all the time in web 2 all the time you have large companies that contribute to open source software as just part of business you have engineers at Facebook at Google at at Apple that continuously contribute to open open source software not necessarily because uh you know they they have derive any immediate direct benefit from contributing to that software but because they use the software they find it useful and good and they want to improve it and they want to make it better because there are certain things that they need uh out of their systems that they're not currently getting and they view the best way of getting those needs is to just build it themselves yeah like meta building llama that's a good right it becomes it becomes a it becomes a public good as long as it's open source so as long as you have that aspect I I actually don't necessarily view that as a negative I I view it as potentially a positive because jump can bring in other people and so while I agree there's probably something going on behind the scenes there I I actually don't really care to find out uh what I care about is does it actually improve the experience of validating Sal does it does it deliver all of the benefits that Anatoli said that it will deliver and I think the answer is very likely to be yes and so now you have finally a monolithic L1 that is useful that doesn't that doesn't go down that is that is fast and you have this embedded system where you can basically build whatever you want and your application will run smoothly and so having that effective database underlying what could be the whole internet in the future is pretty bullish now with all of that said uh one thing that stood out to me was he didn't really have an answer for what should the value value of salana be in the future and I tried to press him on this I tried to ask okay well let's say that salana is the one crypto platform that survives in 20 years the only thing that people touch is salana if there's no mechanism to deliver value back to the salon token itself then does that Salon token deserve a high valuation uh especially if we keep outpacing Innovation on the scalability side it let's say you moved over every single transaction that could have ever possibly occurred in the world onto salana fees might still look quite low and so and in fact they should look low still and so you you might yes you you you have a broader base of transactions that are going through that are delivering Revenue but if scalability outpaces the growth of transactions then you end up with a token that probably isn't worth much in in 10 in 10 15 years now with all that said what are we're Traders at the end like you know me and you we trade uh and a lot of people in the market trade and salana has been a phenomenal bet since uh you know you first said that it was [ __ ] and and I think that's that that's actually I I see this over and over especially in bare markets the most hated assets actually do the best and the reason is because hated assets generate an emotional reaction yeah These Guys these devs they're pouring their livelihoods into this chain even though it's kind it was on its knees for a while earlier this year they get upset when you go and tell them that they're pouring their livelihoods into a doomed you know vaporware product right and that that came out when I tweeted against it maybe we should just like [ __ ] post against polka dot and near and tezos and just see like I don't think people would care cardano that's and that's the difference I think even the cardano people have given up at this point like like [ __ ] post about anything that you want salana generates that that reaction it reminds me a lot of eth in 2019 2020 and so look I think salana was a lot of people's first amazing trade in their lives like yeah uh a lot of Sam got a lot of people like the only tradeit that Sam made that probably made money yeah maybe a lot of people got into crypto because of that and they're still here I think I think that's accurate I also think that am I going to sell every little last bit of salana that I own if salana hits 250 100% no question I'm yeah that's just that that's just the way that it works because I I view this as a phenomenal trade I think that the usage of salana the cult of salana is only going to grow and I think that real interesting applications are going to be built on salana but the reality is at the the end of the day this is crypto and I think the the application layer is where most of the value is going to end up occurring anyway one thing that uh Anatoli said that actually did stick with me is when you look at uh when you look at web 2 the actual amount of applications that have generated usage is smaller than the infrastructure layer uh not in terms of market cap but in terms of amount of different things that exist right and I I viewed that as actually a very strong point right like you think of like okay Facebook Instagram WhatsApp those are all meta Google uh a lot Gmail a lot of these applications uh there actually not that many in The Grand in in the grand scheme of things and so you might see the same thing happen with crypto I mean his argument was that you would see a very similar thing happen with crypto where it's going to be a few select group of applications that get extremely large that are extremely valuable and that drive most of the economic activity on crypto and that's actually okay the question is which what are they going to be and and what is it going to look like in in in five in five 10 years I do think one slight difference is that uh a lot of every you know basically everything in crypto is open source so it's a lot easier to compete with these products because you can just Fork it tweak it improve it and launch and launch you see a lot of copy pasting going on in web too as well you know Snapchat became successful and Instagram launch stories or whatever the [ __ ] I don't know I'm not on either of those apps too old but I think you bring up a really good point about the the applications that cause home runs and it this also ties back into salana and my my original thinking on salana which is like look at the applications on salana this is you know Circa 9 10 months ago it's like you have stepin right which is a walking app that crashes the entire chain and then you have a bunch of um ethereum defi ecosystem clones and a bunch of nft projects that are like trying to achieve you have like the pixelated um seagull things that look kind of like pixelated crypto punks but knockoffs and I was just like okay this chain is filled with applications that are not that useful and the one Innovative one of the walking app kind of like took down the whole thing salana has not fulfilled its promise it's vaporware and I I was too quick to write it off what what I should have realized at the time especially when it was trading $8 token to My Own Credit I didn't sell there but but I should have been buying and the reason why I didn't was because I was like look at this thing it's it's [ __ ] broken and it's not fulfilling its promise uh no reason to pay attention to it chains and this is good a good lesson for Traders out there like chains can turn it around Anatoli talked to us last week about how he fixed that flaw that caused stepping to take down the chain um and they're attracting new applications now like fine maybe ethereum has more tvl on defi because it's a settlement layer for high value transactions but things like helium And Hive mapper flocking to salana and those are the next apps right so so you know just because something's getting you know getting beaten up doesn't necessarily mean that it's it's gone it's going to zero uh Trends can reverse uh the these devs who are super committed in one EOS system or another they can turn it around and so I guess the big question for for crypto Traders out there is what's next right salana started the year at eight bucks it ripped up to 42 it's insane returns right huge trade what's going to pop next uh you know like we mentioned near polka dot and cardano earlier like are any of those things com coming out of the gutter what do you think gby so here's one thing that's happened with salana that I think extends and this is how I'm thinking about the market and how I'm position positioning right now is that there were many people that actually had a very bullish view on salana that weren't positioned for it because they saw the supply issue of Galaxy uh selling selling a bunch of salana the FTX estate right go going through them and they knew that they wanted to buy but they weren't exactly sure when to buy they knew they had a two to threee thesis on this but they wanted to wait for a better price then the market rips and it turns out that the supply is being absorbed really nicely and there there are actually a lot of other buyers in the market that these people are going to are going to be competing with and so something in the market has shifted Jonah we're seeing for the first time Supply actually go the opposite way that the amount of Supply there is to sell even if it's telegraphed is less than the amount waiting on the sidelines that wants that wants to buy and so what this has done is it's created a psychological shift in the market Market where people are now looking to good products that are delivering a good experience that may have been written off that people were waiting on the sidelines for the market to get hot again now people are coming back in and they're saying wait a second maybe I should be buying this stuff all just a few examples of this blur great example uh it's a great product it's used it was hated by the NFD Community for in my opinion fugazi reasons oh yeah it's tanking that it's it's not it's not tanking the nft price price Flor if people wanted to buy it no it's causing efficiency that's what it's it's it's causing yes yes you can get paid to list assets below to trade but what you know if if people wanted to buy it at that price they they can go buy it at that price right if if they view it as a good I wish blur would tank the fza so I could buy some so so what do I what what am I seeing okay blur's now up a ton since since since the lows because people realize it's a good product if you like nfts if you like the direction of the market over the next five years three years one year then you should probably own some and a lot of people didn't because of the airdrop that's coming uh because of the supply issues and I think people are starting to realize I can't just wait I just have to buy at good value at a good valuation that I think at some point in the next year or two years it's going to trade far above that I'm seeing the same thing happen uh we're seeing the beginning of it happen right now with Crypt punks in my opinion there are a lot of people told themselves when the new cycle comes I'm going to buy crypto punks because crypto punks are going to rip really hard and you're starting to see people position for that now and people are going to get really worried that that's going to get away from them so what this is causing the psychological shift in the market is I need to go buy my cycle bags now otherwise I will be screwed if Bitcoin goes to 50K I'm not going to get I'm not going to get dentry and the on on the flip side it makes people a little bit more comfortable buying them because okay maybe it goes down 20% maybe it goes down 30% but at this stage in the market I'm playing for a 3X I'm playing for a 5x I'm playing for a 10x yes and so yes you know maybe you don't blow your whole load immediately uh but what you do is you start allocating the things that you like long term and that's shift and BTC is by the way doing the same thing so why do I think Bitcoin rall so hard post uh you know you know over over the last month I think there's actually one specific reason and this is when we got really bullish I did not bottom tick we didn't buy 25 26 with size we did buy 28 with size why did we buy 28 with size now take a step back the thing that rocketed Bitcoin up was the fake headline from coin Telegraph about an ETF being launched we both have been talking on this podcast for so long about how that ETF is the Catalyst the hard part was answering the question when does that Catalyst start to kick in the moment the fake ETF headline comes out we trade 30 we ret we retrace down to 28 you have to buy why do you have to buy because everybody in the market looks at that and they go oh my God if the ETF drops tomorrow and we think you know 90% chance it drops by q1 of next year I'm so out of position I'm going to be I'm going to miss the whole thing I have to start allocating now so so it flipped right it it was like a sometimes you need a catalyst to get people to position to break them out of that mentality of I'm just going to wait on the sidelines that tweet funny enough even though it was completely fake that was the Catalyst and so what you're looking for when you're trading the mark a market like this is you're trying to understand the drivers behind allocation and then what could lead to those people allocating if you have a view on this ass class that's positive and so the moment that happens you say you say to yourself well okay that was our catalyst so now we probably get the ECF rally a little bit sooner than expected I was not expecting this at 25k I wasn't expecting it at 26 but the moment at 25k it was easy to just sit there and say it's gonna stay here forever right because there was there was there was no Catalyst there was no Catalyst and the way that I always frame things is that you have with Bitcoin you have two things that get people to allocate momentum and value 25k didn't really feel like value to me in hindsight I think I was wrong uh on that but you also very much so had momentum momentum to the downside once that tweet came out once BTF uh the the ETF tweet came out and BTC trades 30 retraces down the 28 you have momentum on your side and you have a catalyst to start allocating and now we're just in an uptrend we're trading 35k right now we keep adding you know we're we're we're W we're waving it in anytime anytime we get a dip because we we we did you know take off a bit the first time we hit we hit 30 35k so anytime we trade below it's like okay like let's let's wave it in why because the market structure has shifted and people are clearly still allocating Bitcoin there's clearly still a lot of cash on the sidelines and then you have I've said this many times you have rate Cuts coming in my opinion in the next in the next three to four months you have the having coming you have the ETF coming and now this is what's at the Forefront of everyone's mind the the risk to buying Bitcoin is pretty limited here like I think the I I I just don't think you can lose that much money buying Bitcoin at these levels I hate you saying that so much with because why because I'm always wrong no that's not here's the setup here's the setup you have like you said the having I think that interest rates have peaked uh I think there's a an idiosyncratic once every four years fundamental Catalyst meaning less Supply less minor selling can't fight the flows then behind all of that you have an Institutional unlock coming like there are plenty of companies out there that just can't touch spot but can touch an ETF plenty of people as well and so uh all of that like that kind of caps your downside um to me over the long run and and you know you talk about hey do you wait for a dip to buy Bitcoin or do you just AP in at current levels I have a framework for this that I want to share um so at Goldman on the Commodities trading floor this is before computers took over there was a lot of shouting you know I I would be Market making all day screaming I would go home every day with a horse uh voice from just shouting out quotes on options and Futures and one of the things that that sometimes would happen on the trading floor is some you know i' I'd quote a tight market and a client would come in and ask for a penny better on the bid or a penny better on the offer and then they'd trade and the joke on the floor was like oh so and so's being a dick for a tick so there's this big sort of trading truism don't be a dick for a tick don't don't just like try to ask like what's that that extra basis point or Penny really matter to you in the long run for your your trading Horizon and your p&l projection like if it's if that's the difference between you buying and not buying like you probably aren't in this for for you know trying to make a lot of money you're probably just being a dick for a tick trying to scrape pennies here and there and there's some truth to it but at times if you just overpay for everything you'll bleed out right so you have to develop a real framework when do you just cross the spread or get in at levels that are well off the lows and when do you hold off when do you wait for a better price so the framework I developed is what I like to call the bad risk good risk framework basically if you're looking at your your portfolio you have to assess whether you are holding toxic waste or pure gold and you kind of have to be a little bit black and white about it and not holding something can be toxic risk as well like if you're if you're passionate about crypto and you think this that Bitcoin is going to trade a million dollars a token in your lifetime and you're flat Bitcoin that flatness is toxic risk in your portfolio so when it comes to toxic risk you need to get the [ __ ] out of it if you if you are long something that you think is going to zero don't be a dick for a tick just sell it if you're effectively short or flat something that you think is going to rip don't be a dick for a tick go and buy even if it's trading 35,000 and you wish you could have gotten it at 25,000 it may never trade there again right um however uh in the meantime especially with range bound things where you're sort of like trying to assess or tweak exposures that you have that aren't necessarily toxic I think it does pay to be a little bit patient uh and not just get get excited about things at the same time as everybody else is getting excited so I'll just tell you my view on bitcoin and then then I'll I'll stop rambling basically I think that over our lifetimes Obby this is one of the most obvious trades in like in the history of Finance there is a an asset that has been accepted as a store of value and a means of exchange and a basically a global Reserve asset that's already kind of given the genie is out of the bottle there and it's not going back in and the supply is constrained the stock and flow Dynamics are such that only 21 million of these things will ever be minted and so given that that's the case you can't do an oil crude oil thing go and mine more of it like I think this thing is going to go parabolic throughout our lifetimes so I am still buying Bitcoin here for myself like I think I think it's going up a lot and I don't really care uh salana I'm less sure of and so I would not be adding at current levels uh after it just you know five to six acts off the lows um damn that's the most bullish thing you've ever said yeah that's that that that that's a that's a big statement I mean I I I agree I I maybe I'm a little just more tempered in that I think that we can I'm not I'm not holding this for a million uh bucks a token I didn't say that's my view but I mean yeah yeah no it's not C like if you said it you wouldn't you wouldn't be laughed out of a a room like people would listen to your opinion and debate you but it's not like wow this guy's full of [ __ ] you know but even even even $100,000 a token right Peter teal has this amazing amazing framework he was like in technology and let's not forget crypto is tradable technology it is software he says people overestimate the probability of a broken thing working and underestimate the uh the probability of a thing that's already working going up and he's like that's the Arbitrage right he's like yes pick pick like series C companies and buy them yes they've ripped a lot they're up 100x from the seed round but they work they're proven they're going to go up a lot more if something's like struggling along at the seed or series a level don't touch it with a 10- foot pole and so I think now might be a time to lean into the stuff that's actually working in salana might be one of those things if you see apps flocking to it Paul Paul Paul tutor Jones said something basically the exact same in concept which is losers average losers and winners average winners right that's a good one that's you know betting bet that that's why when I look at the market right now I'm buying the winners the other thing that I wanted to I I I wanted to point out is that uh right now the the way that the market is trading it is kind of nice from a technical perspective and so if you want to technically trade BTC Ju Just go on coinalyze uh pull up three things pull up open interest pull up cvd on spot instruments and pull up cvd on Futures instruments and when you see shorting in the market it's been a really just great short-term trade over and over uh so for example we just did a trade um where Bitcoin was heavily shorted it sold off to uh 34600 bought 34600 and then now I guess it's it's 35400 so a portion of that trade will will will come off but you just saw so many shorts come in like 9k BTC worth of worth of shorts come in and those guys have tended to get squeezed at the bot at the bottom of this what I call like an an up accumulation range uh and so that's like a that's been a really interesting short-term trade that that you can take out that's been happening pretty frequently I think it's happened uh three times so far actually four times so far in the last uh in the last two weeks I used to not believe in technicals but then um after spending a little bit more time reviewing that thesis I found that technicals are pretty much all there is to trade on systematically with a Time Horizon of under an hour so if you have a a computer trading for you it's technicals are all you got but then on the longer term things like I still don't really believe you can make money trading uh T taking investment views on technicals however I do believe that you can apply techn technical analysis to what in crypto let's call it fundamental indicators which in crypto means things like glass nodes mvrv metric or C CDD metrics and when those things start to show momentum then you can use that as an input to trade the underlying asset which is Bitcoin or eth and that that actually does work so I would I I I would I would 100% agre agree with that um you know there there were some really interesting uh interesting charts that are that are coming that are coming through recently uh you you you actually you you you actually are starting to see the stable coins um the the decline of stable coin start to level out over the last over the last two three weeks so I think money is money is actually coming into the com coming into the system um and you're also you're you're seeing you're you're seeing froth come back to the altcoin market which sometimes is bad but I remember back in in in 201 in 2021 we had extended periods of high funding for a long time and I wouldn't necessarily call this extended yet but altcoin there are a lot of altcoins out there that have had positive funding for two three weeks now and haven't really pulled back and it's not like egregiously positive funding it's just reasonably positive and oi growth is reasonably good and that actually is an indication that there's especially because Bitcoin is holding the highs that's the key that there actually is new money coming into the system because otherwise what you would expect is you would expect like the danger zone is bitcoin's trading at 34k and alts are Roofing and funding is Roofing what that means is that capital is recycling from Bitcoin to alts but what you have now is you have Bitcoin at the high is an ALT sustaining funding High funding and so that's actually not necessarily as dangerous and I think a lot of people were pointing this out I saw on CT is as a dangerous thing um but it's more dangerous when Bitcoin isn't trading well when Bitcoin is is trading well you can actually have that Dynamic persist and it's an indicative of new money coming in and so the way that I view this market right now is I'm looking for 40 to 45 in the next month uh at which point uh I probably take my exposure down a ton rotate into alts that I think are really uh like prone for a catchup hopefully eth BTC gets nuked at that point still and you can rotate into eth for the eth BTC catchup trade and then you start filtering down you can buy things like optimism arbitrum Lio and then once you get the ETF approval you can sort of say goodbye to the trade for the time being yeah I mean I'm too much of a chicken to rotate out of BTC if it trades 45 like I'm adding here I think that I've been adding for you know very slowly admittedly but for a long time um since 25 I'm still adding now and I've been adding by a gbtc because I think there's convexity there and I think that Bitcoin will trade $70,000 a token before the end of Q3 next year so given that view I'm too scared to sell any BTC to rotate into anything else because I uh I just think yeah sure there might be more reward in Lio but there's I think so much more risk that it doesn't justify that reward i' just rather stick with BTC and and keep keep it keep B chunky that's that's okay you can stay poor it's fine I don't you know it's ngmi or did did that die during the last cycle I'm a Trader man I look for I I I I love these types of catchup trades if you can uh if if you can accurately if you can accurately move I think one one thing that's still true is that there not that many people that are playing the market aggressively right now and so you're seeing a lot of lag uh in in the market sort of across across the board like the eth the eth BTC trade for example that was an ex example of that uh very rarely even if eth BGC looks really bad do you get a such a rip from Bitcoin and no move from eth and I think it just took people a little bit to acclimate to that um even though theoretically eth should be the second most watch asset and so I think you're going to see the same thing down Downstream so overall I think what we can say is that we're extremely bullish on the market there there there there are a lot of there are a lot of really interesting ways interesting ways to play this what I'd advocate is that you just start paying attention to patterns because pattern matching is going to be really important right now and there going to be a lot of really interesting ways to make money as the market heats up just by noticing how the market reacts And Trades to certain scenarios where money flows uh and the tokens that are correlated that might be that might be lagging uh that you can trade for catch-ups uh there's there's there's a lot of really interesting really interesting stuff to do in the markets right now maybe on the next pod uh I can I can detail some of that exactly how to do it I think that that might that might be fun for for our listeners yeah I mean I agree I think uh I I wrote a a Twitter Thread about how to use Twitter as a trading tool and this guy responded to it with I'm pretty this best trolling ever it was uh he he wrote how to draw an owl and then the first step is draw two circles and the second step is draw the rest of the [ __ ] owl um and then it's like a beautifully drawn owl and I kind of think that what you just said Obi deserves a bit of trolling it's like it's like yeah you just do some pattern analysis it's it'll come okay uh fine I I'll be I'll be I'll be more I'll be more concrete for the listeners out there uh download a series of price uh download a series of price data across the top 50 coins that you can trade on Perpetual Futures calculate the rolling correlations on a 30 30day on a 30-day time period uh then calculate the uh the zcore of those of those correlations um and then what you want to do is you actually you actually want to sorry calculate the correlations predicted correlations of those then take all the assets and compare them again compare the prices against each other and then find divergences in those correlations so for example this historically has been correlated at 30 but over uh the last one day over the last three days they've actually diverge significantly in price and the correlation is much lower than you would expect one is one is could totally outperform the other and then bet on the ones with the highest divergences as in but like like play the catchup so let's say that a and compound have a very high price correlation historically and then they diverge because a rips and compound lags then you're supposed to buy compound or sell a or do both like play the pair trade um that kind of thing exactly okay smart so there's okay something concrete so it's not just draw the rest of the [ __ ] L you can go do that very simply I love it uh what else what other what other fun things can you do in this in this in this market environment you could just buy Bitcoin and wait I think you could buy crypto punks I'm getting bullish I think that you know if you if you look on the Block they have a great nft volume tracker um you know nfts are just like ultr levered crypto uh punks and apes the floor is still near the lows that could be an amazing catchup trade uh just buy a floor Punk or or party Dow your way into a floor Punk um or or something like that uh you know I think they're the fact that volumes are picking up in nfts means it's a sentiment indicator it means that people who have been hibernating in this crypto winter are starting to feel a little bit less terrified and that's that's pretty good you know I don't I I don't usually like looking at the fear and greed indicator that gets published occasionally because I think it's too it's either like Max Panic or Max greed like it doesn't give you um yeah doesn't give you longer term signals so I don't use it but I think nft volumes that's a real one to pay attention to and we are picking up off some pretty drastic lows to it's getting interesting quickly there that could be a good one um I think that the like I just I feel bold right now I don't think there's a lot of risk there's just too much Tailwind going on I think what could really smoke crypto if I'm just trying to like think of things that could that could take it out some sort of crazy government default scenario or a massive recession but another reason why feel confident around those geopolitical and macroeconomic uh risks is that the last three to four times we've had serious risk like that like 2008 and Co were were the two big ones then a couple of other ones like 2018 taper tantrum the government just turns on the fire hose of money and and crypto is literally purpose-built to hedge your portfolio against those scenarios so I almost think like bring on the crisis that's a dip to buy uh because of the anticipated response um you know yeah I think I think that's I think that's very accurate uh all all all all I'll say is I'm I'm I'm hopeful that this uh this continues this continues trending trending in our I think this is a really good time for Bitcoin because it's also decorrelated a lot from the broader markets and so you have a lot of strength in BTC when other things are doing poorly and so if people are searching for return especially on the macro trafi side then that starts to look uh start Bitcoin starts to look a lot more interesting here yeah it's crazy like I talk to my friends outside of the crypto market and they look at me like I'm diseased like I've been like I've been waiting through nuclear waste with the last two years of my life meanwhile if you just look at the board look at look at Bitcoin like yeah it was down a lot in 22 but if you didn't invest in it this year you're just making excuses for your underperformance uh at this point like it's stellar and and this isn't like something that most people can't touch you could have you know let's let's just do a Victory lap Obby since January 1 we've been telling people to buy gbtc how much is gbtc up on the year see I think 230% E's up 200 I think by the way still a great trade me too you and you can throw this this stuff in your you know in your Schwab or your Fidelity account it's not like you need to set up cold storage and have people guarding it with guns like it's it's accessible I think what you're trying to say with the beginning of this discussion is that if you listen to everything that we say you make money yeah easy easy just draw the [ __ ] ow you know just draw just draw just draw the [ __ ] l no actually it's funny it's funny because like I view this podcast as a as a chance for us to explain how we think about things but the reality of the situation is that we change our opinions every 30 seconds I don't think we've changed our opinions on being bullish crypto throughout this that well no you know we were you know I was I was bearish I was tactically bearish for a bit I got some calls wrong um you know in aggregate we've had a very good year and I think most of the calls have been pretty good but you know because because you you you you have to you just have to adjust your opinion when information changes right you just have to and and that's I think that's a great lesson for the listeners not just like yeah change your view when when the information changes but also like put your views out there like we're podcasting right now uh 600,000 people looked at this tweet and like half of them when came after me and called me a clown that's good because that then I learn something right like if if you aren't putting your your opinions out out there on the table and just laying it all out in the open on a podcast or on Twitter you're never going to solicit any feedback you're just going to live in your Echo chamber you're going to miss stuff and get stuff wrong that's what trading floors used to be so good for when they were just sort of like open outcry places um you you were just constantly absorbing information and debating things and now a lot of that has migrated online it's on it's on Twitter X or whatever it's on uh it's on Spotify it's here at 1 THX so we're just you know if you think that if you think that we're wrong or you think missing something or you think the gbtc discount is going to widen to 90% like hit us up we'll respond let's talk like let's figure this out together uh maybe we should be rotating out of gbtc and into spot maybe we should just be selling it outright and waiting for a dip to buy maybe we should be like adding not being a dick for a tick because this thing's going to double or more you know we we want to talk about this stuff talking is how you you adapt and improve your process as a Trader I agree so I think uh that's a good that's a good note to end on Jonah with this little nugget of knowledge that you've given to everybody as always I love chatting with you likewise this has been this has been a fun pod it's great we'll have to find somebody even crazier than Anatoli to come on to give us a to give us a schooling next time maybe this time I'll do the drunk tweet and we'll see wasn't that drunk just had had a couple of wine but but it's it's such a good story it's just such a good story dude great to see you as always let's let's try to find some guests if anybody wants to be on the thousand X pod DMS are open we want to talk yes all right take care everyone later till next [Music] time

Transcript Text:
I honestly think that as soon as a stable coin bill passes Congress you will see a massive dramatic shift within like two to 5 years of of like us converting from Current financial systems to Crypt basements everyone knows this technology is better it's easier like all the apis are easier and like we can start actually using this Technologies I think it'll [Music] explode all right welcome to the THX podcast we've got a very special guest for everybody today totally one of the founders of salana and why do we have a guest this week well because Jonah managed to make every single holder of salana extremely irate a few days ago by drunk tweeting in his words why salana is completely [ __ ] and so we wanted to have a conversation here to figure out is that true is salana completely [ __ ] but first I kind of want to figure out jono where did that tweet come from yeah so first of all toally thank you for being such a mature good Steward of your ecosystem and responding to me in you know technical thoughtful ways you know uh thank you for coming on the podcast to discuss let me give you a little bit of an apologetic background so I was on vacation with my wife in Rome the kids were somewhere else you know with their grandparents yeah I had one of those those sort of nights that you you really don't get a lot when you're a parent so you know had a nice bottle of wine feeling pretty happy about myself and that you know my 24 hours of Freedom now my wife's pretty sick of listening to me talk about crypto so after she passed out I was like you know what I don't know if salana is gonna perform as well as e will in the next year let me talk to the internet about that and you don't no one cares what you say on the internet if you're not a little bit extreme so I could have said hey sa e is gonna underperform a little bit if these things happen but instead I kind of went for it I I went aggressive fell asleep I wake up and now literally everyone who still cares about crypto wants to [ __ ] kill me uh so for everybody out there if you want to make people mad suggest that salana is in trouble H man I I am a dad myself and I wouldn't spend 24 hours free without from the kids thinking about Krypto uh I was you something else yeah but uh I I appreciate that I was you know like you know that you had time to think about salana um first of all I hope like everyone that's listening can be like mature about these things it's just the internet people should post if you ever actually meet those folks even the worst [ __ ] posters in crypto Twitter if you meet him they're all nice people that you would totally be normally friends with and like grab beers or whatever that's your thing so like I hope people can step back whenever they get like too emotional into in these discussions and just like this is just literally people arguing about software uh and I'm I'm not even guy I have no business arguing about software like I can write some crappy Python and I think the most technical thing I ever did was write the electronic music for this podcast but let me let me ask you a very simple question for non-technical folks out there about salana what what is the in a world where there's probably a little bit too much block space relative to the demand for crypto use cases right now what um what what's sort of the vision behind creating the world's fastest cheapest blockchain like what what use cases are you targeting this um there's this like this is like a really good question because we don't know like at what point is the market saturated with block space are there use cases that are like unlocked at Subs transactions that are worthwhile for anyone there might be there might not there's some indication of that you look at like iot stuff like helium And Hive mapper it would be really really tough to do it on any other environment unless it's completely centralized running on a database you kind of need like something like salana for those um but could the world create those services in a completely centralized Manner and be fine and nobody and like life goes on right like that that's like another question but like I think there is this like General belief similar to people building open source software in the 90s that like I think if we build these systems in the decentralized Iz way they'll create more value in the long term for everyone else just like you could argue Windows as better features as good as Linux yada yada yada but like for some reason in the 90s I was motivated to spend my weekends working on open source software because I thought that it would be like a major benefit to myself as an engineer and to like the greater public and to all the other Engineers I work with so there's something to that I think similarly like if we can build decentralized systems the hope is that they're less likely to get co-opted and turned into like the shitty version of the web that we have today like if Facebook was decentralized if Google was decentralized if all these like things were decentralized from the start they might not suck as much right like you might not have your data stolen all the time and sold and like there's a bunch of benefits that come from that like diffusion of power and like robustness and reliability and like that's the Hope right and like every person has the option to go work at like everyone in crypto that's like building stuff they're solving real hard engineering problems they all have the option to go work at Facebook Google Netflix Microsoft earn close to million dollars a year and just not give a [ __ ] for some reason they're choosing to do this some may choose it for the upside but a lot of people are choosing it because it's more fun like you actually feel like you're fighting the David versus Goliath battle right like you get to like push the hard technology forward it's just more enjoyable for like a life career goal to do that than to go like work in a giant Java database to optimize ads for Google even though probably you'd make more money and have better work life balance and your kids spend more time with the kids right like but like we're here right like we're trying to do something interesting so in that sense like there's like a lot of faith in that like if we build the system and what what am what am I good at I'm good at making things like hyper optimized and like efficient if I apply all my talents into this and like make a really hyper efficient low latency cheapest cause blockchain I think it'll open up new use cases and could be very disruptive and that's cool I don't know what it's going to be worth right like if if salana is worth like one/ tenth of what it is today we just have smaller validators and features would take longer to ship because there'd be fewer core developers but there still be people that are like holy [ __ ] this is fun to work on I'm gonna keep going at it that's the only difference right like I the rest is kind of like up to the the gods you know like I pmf is really really hard to find really hard to predict so what happens is is really really tough to know like in the future that's actually something that I wanted to ask about is that that last little part there is it important to you to build in ways to generate value for salana it's like with eth right they basically made the decision we're going to introduce EIP 1559 specifically so that eth could derve more value from activity on the chain is that something that you view is important all all proof of stake notw Works no matter how the tokens move inside the Black Box all derive value the exact same way there is a resource that people want and if people want it enough in a short enough time they will try to access it and no M whether you have a burn or not it doesn't really matter because even without the burn people bid up the fees validators earn more rewards that means that owning eth to get more stake to be a block producer more often earns higher rewards it's the same Loop doesn't matter if it's burned or not it's a nice meme to have it the deflationary meme and that's cool but 1559 exists for a more technical reason it's to prevot spam attacks in The Ledger doesn't really matter like if you if you took away that technical reason the value AC cruel to the ethereum network is exactly the same it's from like people demanding access to block space and like bidding for it just to such to such Heights that it's significant um now that's harder for that to occur in salana because we have localized Fem markets and that's slowly happening in ethereum because l2s are separating State and each L2 has its own fee markets so you can think of hl2 it's kind of this generic blob that has its own fees those fees now don't really ACR to ethereum outside of like the L2 data fees so like you're already seeing kind of this happening in ethereum um and a qu the question that every everyone should have in their mind some point I don't know when ather will also fix its block space problem and its block space is going to be much much higher probably to the point that the fees to access the data itself just submitting bytes to the network are kind of commoditized there should be like no more than like you know 2 3x the cost of the hardware maybe 5x but like a small multiple of the cost of the hardware Hardware is really cheap like really really cheap it's interesting because I remember uh you know in the early days of on a the hardware to run a validator was super expensive right like what would it cost what was the cost of one box yeah when we started it was about 1200 1100 a month then it dropped to 800 now it's about 35 uh 350 my guess is within a year probably sub 200 a month um what so let's say that fire dancer ships and it's a big success what what will it cost to run a run a validator yeah fire dancer is far more efficient than the lab's client so we'll see like what it actually how it actually performs the the problem is that like you're also like when you get like a box at a data center you're paying for the machine the cores the memory and the bandwidth and the electricity and like the cost of the cores and that kind of stuff where efficiency of the code has the highest impact is like one quarter of the overall cost right so like fire dancer could be like 10 times more efficient the price of that box drops by like 20% right that's it right like so so you get like you get some benefits but not all the benefits so you need like it's like a amell's law kind of problem when you have like a bunch of things to optimize you make one the cost of one zero the other things become the dominant factors and you don't see like the same Improvement across the overall thing right um the I it would be really awesome to see see once fire dancers out uh what kind of performance they could get on the same hardware and I suspect it's going to be much much better but we'll see um so what I'm excited about like fire dancer coming out is obviously safety we have two clients most of the top validators that are of a lot of stake the hardware costs of them are insignificant uh they should be running both clients at the same time and like one primary one secondary so if there's a bug in one they fail over to the other one that's a massive Improvement reliability if they diverge on state they halt that means there's a like a systemwide bug hopefully that never happens but that's like I will be able to sleep at night because we go from like catastrophic safety bugs being like a potential like death of the network to just being a liveness issue most suck but those are recover recoverable from um again hopefully never happens but like that's that's a massive massive Improvement and like once you have two clients it's easier to build a third and a fourth and there's already a team working on the third one very quickly um you know this fire dancer is being built by a Trading Company it's being built by jump I've never worked at jump but you know I've worked at Goldman I've worked at Vall I've worked at drw like I I know that trading companies are not altruistic entities and I know how they operate they're pretty Machiavellian so how let's say that fire dancer is a huge technical success and it decreases the cost of block space and everything that you just mentioned Works smoothly and suddenly you know machines all over the world are running fire dancer and it's it's the go-to validator client for Sal salana how should users feel about the fact that the goto software validating blocks is you know control or invented by a company that's clearly got some incentive right uh to to build this they're not doing it for free yeah so this is what's cool the trading companies are actually like are mutually aligned with the idea of a giant transparent State machine that would be competing with centralized exchanges so when you like right now connect to NASDAQ to get like high performance connection you got to pay them an arm andal leg every trade and everything you submit like you you can keep track of your data but they keep all the data and then they charge you to to get the data back so you pay them an armor like to connect you pay them an armor elect to read the data and it's available only to like the top Traders and to to be part of that Network it's very expensive and it's not it's opaque it's transparent to them this is an open system run by volunteers that means that like anyone in the world that pays for hunk of metal can go and connect and be in the same Level Playing Field that's jump and to them that's great they just have more competition that they get to compete in an open environment their connectivity is free right it's the hunk of metal the data is available to everyone they get to like grind out a profit based on their like algorithms and and like knowhow and stuff like that without this additional man in the middle this NASDAQ or naisy that's taking a rake that's a huge win for every Trading Company so in a lot of ways like this was doing this volume to the network basically they're they're doing this the vision is aligned with with removing a man an extractive manal in finance which is like the centralized entities that run markets it'd be better if they were all decentralized markets because that's an open space where they're competing without paying these like astronomical fees to like what value does does like an exchange provide it's just a bunch of boxes somewhere that the you connect to right that's it like why do they get to make so much money for running a market like you got to ask yourself that yeah I mean exchanges are are very valuable businesses they don't take any risk and ex like jump actually takes capital and risks it right they like try to synthesize all all of the world's information and predict the future that's really really hard and exchange doesn't do that they just run a market and say here I'm gonna take a trade from you and a trade from you and I'm gonna take a cut in the middle you guys do all the work I get paid right like the this is like if this works right if we can get a decentralized system to be basically like Bound by physics like we remove all the bottlenecks and salana is now like globally distributed information's propagating it at the speed of light it would there would be no Arbitrage between the state on salana and state on NASDAQ like that's a really really cool outcome so like that's that's the dream that's the goal I think that's a line with John because it will literally cut cost for them like over the long term it's like Google investing in Linux because they see Microsoft making a shitload on Windows and being like if we invest in Linux it's a free OS it might take a Chun out of this like big competitor that's kind of extracting a lot of value from us so I know this is like a this is like a big narrative in in in 2021 was salana as the basis for a lot of financial transactions and for the pl places that an exchange could go build that defi that defi might get really really huge on and then you get the financial system rebuilt on salana I think realistically post the FTX implosion because FTX was a big supporter of that narrative that sort of died a bit and on salana you started to see activity on nfts and gaming and people were starting to pay attention oh well maybe it's not going to be you know used for for that but it's going to be used for at the nfts were were blowing up at the time so my my my question to you is uh on the financial side what has happened over the last year or 18 months that people might not be paying attention to that is proving out that you're getting closer to everything that you just described because obviously there were a lot of roadblocks there I think like the hardest part has been like grinding for tvl and volume those are really really tough businesses to run like one is one we we're like I'm heads down optimizing the network but there's like startups like Phoenix like margin fi like drift Zeta Etc that are like running these like systems that are doing all sorts of trading environments running markets and are grinding for pmf and competing across the board right in the bare Market with everyone else for Traders and stuff and they're slowly growing you see like Phoenix Phoenix I don't know if you guys look at Ellipsis the central IM r book that was built by a couple Engineers like over the last six months their volume to tvl ratio is like 30 times higher than Unis swaps it's just insane how efficient they are and this is because it's a highly optimized Central OTE order book like the compute costs on it are like way way more faster even than serum and like the the old school Central liit order book it's easier to use for devs and they've done like a meticulous job optimizing that they just like they've been doing a really like really amazing job but the volumes are still small like we're talking like one to five million uh per day so these are tiny things but are like not zero right like that are that are growing it's really tough to compete with ethereum there because the way that ethereum def5 works is that people deposit a bunch of tokens that they don't want to sell that they kind of have a very long position on and collect yield on them and they just kind of sit there they're not very Capital they're not optimizing for Capital efficiency they're just optimizing for longterm preservation of like that exposure right to that to that coin or that or that thing so if you're like a big a holder you don't really care like how much it costs for for how much your Capital could be gaining somewhere else right because you're not going to sell your tokens you're just going to keep them you're going to deposit them in that protocol you're to keep them there and get whatever yield you can get because you're like maximally align with that and ethereum being first and kind of leading defi summer and generating so much like market cap across the board there is really really tough to compete just like a a oneclick you should move your tvl from an A to a to an equivalent on salana I always wondered why more people don't go down that path and trying to you make it just really really really easy to Port over activity yeah I think like Jupiter actually is working on some of that like uh on working on like bringing like Bridges and and stuff like that that are instant on demand Bridge liquidity that you don't have to worry about like where it's coming from you just kind of Click one button um yeah people are like the pieces are there people are starting to realize that's a way to attract users and then grow their business and they're adding those user like uh ux improvements everyone is fighting for this like all the l2s ETC right like everyone is trying to find like what is a product that I can build to attract Traders which is kind of a fixed number right now because it's maybe we're not in the bare Market anymore but like we are not really in a full Market either right we might be Shifting the winds are shifting potentially but like that's a zero sum game where everyone's pvping each other for that like activity we get a bad rep toally no one wants to be like us yeah it's not an attractive space but I I hear you on the on the attracting tvl and attracting flow thing I mean and I go back and forth on this my sort of geopolitical view on crypto is that in its current form crypto is a fantastic solution for emerging markets it provides dollarized you know checking accounts banking uh you can earn yield on your dollars if you live in a place like Argentina or Iran or Venezuela you can you know you can effectively have a US Dollar Bank account um however I think a lot of the developer activity in the west you know at The Cutting Edge is focused on applications that aren't necessarily needed in the west so I think it would be kind of an interesting interesting thought exercise for people building Financial applications on a chain like salana to you know think about how could I just create basic defi Primitives that are beautiful and easy to use for people who actually need them I'm not sure the market is ready for like a an a Central limit order book for options trading yeah I honestly think that as soon as a stable coin bill passes Congress you will see a massive dramatic shift within like two to five years of of like us converting from curent Financial systems to Crypt based ons like I I think there is just a massive regulatory roadblock right now everyone knows this technolog is better it's easier like all the apis are easier I don't if you've ever been a Dev tried to like connect to PayPal or stripe it's like a pound of Flesh in a firstborn to like deal with with the mess of setting up like Merchant like it's much easier but like it still sucks compared to like I just generate an address with a private key and I'm good to go right like that's it well what what technical perspective is is that is it a technical issue or is it that they don't want to make it easy uh the network the way that the US Financial systems work are all around these like compliance silos like around AML and stuff and like credit cards are kind of like the way that you interact with users but credit cards themselves are are bizarre like when I do a credit card transaction it's equivalent to me sharing my private key with the merchant yeah and then and then there's like this massive process to like figure out if the merchant did a like some stole the private key in the process and did an invalid transaction it's bizarre right like if you step back yeah you step back for a second and be like what who would built this so like uh there's a lot of problems with how the stuff works right now in the US and it's all based on like kyc AML silos if and when we get a stable coin Bill and like we can start actually using ITS Technologies I think it'll explode you'll have like your bank accounts will take usdc deposits across a bunch of networks like just like exchanges do and like people will like kind of forget about wires and all this other stuff so what are you doing to make sure that stable coin activity occurs on salana and why do salana better than ethereum for stable coin usage um well it's cheaper and faster and there's some use cases where that matters like check out uo especially like coffee shop s like settlement where you're like waiting in a line behind people you really don't want to wait 20 seconds right like for stuff to to clear fees are also kind of a suck like if it's a bad out like it for the middle class in United States they're not going to care about extra 20 30 cents or a dollar but like if you're talking about an aggregate it's a really bad outcome to shift to a technology that is an aggregate more expensive for finance because this touches everyone in the US and like it's a regressive tax it's just like like not everything about like technology is like supposed to reduce costs make stuff more efficient right and better so like I don't see Congress being super supportive of something that increases Financial costs uh like for the majority of Americans like something in Salon definitely will decrease it right you can do like H you can do like a trade on on Jupiter that'll multiroute a trade for like five cent trade because they can touch 50 different markets and find you the most liquidity across a bunch of markets for five cents without incurring any additional fees that's actually a really good response to an sort of a criticism I had in my [ __ ] post which is sort of like you know Finance settles T plus2 so high value Wall Street transaction settled T plus2 so I've kind of always thought who gives a [ __ ] whether it settles in 13 seconds or you know 400 milliseconds it's still just a massive Improvement you're saying for low value transactions it batters massive right I didn't think of it that way credit card checkout has to be done under two and a half seconds and the fees have to be cheap enough to where like it's cheaper than it's like comparable to V Visa's like internal infra cost of all their databases and stuff to where like if they switch their infra to this they're bottom line does not get impacted right like because they're a profit driven company they're never going to do it if their costs go up by 10 they will get skewed by every Democrat out there if the user if the human costs go up like to to their consumers go up by a factor a 10 like there's no way that would fly and like that's a bad outcome like everyone should kind of intuitively agree that like Finance is moving numbers around computers it's a regressive tax in the entire economy it should be as cheap as possible like it that's a win for for like the entire world if we reduce those costs I mean I think I think Vis also just sees the writing on the wall that that business model is going to be very tough they aesome yeah the providing credit and underwriting risk and stuff like that that's real value you got to do work you got to figure out like how to manage that that's awesome like I I hope they thrive and like create like massive success for everyone and like have like an awesome way for me to get credit usdc right when I need it in like a very simple way out of my wallet and and that would be awesome so like I I hope they they crush it and uh but like we need we need the stuff to actually be for this stuff to go mainstream it's really really hard for it to happen in the US until there is some some actual stable coin legislation it's coming they'll do everything else uh before they do the right thing but eventually they'll do the right thing so you're playing the long game here and I think I heard on another podcast that you're talking to Visa a little bit um yeah the found the foundation uh has worked with them Visa did a bunch of research across a bunch of different blockchains and um they like Solana's performance and costs as comparable to their infra costs and like they are exploring basically I think launching a whole crossb remittance program using usdc on salon and remittance is like an obvious win where you're like competing with like Swift fees and a whole bunch other [ __ ] with like 50 different banks to hop between like any two points versus using usdc it's just like such a direct win that it's it's it's so obvious that everything should run on crypto for for like crossb stuff that um it's feels like from their perspective that it's such a better technology that they can actually like gain market share and like prove this out as like a a win right like for for the company that that's really really cool um it's still like I think people need to be like cautiously optimistic we need to see these big companies get like at least like two to 3% of their revenue coming from crypto activity like a legitimate US Financial company that's not crypto native so not talking with coinbase but like anyone PayPal or whatever Visa wants to get like a few percentages of their revenue coming from crypto activity that means that the shareholders are going to care right the boards are going to care they're going to start investing more into it and like that's the snowball that's actually going to get us to like mainstream ad option it doesn't we don't have to get like 20% right out of the bat but like just a few percentage points is is significant so the road to those few percentage points I think you know you as a as the core engineer of salana and and the you know Traders and investors who are long salana tokens have very aligned incentives right because the worst case scenario is the same for for both the Traders and the devs which is a network outage in the middle of this or a severe Network outage in the middle of of this you know period of sunlight and progress so the stuff that keeps you up at night is probably the same thing that keeps you you know Salon token holders up at night which is what what's going to happen the next time the network gets pulled over if ever uh so how do you feel about you know last year's issue being in the review mayor do you feel confident is is fired dancer part of that like what what what what makes you confident that the future is going to look better than the past well like the past issues were all centered around like basically one uh design decision that we uh just didn't think hard enough on but obvious in retrospect uh when we launch and this is to do with hotspots and like kind of those like kind of very large demand spikes um for folks that don't know basically salana is a parallel virtual machine called svm it runs stuff in parallel it's very very cool it's it's to be knes uh so it can do many things at once but there's other parts of the system that don't do everything at once and you can think of one part of that system is like when you get a bunch of transactions and you decide what to run in parallel like the block producer the leader like they in salana there's no mempo so the block producer gets as many connections from different clients and just receives a shitload of transactions and then tries to find the best parallel ones to run in svm well before we had priority fees and this like idea of localized fee markets when there was a hot nft mint um boders would like create as many machines as they could around the internet and they would all submit transactions trying to be first to be in that NF Min so many that it would like exceed the physical limits of what these machines could process sometimes like hitting like 20 40 gigabits per second of data um so we had to fix that problem which was switching to Quick which is a a Google internet St an internet standard buil by Google designed for this kind of low latency communication but with ability to do flow control so that works out the second part is that like even if you switch to quick and you get a bunch of transactions you don't want botherers to create a shitload of machines and then just all be the only one submitting data because you're still dealing with a big pilot connections so then we had this idea to do quality of service where if you have some stake you're guaranteed certain amount of traffic if you don't have any stake you have a best effort on every machine that has stake to take some of their bandwidth right and and and give it to non-st nodes so if you have like an entire network of two 2200 Salon validators each one of them allocates 10% of their bandwidth to non-state nodes you would have to attack all of them at the same time to to prevent any non-state transactions from going through right so that that's a cool solution and then once you get all this data you got to sort it and this is where the localized fee markets come in where the way that svm works the way it creates parallelism is that developers have to work a little harder in Solano they have to tell the network which parts of the state they're going to read which parts of the state they're going to write you can think of these states as like buckets and when you start creating transactions you take them take the most expensive ones and you start filling up buckets based on the state they touch and as soon as one bucket is full you you basically delay all the transactions that touch that bucket and you fill up and you continue pulling the highest expensive ones as long as it doesn't touch that Full Bucket right does that make sense okay you can kind of visual it visualize this right every transaction has a bunch of stuff in it you put the stuff in buckets as soon as one is full of shoes or whatever you can't take any more transactions with shoes the shoe is full how do you decide how like when something is full what do what does full mean in that context this comes from uh like even if you have parallelism when something all wants to Mint the same nft they're all touching the same state and you cannot parallelize that there's nothing you can do no zero knowledge magic no L2 it's called a database hotspot everybody wants the exact same thing uh there's no solution to this so you can the only thing you can do is you can limit it so there is only certain amount of like transactions that can touch the same state in a block that can that can be scheduled but a block can have many multiples of these so you can have like five different hotspots or whatever or four so if there's a Hotpot like a hot nft mint you fill up that hotspot first with the highest paying transactions that all want to touch that nft mint and then you're done anything else that's wants that nft mint is delayed yes sir I guess um my question was a little bit more of and this is just out of pure curiosity is that concept of full orchestrated by the chain or the validators yeah it's yep it's it's yeah it's it's it's basically defined by the block so you can think of it as part of like evm gas limits we have like uh like single thread limits like we have account rate limits so if you have a single account that you're writing to which is that nft the thing that defines that nft mitt you have to fill it up up to like 12 million compute units even though the block is 48 million compute compute units but as soon as you H 12 you can't add anything else so you have all this other block space for all this other [ __ ] so it's very rare that you have like an nft mint and a liquidation and all this other stuff in the same block but that does happen right for now but like what's cool is that like as the cost of Hardware decreases every two years uh we basically get twice as many cores for the same dollars so that's all we need to add more hotspots right if you have one core that we're using for SPM for Hotspot next year we can have two cores right so now twice as many hotpots we go from four to eight to 16 and at some point like we will hit that we will eventually no matter what the low it is unless human activity for demand for Block space goes up exponentially she doesn't I wish it did because then the we'd have we think it will we think it will we think it goes back and forth like we've debated this on the podcast before just as an oil Trader um what happens is oil gets discovered in a location and then you have to pipe it to refineries but usually when you discover oil there are no pipes and then there's this big race to build pipes and the first person to build a pipe makes a bunch of money and then pipes get overbuilt and then pipe space drops to you know Bargain Basement prices and all the pipeline companies go bankrupt and then more oil is discovered and then the pipeline companies resurrect themselves and make a bunch money again like in in a sense blockchains are like that because blockchains are the pipes right so some blockchains were built a while ago people didn't really want to use them and then sud you know 2021 happened and everybody wanted Defi and nfts and there wasn't enough block space and now there's too much block space it's just going to keep oscillating back and forth in our opinion and so you know we we think we're primed for a huge cycle of block space demand which is why it's interesting to talk to talk to you know you you're building it you're literally laying the pipes so I mean that's a hope and we'll see and like obviously I want that to happen too but we need like I don't know what those use cases are that will drive so much demand you have stuff like Star Atlas which is a game they're doing more transactions per day than like e L1 or polygon right like it's just one game uh the way they built it is to use the ch as much as possible for older events so stuff like this could explode but like the question is like is it like in the absence of blog space would it still would star Atlas still exist and would the users care and if the answer is yes and the users wouldn't care that still enjoy the game the same then it's not like it's being filled up with like traffic that is is like critical right like it's not like the oil is being used for driving food and like growing food and like stuff that's really really important we're like burning it to mind Bitcoin like there's superus usage and then there's like required usage I don't know if there's going to be so much required usage that we run out of blog space do that kind of differently it's almost like a intransigent minority situation where as long as you have enough requirement for Block space then you're going to have a lot of Superfluous activity on that chain as well because it's just going to work better to do everything in one place it's like what I what I view the the normal traditional systems that we use there are some things that are required to be built uh in a certain programming language and then there are certain things that are just done that way because there are certain things that are required to be built that way right and so it's you know it's sort of a the goal is to just increase the amount of activity that's required in some capacity but I think the reality is the majority of it will be superflu like it will be things that aren't necessarily required to be done on chain but are done on chain purely because you get easier access to the things that are required and that's a little bit of what of what you know I'm I'm hoping for and what I'm looking for is that you get these things that move over eventually block like blog space is created by computers computers get twice as cheap every two years it's going to increase no matter what right there's some there's some weird like networks like Bitcoin where block space is fixed for religious reasons but even like ethereum post DK sharding like the improvements that that are landing in like maybe like three four years they will get them to a point where like they will be aligned with like Hardware costs it's just inevitable so we're going into that future where like we're going to have access block box base I don't know what we're going to do with it we'll we'll see what happens so let's say let's say that ob's worst nightmare comes true or or Favorite Dream I'm not sure which uh and you have a bunch of Superfluous block space getting consumed for no reason so let's say that a bunch of people decide to spin up really basic computer games like asteroid and P on salana just arbitrarily consume [ __ ] tons of block space is that siloing you know fee hotspots mechanism you described earlier strong enough to withstand an onslaught of random crap like that yep yeah we saw that like live there was a helium I iot migration they were minting like a million nfts mad lats launch at the same time which was like a classic hotspot based mint and then you had like a bunch of random stuff oracles all that stuff worked without without a hitch it's a matter of how many concurrent like what's the network currently configured to is like to handle about four of these concurrently um and that they may sound like a little but like when you're talking about 400 millisecond kind of intervals all four things happening at the same time around the world is very very unlikely like it it's just like really really tough right like most people like human time frames oh this all happened with the same half hour that's like eons for a computer right like that's not at the same time right like so like uh yeah we have we have enough and like within two years without doing anything it'll be eight simply because the cost of the hardware will drop we can validators can add more cores and like so from my perspective like that's just kind of like the Relentless March of of progress in Mo's law if that ever stops we should all be building bunkers and like stalking stocking Boo and guns and not really worrying about crypto anymore or only worrying about bunker coin I had a question about you know just now now that I've gotten introduced to your community via Twitter and how much they care um I I wanted to ask nice just I hope folks that are listening from Sal Community just be nice to people it's cheap kindness is super cheap no actually I'm actually really impressed like I I love your community I had no idea that they were this passionate and committed and I wanted to ask you how do you build a community like that like you're obviously pass passionate about the technology but you know I'm not an engineer I'm not in these aons I'm not in the room like what how do you create this so many l1s have tried and failed but you you've succeeded where basically everybody but ethereum has has filed yeah this is um really weird I think I have some instincts that I learned from being like an like an open source dove in the 90s and trying to like find other like-minded people that were like into like hacking a Linux over the weekend you got to find like your Niche your nerds uh and like I think you have to be like you have to invest in building something that you're really interested in and I'm really interested in optimizing this thing and I can talk your ear off about like all the cool optimizations we can do and people that are into that stuff can see that I'm really interested in it and like I'm not trying to sell them on and I'm just genuinely like a a super performance nerd and that's like I think the the start of it you got to find like your tribe how big that tribe is going to be who the hell knows but like you got to be genuine and passionate that's like those are the key parts and I would worry about those two above anything else and trying to grow and I think where other things fall over is when like people try to do it in like some kind of artificial way like the earliest that we really started building a community is when we really needed um the test net up and running and it was a hard process and and weirdly like stuff that that that adds friction in that community building part also creates stickiness for the tribe uh we had we literally asked people go find a local data center not a lot of people have done this go like get a box there and install it and set it up and like maintain it and that's a very much higher friction thing than run a node on AWS so the people that we were able to convince and those to go do that are obviously far more stickier than like people that ran incentivized test net noes on AWS they ran and once got their points and then left right like if you actually spent the trouble building a computer right like geeking out on specs and like calling your local like data center right that's that's like barely has a website and like figure out that you can go put it there you're going to be committed right so that that kind of like we weird friction adds like creates like in some cases creates your tribe you can't really make it or like I don't think you can create it artificially it just like there was a reason for that friction to exist because we really needed cheap erass we needed cheap internet connectivity there's no way you're going to get at a cloud so people like understood why they were doing it and like saw the positive outcome and our tour to Soul was very generous in terms of like tokens and stuff distribution that that I think created some uh like stickiness too your community has stuck with you through some incredible yeah man social volatility like I don't know if Shaquille O'Neal is into like high performance uh you know coding but and name a list of celebrities have been in and out and it's it's so fascinating to watch I'm I'm mystified and Amazed by it frankly same it is a mystery to me I thought we were GNA be dead like more than once and like somehow like I think folks are sticking around and really see like the value of what we're doing and it it's awesome speaking of building something awesome if you had to guess what Solana's product Market fit is going to look like in you know one to five years is it is it the phone is it defi is it something else like what what do you think is going to be the next big Smash Hit I hope uh it's it's like something like helium where they have like $5 data plan iot devices that are like doing the whole cryptoeconomic Loop right there's demand here they give you more rewards the more boxes show up it's awesome like I think as from like a 50 foot view it's like the perfect like application of crypto that's creating value for like and consumers that everyone that I talk to every like Congress person that I talk to like look it's a $5 doll data plan they're like that's good that's good for my that's good for my constituents that's good for everyone I love it too why the [ __ ] hasn't it caught on yet what what's going on there like I've it for a long time have you have you used it is it is it is it usable in uh in Miami in Miami it's usable you get $5 data it's backs to T-Mobile so you can't tell whenever it's like using T-Mobile connection or or that one so they're rolling it out I hope they can go National soon and we'll see if they can like take a bite out of like a big big National provider so that's one of those like Hive mapper is another one but that's more like harder to think about it's uh like mapping data that they're collecting like you could after data set build a Google Street View competitor or like train like Tesla trains cars you can train like AI so there's like a bunch of cool really in products you can build on top but it's not as like visceral like as as like Mo reducing cost for mobile um I want to see more stuff like helium I don't know what that is but I really want to point to like something that my parents can use and tell them if you use this use a salana and it's cheaper or better than something that's some alternative so like I think with finance and banking it's going to take a while it's clearly better but like I don't know maybe within five years Congress passes a law with in five years we have like usdc based wallet accounts with yields it's better than banking because you're never get overdraft fees you never get monthly fees you have all this transparency and stuff that that could be like I think an easy one to point to but that one it's just like law and finances uh my theory is that like we're going through the process of like software eating the world right like natural process it's now starting to eat place where governments and humans have a wanted control right like Finance is very touched to government and uh it's like uh there's a lot of tension there right like people don't want to give up control over stuff but like it's inevitable like within 50 years can you imagine like Banks still run by like 10,000 people like trying to figure out all this stuff by hand like so crazy right like there's no there's no way yeah they're fighting it pretty hard right now I mean just to your point about Finance the fact that a fincial transaction settles in two days for you know typical two business days not even calendar days for a you know for a high value you know Wall Street type trade is incredible to me in the world of zero interest rates who cares but you know if if you're short-term interest rate is above 5% trillions of dollars of capital are being held up all over the world for two days you know if you could just let that out how much value could be created in theory is salana could do that if it just replaced existing Financial infrastructure but like you said there's some people who don't want that out there so when you talk to uh when you talk to Congress people and Regulators especially in the wake of what happened with uh you know SPF making everyone upset about all of this um how do you how do you how do you cool the Jets in Washington how do you expl first of all a lot of folks are super smart that are involved in government that may not seem like it uh they're very smart but there's also a lot of politics and politics is populism it's like trying to build a narrative and like sometimes it it's kind of stupid like people try to like snipe each other or whatever uh that's the theater of it but under the hood very very smart people are trying their best right because they have to like fight these other counternarratives and like stay relevant and all this stuff and raise money it's a system that's very competitive so like I I'm very bullish on it as being like a robust system to get the right people eventually to do the right thing I think it's much much better than like any alternatives out there uh but it takes time um so the most important narrative you can show folks is like this is like a product that your voters will actually benefit from Helium is like my go-to example the finance ones are harder because you have like Wall Street Journal will publish a totally incorrect estimate of how much how much terrorist activity uses crypto and then you got to be like no that was wrong yep this this is there's here's all the counterpoints this is how why using a public immutable Ledger is the dumbest place place to do any kind of crime and then they got it they need like that those bullet points and stuff and then there's like people with like like Warren I think I don't know she hasn't she I don't know what why what's driving her internally I'm actually quite curious to find out why she's so anti- crypto is it because this is her base of power is the financial committee and that she wants appointees that can have human control or the bank or does she really believe that there's value that is being created there for for like consumers like you got to figure that out and that part I don't know yet but most people are smart crypto is a technology they get the benefit of it you can explain that those benefits and eventually eventually the right thing will happen it's kind of it just takes time speaking of the right thing winning I wna I want to wrap up by asking you why why is salana going to Crush ethereum in your mind why is salana the right thing why is salana the right thing to win crush is like it's very that part I don't know like I think okay like ethereum like had awesome success it was first to Market with a smart contract and now their momentum is driving them towards a particular part in this parto efficient curve of tradeoffs of what a layer one blockchain should look like they cannot re they cannot change themselves to salana right like there's it' be really really hard for ethereum to rewrite everything and become salana right like just the way that the ecosystems moving that piece of code and everything else they're moving towards this like multi-layer model it's fine right we also like because of my the way my brain works and my passion how I like kicked off the project salana is moving into a different SP spot in that parto efficient curve we're going to build a single layer one that's can host as many applications as possible to the point that there should be it should be more expensive for you to take an app and run it on your own app chain then to use Salona that's it it should be like economically irrational to do that you will still do it for other reasons but there should be no economic reason to do that whether that which one wins who the hell knows this is up to the to the pmf gods the whatever right like I don't see a world where like somehow ethereum loses and salana wins because of that I think you're going to see like probably EVs and flows of some applications being built on salana some on ethereum and stuff will shift and who knows maybe salana will be 90% of the world's transactions will happen in salana but 90% of the tvl will be on ethereum who won I don't know right like you you kind of you cannot you cannot really tell what what like what that is um my core thing is that like people are using the chain they're building apps on it they're building stuff that consumers want and like creating value if we get that right we have a shot of being of beating ethereum crushing them right whatever yeah I I asked it in the most inflammatory way possible but I like I like the sentence that I can now quote tweet and just tell everybody you said which is you're economically irrational if you use ethereum I'm just going to no said it's irrational to use an app Chain versus running an app on salana it's gonna get it's going to get more Retreats the other way love okay do it you can you can say that no totally I I I really appreciate you spending the time uh time with us today this was I mean you know I I I sat I sat here and I listened for most of it but I I feel like I learned I learned a ton for sure hearing you speak and and Jonah some great some great questions in there so you know this has been thank you for sharing a really well articulated Vision with us toally that was I learned a lot too I kind of Blown Away I've got to go back to the drawing board now thank you guys for having me we're we're all working in open source software we're all kind of in the same side so like the all all the details don't really matter over the long [Music] term

Transcript Text:
we're in a very shaky place for risk overall I think that the time to be aggressive is when everybody's talking about a recession I think that any buy below 25k on BTC you're going to look like a genius in a year yeah so it's just a matter of making sure that you have a good entry point well there you have it don't fight the flows don't you you just you just don't don't fight the [Music] flows welcome back to another episode of thousand X it is been a extremely eventful two weeks Joan and I are back in our homes you know and we've been we've been watching this unfold over the last over the last 72 hours and I'll say that it's going to be a very interesting period for the markets crypto risk oil just across the board it's time to it's time to pay attention in my opinion agree there's going to be a lot of opportunity out there over the coming over the coming weeks but there's also going to be a lot of danger and so you know I think as the biggest obviously the biggest new story of the week is this conflict that's come up in Israel you see defense stocks up locked was up about 11% at the peak today paler was up and you're seeing oil go up as well which I thought about for a bit and I went back and as to whether oil would go up or not just purely because the people fighting have nothing to do I mean there's no oil in Israel there's no oil in Gaza um so you know there is a little bit of should it should it should it go up um but Jonah you know I'd be curious I think you you you come from a world where geopolitics is extremely important and so you probably got a good knack for understanding how these things might impact the markets so I'm curious what you're you know what what your gut take is after digesting the news yeah sure um let's start with oil so oil is up because whenever there is conflict in the Middle East it's a knee-jerk reaction for oil to Rally but if you delve a little deeper um the leadership of Hamas has openly thanked Iran for helping them plan this attack the Wall Street Journal has reported something to that effect um you know I I obviously have no idea what Iran's involvement in this particular conflict is but the market perceives Iran uh to be sort of an involved participant now Iran is a huge oil producer um and they are currently sanctioned by the United States um which makes it difficult for them to sell their oil on the open market uh there have been years of attempts at diplomacy between the Biden Administration and even when Biden was VP during the Obama Administration uh to lift those sanctions and allow Iran to export freely again and those talks have been progressing recently so this conflict would be a setback to that diplomacy which uh you know obviously if if Iran can export that means lower oil prices if they can't export that means higher oil prices so a setback to diplomacy which would lead to higher Iranian exports means higher prices bit of a bit tough to follow but not that crazy um the you know the sort of side baseball here is that Iran is quietly exporting all of their oil anyway or close to it so even if the sanctions were to be lifted it wouldn't actually uh result in in much of a a difference in global exports but it has to be at lower prices much lower prices than what they would get otherwise oh yeah I mean but but what the the price that you see on the screen is that's that's just like sort of an amalgamation of all different oil prices in the world I mean like you're looking at renter TI and those benchmarks those bench benchmarks factor in global supply and demand right it's not you're not looking at the price of Iranian crude when you look at crude so that's crude right that's why you got a knee-jerk rally um even though the the balance of supply and demand doesn't really change that much one way or another it's just a setback another thing is Wars consume a lot of petroleum um but Israel is a small country and this this war probably wouldn't consume that much petroleum meanwhile you know if you had like China mobilizing against India that would probably be a big deal but that's that's not happening we hope that's a good overview of the situation and one thing that stands out to me is that despite crypto decorrelating from risk a ton over the last month uh which is normally a bullish a bullish signal so I mean if you if you look at it over the last 30 days you know the S&P has traded down and bitcoin's actually traded up over that time period I think unfortunately a part of that is definitely sailor buying uh and I think that what you're what you what you're GNA get if how much did he buy 500 million was it BTC sailor yeah but it's it it's one of those it's one of those things that if you look at it just zoomed out we're in a very shaky place for risk overall because I think that flows still look flows still look bad you have this conflict that's escalating in higher oil is very bad for for risk for risk prices uh especially right now because inflation because inflation and rates are rates are already booming I mean bond market is selling off massively over over the last over the last price of bonds down yields up yes yeah price bonds down yields up and I think that has long lasting impacts that take a while to show up in the in in the real in the real economy and so what what you get is you have this you have this perfect storm and I think one other issue was that the market was pricing in a soft Landing pretty aggressively and we're slowly starting to go the other way I think that the time to be aggressive is when everybody's talking about a recession when everybody and their mother is looking around they're going yep there's no way that we have a soft landing on the horizon we're going into a recession I think that's when it's going to be a good time to start start scaling in and so all of that being said I don't think that Bitcoin has enough idiosyncratic juice to avoid a draw down if the broader risk markets go down which is why I'm positioned very cautiously right now I think puts are are a good idea um you know to both two week and and and four week puts I think V is pretty low eth obviously in more trouble than BTC but also more shorter than BTC um so you know you have to you have you have to weigh that weigh that a little bit just looking at looking at open interest a lot more shorts open on Ethan than yeah eth is eth is just eth is going south fast I mean you you know I'm sure you you know more than I do at this point Obi but I just look at nft floor prices like crypto punks you know down 20% theor uh in the last couple weeks um gas gas prices on eth we're looking at nine guay um you know neutral for the flip between inflationary and deflationary eth is what 15 16 gay and we're we're trading you know gas prices are are well below that level so there's just not a lot of activity yeah there's also there's also the FTX guy that's just has had 180,000 eth he's out he's as of current recording he's out of about let me see half of of it well there you have it don't fight the flows don't you you just you just don't don't fight the flows so I mean if you're going to buy anything you might as well just buy Bitcoin at this point there's some alts that are doing well like link like dydx but overall I mean this is this is a this this is a bad Market to be to to be to be long in uh you know I I'm waiting personally I'm waiting for the flush I think that any buy below 25k on BTC you're going to look like a genius in a year so it's just a matter of making sure that you have a good entry point because I mean if you buy like right if you're like buying 275 and you draw down 10% then you start to feel a little bit skittish maybe you trade 24 and then you start to you start to get real worried and then psychologically you're you know you're you're hurt I think that you basically just focus on getting on getting good entries so you're not psychologically tormented if we go down to 22 Yeah and then just and then just wait I mean realistically like if you think about it long term this is is actually quite good for I think conflict in the world well terrible is good for Bitcoin it's very good and Global disorder is good for Bitcoin because it is a an impartial Reserve asset that anyone can stash when the US starts going sanction crazy and the other thing you mentioned interest rates Obi um when when we're sitting here in a year's time and interest rates are still explosive and mortgages are still expensive at some point home prices are going to start to tank and then the United States government in an election year is going to face a very difficult Choice it's like do you know the choice is do we let American homeowners do we let the middle class take the medicine that should have been taken in 2008 and again in 2020 and just tank the whole thing and cost ourselves the election or do we pump more stimulus in and uh print more money and bring yields down and do all of these things that governments do you know free beer for everybody do do the things that governments do to get reelected right I have a feeling it's going to be the ladder in fact I'd put my money on it and at that point maybe you're looking at $100,000 BTC or higher because that that is that is what BTC is purpose-built to hedge the investor against that's the long term the short term it's like who cares about Bitcoin when there's geopolitical conflict the only thing that's been holding stocks up is AI Mania Nvidia what ever like we you know things could tank pretty hard in the short term tread tread carefully tread lightly and and stay Nimble I agree with you Obby you picked such an interesting time to get back into that game it's uh it's always an interesting time to get into oil or into crypto there's always something going on like let's say that you started in in oil with a clean slate right now it could be like well you know it's a it's in a precarious position it could go up a lot or down a lot like if if there's a re recession oil could tank 30% if there's a massive geopolitical conflict in the Middle East oil could rally 50% right so you sort of have to tread lightly otherwise you get steamrolled in your new role equally in crypto um we both think this thing is going to 10x over you know on a you know three to five year timeline um but you might not be able to hang on to the mechanical bull right you might get thrown off so I think all markets are in very sort of tenuous position and that's because of the 10 years where they weren't in a tenuous position which is like 2010 to 2020 when Janet Yellen kept her foot on the gas for like five years longer than she should have right so there was a long period of time where markets were just super boring and then that's set up for a time basically driven by interest rates and geopolitical conflict where all markets including crypto and crude oil and natural gas and equities and everything else are going to be super volatile and treacherous but also you know really rewarding for people that that play it right yeah that that that honestly like that specific set of circumstances does make me think that the probability that we end up going sideways in Bitcoin or crypto for a substantial period of time is higher than people expect like I think one thing that people forget is there doesn't there doesn't have to be a cycle there doesn't have to be another Bull Run in 2024 2025 just because that's how it's worked in the in the past I think it's it you know in the back of everybody's mind that's almost taken for granted but there were very specific circumstances that led to that that may or may not happen again I think you know long term my view of the world is obviously Bitcoin has a much greater place but that could be in 2026 or 2027 which is why I'm spending a lot of time in on the other areas right of digital assets of crypto it's like okay well I actually had the benefit of playing around with Stars Arena which was the platform that got hacked and kind of that that was built that was built on avac and I tweeted about this and I I said just to be clear I said I would not put real money on this platform but the reality is the product itself was pretty good it's a competitor to friendtech and I used it and it was you know it had a it had a feed it had a better messaging system like the product was more fun to use than frch and so we're we actually are seeing iterations now that are making consumer products for crypto better and we are seeing usage and I you know if it hadn't gotten hacked I think that it would it would be doing quite well quite well today just by virtue of it being it being a good product um you know not advocating anybody put money on it obviously is it's been hacked twice but it's one of those things that makes you realize hey okay maybe they're actually some good applications slowly coming out and so investing in the tech investing in the infra it's like okay this stuff this stuff can actually decorrelate over a long enough time period you could you you might find that Bitcoin could be down 15 20% over the course of a year and there could there are going to be things that are up 100 per. yeah you just have to be one of the few people left paying attention I mean I if it didn't get hacked that's a big if right like oh if it had a good user experience if it didn't get hacked if there was no fraudulent SPF type character um roles involved in in in you know all of these ifs you you kind of crypto just it's a little bit too plagued with problems at the moment and I feel like to have its next big summer you need to have like five to 10 amazing new products and use cases come out that are secure userfriendly and run by competent operators and I feel like we're due for that um I'm just yeah the competent operator is being key yeah exactly because I mean anybody can spin up a project at the at the valuation space of 2021 and uh run it into the ground I I feel like you you need lower prices to Foster you know good stewardship of a project um it does it does it does make me sad just because it it was it was a pretty solid like it it was a it was it was a pretty solid product that that got hacked I was like okay those things good so FTX got hacked as well what what happened there some some guys stole how many eth and then do you mind talking about I wanted to ask you as well AI so there's the FTX hacker and then there's the FTX um administrator custodian whatever you call it Galaxy so what are these two entities doing and how much are they selling each week it's a really it's a it's a really good question and the answer is uh it's going to take a very long time to actually come up with the plan so they in the process right now of actually figuring out what assets to sell how to sell them over what time period to sell them and this plan has to be approved and so this this this selling is going to take a while to actually occur uh it's obviously going to be an overhang on the on the market but it's really mostly going to be an overhang for salana uh as relative relative to everything else because the actual Supply that they have at BTC and ether much much lower in terms of circulating cap than Sal looks Rich at $22 I agree with you it does I it's one of those things I really like over a oh wow look we're we get we're getting a nice little selloff here on uh on BTC I'm personally I think euts are a great idea I think they just I think they just make sense right now um I I would Finance them by selling calls I I would just buy Bare risk reversals bu put sell call I don't see eth exploding higher in the next couple weeks there's too much selling no there's the the issue the issue right now with the market is that there's no real reason for people to step in and buy and what I mean by that is you have you had the grayscale lawsuit resolve itself and so the only positive Catalyst to the upside is the ETF at this point and so the way that I always think about these types of things are you have you have your um momentum buyers who are currently momentum sellers and then you have your value buyers and when I look at Bitcoin I don't see value until 25k or lower and so there's really nobody that's gonna in my opinion there's nobody that's going to step in aggressively until until those levels and on eth it's it's much it's much lower I think one of the issues with eth has actually been you know con conversely the uh prevalence of l2s and the amount of activity that l2s have relative to relative to the Bas layer because the argument was always well if you increase throughput by 100x which has happened then you should increase transactions by 100x but that hasn't happened it's not even close to happen what you've just done is you've just moved all the transactions from eth to arbitrum and you've barely increased the overall amount of transactions that are occurring and so from my perspective what you get is there's going to be a big lag period over the next year where eth just looks like [ __ ] on a fee basis and everyone was kind of expecting it to look good on a on a deflationary basis um but that's just not not going to be the case as as long as activity is you know mostly on base or mostly on arbitrum or mostly on optimism so I'm actually quite I'm quite negative on eth um for the for the time being you know it'll it'll it'll have it it'll have its time again but I think for for for right for right now I'm quite bearish on the eth BTC ratio I used to be bullish on eth because all these scaling Solutions were being built like I you know just being a California guy growing up in the state of California um they're always adding Lanes to the freeways and it never seems to ease the traffic right like every time they add a new Lane it just brings more cars onto the freeway so uh basically you know after a while you start to wonder like what's the point of doing this you just you you don't ease the the bottleneck and I thought the same thing would happen to eth I thought it would be like okay you have this you have this block chain whose block space is constantly in like there's an excess of demand relative to supply gas prices are insane you have to spend $200 to buy an nft that's worth $20 like how the [ __ ] you know so I I just assumed that scaling solutions would um would ultimately bring more flow to eth and make the product more scalable and make it this Global World computer faster and it would be like the California freeway instead it's actually looking more like the way that uh pipelines work in the peran Basin in Texas where sometimes there's just too much oil not enough pipelines can't you know everything's bottleneck so there's this frenzy of pipeline building which is effectively a scaling solution for an oil field and then uh then suddenly there's just way too much pipeline capacity and not enough oil and then then it goes back and forth so I think I think eth you know yet another analogy between eth and oil I think it looks more like uh scaling Solutions were overbuilt during a particular time in eth's history when there was a lot of demand for it and now there's not a lot of demand for eth because no one cares right now and way too much capacity and so gas prices are just forced into the toilet and I agree with you I think the pendulum will swing back the other way hard one day when it's like holy [ __ ] we have this thing that's cheaper and better than AWS for our use case and probably more permanent but like um you know that might be a year year off or six months off or two years off who knows there's no OPEC for eth it's an issue um so there's a foundation and they're selling right yeah they're selling right now they're they're increasing Supply at the worst possible time even though they sell very small size they've been remarkably consistent at selling tops local tops and I think it's very funny because I think that it's like they I think they sold two and a half million this time which is dude that's nothing but everybody's talking about it and everybody's like oh my God what do they know this time it's self-reinforcing is the thing right so they do it they do it right once uh and then feel like oh my God they must know something and then they do and then you know people uh you know people start to uh people start to panic yeah yeah I mean it look if your entire net worth is in eth right now you should be panicking but um if you if eth is part of a diversified portfolio uh as we've Rec recommended you know maybe you shouldn't be panicking maybe it's more like uh oh cool this thing I mean I I I would definitely reduce eth exposure I think I think the right the right level for E BTC to become a giga is uh 0. five well if you're like me and you own nfts um your eth exposure reduces naturally for you on sell-offs it's like a gamma position right when during these periods of time where eth goes down the value of your nfts denominated in eth also goes down so I have less eth than I I did when eth was High it's amazing how it self- corrects like that Jenna yeah um that's good at this point I think I think you're right I think so also there was that Futures ETF that launched for Ethan while in and of itself I don't think it's that relevant because no one cares about a Futures ETF anymore people just want spot they don't just such a bad product yeah it's it like the product itself is like you could only imagine a world of people buying tons of it at a Pico top where it's just like oh my god get me eth exposure somehow anyhow I don't even want to read the perspectus like obviously in a bare Market something with contango roll yield isn't gonna isn't going to attract anybody so I I'm not like reading into the poor ETF launch as like oh wow look at how doomed crypto is I'm more looking at it as like you launch a crappy product in a down market and no one cares yeah I think um one one issue is that BTO was live so everybody could see just how shitty that like how terrible that product is yeah and the fact that although one one thing one thing that's funny is um you tend to uh people actually overestimate how bad it is because if you look at the returns it's underperforming Bitcoin by something like 30% just from a pure like price basis but they have dividends and cash distributions and that actually compensates for a lot of it so I think it's actually only underperforming by 10% but that's still bad that's still very bad only underperforming by 10% so you know you know what doesn't underperform by 10% is stable coins um AI what do you think about the world of stables right now and specifically the the leakage in usdc there's a concept that good money drives out or bad money dri out good money and I think that's what's happening right now is you have a lot of people people in China people in Russia that want dollars and they want to have you know real doll maybe they want to buy real estate in the US or they want to go buy other Goods in in the US because they want to protect their protect their portfolio they don't want Too much exposure to the ruble or to the to the Yan and a lot of people are using tether to get out of this in my opinion and based on the flows that we're seeing and the people that we're talking to this actually seems like a very common occurrence people are just buying buying tether to get out of the get get out of their base currency and so if you actually look uh a lot of tether grow like tether growth is almost one to one coincided with usdc Decline and I think what's what's happening is that people are because you can Source tether if in China and Hong Kong and in these places you buy the tether you create the tether then you take the tether you go to binance you go to oex or you go to wobe you go sell it into usdc then you send the usdc to somebody else who has an account with coinbase they redeem it and then you get you buy something in in the US whether it's real estate or something else and then you transfer over the deed right and so that Dynamic I think is actually occurring not infrequently right now so just for the listeners that's and that and that's leading to the the cont raction of the usdc supply because if you think about it usdc is a better product it's just that that and and the the irony of the situation is it's dying because it's such a good product I I don't know if I have the same opinion I mean I think that usdc is a better product from a mint redeem perspective it's like technically a better product but it's it's Target demographic is the developed world where crypto is not a solution like you us like crypto is a solution right now for emerging markets for underbanked markets for people without access to stable currencies or JP Morgan checking accounts right that's where Bitcoin and stable coins are really useful um so ultimately if usdc serves the the you know provides a much more optimal technical solution but serves the developed markets where that solution is not needed it's going to lose market share to you know the technically in inferior uh asset that serves the market that actually demands it so since the beginning of the year since since Jan 23 the market cap of tether has exploded from 65 billion to $85 billion and has been very stable at 85 billion since the summer meanwhile usdc Circle has collapsed from 40 billion to 25 billion so a $15 billion Decline and ultimately I think that what this is telling you is that there is a use case for crypto right now a very important one and it's preserving dollarized value in the form of tether um and whatever sort of developed Mark like so I I think it's emerging markets that are still using crypto for their sort of purpose-built use case and maybe developed markets are giving up on crypto a little bit and then there's probably some cycling uh a lot of cycling uh in you know sort of what you just described OB probably a lot of that is going on as well I think so I mean I I think that it's just it's at the end of the day it's demand for dollars and usdc is the best form of dollar right now I I also think by the way that's why you're seeing a is the best form of dollar usdc usdc but the market cap of usdc is collapsed because people know that it's backed by dollars oh right I see so redeeming it into yeah okay right so it's if you want if you want dollars your best bet is to buy usdc and redeem it for dollars so from that perspective it's the best like it's the best product it's the best it's a best way to access usdt US USD in my why why not tether like why why can't you just redeem tether and get your dollars back I guess it's because yeah the mint redeem mechanism for tether is a little bit more complicated it's much harder yeah you have to work with specified counterparties um I also think that there's you know potentially some words like okay well do do I do I want to go through the process of redeeming redeeming with USD DT have and then have wires to the US from usdt bank accounts we probably don't want that actually probably not easier to just use the coinbase usdc channel exactly it's much much easier to use a coinbase USD usdc Channel there's a drain in Fiat in the general in the general ecosystem right now um and that's actually one thing that by the way I think is is pretty useful for figuring out what your risk tolerance should be in the markets like one just one anecdote is that we use uh the stable coins deployed in the market um so for example just like take all the I take the top wallets that are active that are active Traders and just calculate what their average stable coin balances over the last year and then when it goes up really high that's actually a good Buy Signal when it goes when it goes down pretty low that's it's a good sell signal because there's just not that much Fiat left in the system to either buy to buy to buy or sell um but in in aggregate there's just been a there there's there's been a drain that's not that's not that's not good um which is why again I'm advocating for just pay I'm advocating for patients I'm advocating the bare view I don't expect eth to test the FTX lows like I don't think it's going to get that bad on apathy I think that's a forced selling flush liquidation type price set so I don't know I don't know how many of you listeners out there have researched the Kelly Criterion but um it's worth pulling up on Wikipedia and maybe doing a little spreadsheet and just typing in your own probabilities of where you think different like where like different price points and and the probability of uh eth reaching them it's amazing how let's say that you're banned for eth is sort of like like you know let's call it two standard deviations within the next year is sort of like ,000 eth to $2,000 eth it's amazing how quickly the risk reward of being short gets like it goes from amazing to terrible as eth goes from like 1,600 to, 1400 how quickly how quickly your your risk reward shifts and how how how how scared you should be being short at 1400 uh becomes as uh you know as you approach sort of the bottom of your distribution and personally I don't think eth is going to go much much below 12200 I think that would be like an absolutely dire liquidation flush like everyone just gives up on it type level um it it would be lower but I think already half the space threw in the towel during FTX so I think the level is higher now ultimately um like Obi said uh tread lightly here and I think it's more of a more of a thing for investors to add on dips rather than Traders trying to dance between the rain drops and capture $100 a token selling now and buying later you framed it well um at 1,400 I think you basically have a floor at 1,100 and so the the risk reward there just becomes very very skewed which is why I think that you're probably going to get a lot of chop between this 1650 area and this F you know 1 1500 area just because that is the area where risk award is the most balanced if you're looking for if you're looking for a move to if you're looking for a move to 2K you're looking for a move to to 1100 that's just the most balanced area for you and so I think that's where that's where the real battle is going to take place and if we break down into the lower lower portion of that that's a that's a that's a buying opportunity which is just kind of what I've been saying right it's you just you're just looking for good areas to add length so that you look like a genius in a year this is you're you're absolutely right and you have to have that year time frame um also if you read crypto Twitter frequently enough as you know probably most of the people who listen to this podcast do you see people just like throwing in the towel like giving up on eth like this is it I've been long e since $100 and it's over now like this is a useless piece of [ __ ] asset like you read tweets where people who have been eating for five years are just like it's over never buying this crap again like I'm selling all my eth and so if you're you know if you're just and if investing or trading isn't your profession but you hold some eth in your personal account and you care about your net worth like you you look at your eth and and you look at these tweets and you're probably saying to yourself like crap I'm I'm gonna get out remind yourself if that's what you're thinking that in 12 or 18 or 24 months when this thing is gassing higher and it's trading $5,000 a token um those very same people will be talking about how eth is the future how it's going to $50,000 a token how they've been long all the way up right so you kind of have to filter out the noise and remember that dude I love it I love it when you go Giga it's like a like this it's like a it's like a pro it's a probability distribution it's a gradient of outcomes it's not black and white eth is not over eth is not the future it's it's like this constantly evolving uh shade of gray although I I I I will I will say just one one thing is I am I am worried about l1's in general and what happens when block space becomes very cheap I guess you know it it remains to be seen but you're we're really going to need to increase the amount of transactions that go through these networks and so what you might find is you might you might just we might just be going through a dead period for l1s which is why I'm so focused on applications right now because in order for l1's to do well over the next couple of years you really need applications to do very well over the next couple of years because l1s have become so much more efficient over the last 18 months right with all the launches of the l2s and you you've got you've got ZK ZK coming out soon so I think that it's just it's just going to be all all about the All About the apps and I think we we've sort of beaten that beaten that horse I don't want to get too deep into it one game could bowl over like it can only take one application to generate more transaction volume than the network has ever seen in its entire history right I don't know maybe a game or a back office payments application Visa I don't know uh what do you think what what type of application would you want are you looking for I yeah I I think I think it's I think gaming is the most likely then you have the social social Finance as well um but realistically Ally I think that one thing that could really take off is if you got tokenized uh tokenized stock trading bond trading on chain I mean I know Goldman's trying to come out with their money market fund in uh in q1 of next year and that's going to be big and we'll see if it's composable with the rest of rest I doubt it but we'll see if it's composable with the rest of the world but the more products that launch like that I think the better off uh you know the the better off we we get in in crypto and that that's something that I could really see taken off massively look at Cano so they're doing a lot in the rwa space right now and if they like one of the things that they're teasing is they're teasing a launch of a a treasury product and for example like what if they allow you to like lever up treasuries that would be that that that would be a good use case for for crypto yeah so you know we we we'll see if you're in crypto it should be for the big wins it's not to like dance Between The Raindrops and Chip around I I mean honestly like I I know there are a lot of Market neutral funds out there and I'm sure some of them are really successful and run by brilliant people with great investors and everything but like I think that whole sector has been torched over the course of the last year and a half because they've taken so much risk a lot of them lost assets on FTX which was ironically the best place to get short crypto uh so there was probably a lot of people using FTX perss to sell this or that altcoin and you know people probably lost a lot of money on that and then and then uh and then now we're still in a bare Market let's say that you want to be short my favorite um dead horse to beat short polka dot versus long eth like where you gonna get short polka dot Finance like is there any efficient way to do that so like the the market neutral strategies involve a leg where you get short something that there's no efficient way to get short so like it it doesn't work right you have to be in this for the the asymmetric upside and you have to find ways to survive during times like like these so you need y you need investors that are that are in it for the long haul you need investors who want exposure to crypto you can't just like sell sell a market neutral strategy to an investor base that's like uninterested in crypto you have I agree with that you know I agree with that um there's been a good conversation Jonah always is Obby thank you always fun this is this this is dope we'll do it again we'll do it again in two weeks stay safe out there everybody this world is looking complicated and tricky again hopefully when we talk next time we will be out of this situation but if not I'll see you uh see you in World War I till then ABI good talk good stuff Jonah [Music]

Description:
In today's episode of 1000x Jonah and Avi are back from a brief hiatus and ready to dive into the biggest movements in the crypto markets. The duo begin by diving into the potential opportunities that lay within crypto and oil and uniquely discuss oil & USDT use-cases for global oil transactions. Turning to crypto, the guys dive into Polygon's significant lead in zk implementations and how Asia based investors are particularly interested in this innovation. To close things out they discuss their market outlooks and why altcoins may struggle to perform.

Transcript Text:
I still believe that there is no asset that will perform better than let's just say Bitcoin and eth uh or account you know or or like a golden tree fund run by Avi Feldman that adds Alpha to bitcoin and eth like I think those are the those are sort of the things that you can invest in in crypto that will earn you 10x 15x returns over the next decade at a minimum [Music] welcome back to another episode of a thousand X I know we've taken a bit of a Hiatus but we're happy to be back and in full force there are a couple things that have changed though that I'll let Jonah talk about in a minute here but one thing that hasn't really changed is the price of Bitcoin which remains flat and dead so giving us a lot of time to spend efforts on going to the gym looking at other markets and in general just enjoying life so Jonah tell us how's your life been yeah life's been life's been hectic I mean the first big change the folks at blockwork sent me this microphone because I was previously using like a webcam mic uh so they got sick of editing and now we have this beautiful FM radio voice that everyone gets to listen to so thank you block works very deep it's like really really makes your voice baritone it gets higher and higher throughout the day as I use it more and more maybe I should just not talk like Taylor Swift and then only podcast um right so the big update from my side is that I have left Cumberland I I resigned uh a couple weeks ago the rationale for doing that is that you know natural resource markets got pretty roiled last year um oil in particular that is my sort of native asset class and an opportunity came along to return to that market that was that was really good so you know I still deeply believe in crypto I still have you know fairly substantial crypto Holdings I haven't changed that if anything I've added to it um but I will not be focused on crypto day to day because you know as a Trader you take the opportunities when they come and the pull from from the oil Market was just too strong for me to resist at this particular time in my life um I think there's tremendous opportunity in crypto because you know it's almost like I got pulled into crypto uh when crypto was was booming and now I'm getting pulled back into oil when oil is booming and I I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that that most people do what I've done you're supposed to you're supposed to keep a steady hand on the markets and you're not supposed to just Chase what the hot new thing you're not supposed to like pivot to Commodities right now or pivot to AI three weeks ago or pivot to semiconductors um but you know if you've been if you've been you know fostering uh you know 17-year career in one asset class it can it you know they can pull you back now one thing I do want to say the folks at Cumberland they are top-notch I had the best experience I I could have possibly asked for at that place um they provide the best liquidity you're gonna get if you're an institution looking to trade crypto um I I've you know gotten a very detailed look under the hood there and what they do to to provide those sort of markets for institutions like golden tree and anyone else to trade you know crypto assets it's it's not an art it's it's a real science and they have the best people so um you know thank you very much Don Wilson and Cumberland for for employing me and for giving me that wonderful experience um highly highly recommend trading with Cumberland you know that's actually really important because it's so difficult to find a good counterparty I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad that you say that secure counterpart I mean and and really yeah secure secures I think an important an important point there it's it's so hard to find people that we're unwilling to trade with willing to hold risk with in this space I have to ask you're the second person that I've seen in the last month leave crypto to join the whole Market you had Benoit over at GSR go back and I think he's not Millennium now yeah we used to work together yo you guys used to work together yeah same desk he uh he was the reason why I moved to London um we co-ran the crude oil Market making desk at Goldman Sachs and he was the London guy I was the New York guy and then we switched places in 2014 early 14. okay so are you guys going back to the market to effectively trade the same thing that you were doing for the last 17 years or do you think your rule is going to change a bit um you know it's interesting you ask I can't speak for Benoit he you know he his last oil roll was at Goldman so he's he's moving to the buy side now that's fairly different um than Market making but still a lot of overlap and I think he'll be a tremendous success there he just started uh as for me I'm not going back to what I was doing before um I'm gonna be launching a new adventure which I think is important when you are a Trader if you're intellectually like I mean I don't know plenty of Traders do phenomenally well and make great fortunes for themselves and their families doing the same thing uh just becoming a master of a very specific craft or in some cases you know advancing through the ranks of a company and overseeing more and more and scaling their skills um I have never either just by my own political incompetence or you know trading uh you know suckiness I've never I've never like felt the need to rise within one company I've always tried to challenge myself learn new asset classes and move around um to try and like bolt on new skill sets and diversify and broaden what I do so um this time I'm gonna be sort of heading towards a role that's a mixture of prop trading and also what I was doing at Cumberland sort of um sort of uh attachment to a crude oil business can I I gotta ask you one more question about crude oil I know that this is a crypto podcast but I'm just very interested in this so why is this year why are you saying that this year is so great for oil because when I look at last year I see prices went you know it looks like they went from 75 at the beginning of the year in 2022 to like almost 120 during 2022 and this year they've almost been within this 15 range like what what this year why is it this year why wasn't it last year last year it seems like it was actually the real explosion last year was the real explosion okay this here has well last year and this year have set up for a prolonged period of fruitful trading opportunity in crypto and here's why um and crypto sorry in in oil trading um and crypto trading too I see what's still on your mind by the way well first of all let me reassure the listeners of this podcast you're not going to be forced to listen to a bunch of microeconomic track about the crude oil Market Avi and I are going to keep it very tailored to what you care about um which is probably crypto but we're gonna have a slightly more broad diverse perspective at this point um I would say that the situation that happened in Russia where basically the oil Market went from ESG you know when our electric vehicle is going to eat into demand to the point where the price goes to zero like that was the narrative before Russia after Russia it's about security of Supply like the world still needs a bunch of oil right now you know more than 100 million perils a day of it a barrel is you know about yay high 42 gallons inside you know it's 100 100 203 million of it gets consumed 100 203 million barrels of that get consumed every day by by the human race it's it's not it's not something we can just do away with right so security of supply has been brought into question and then that changes everybody's uh economics and equation when they buy it refiners in particular um nation states as well like Joe Biden emptied the Strategic petroleum Reserve to keep gasoline prices down during the Russia conflict um but he has yet to really fill it back up that's a problem you know those sorts of those sorts of uh dialogues become relevant in crude oil but more importantly interest rates going up right when interest rates go up the hundreds of billions of dollars it takes to extract oil from the ground and bring it to Market those dollars become more expensive they're not just you know floating around anymore um you you have to you have to pay pretty high interest rates just to get access to Capital even if you're Exxon so what that's going to do is set up a structural under Supply um for the next couple years while the market still has demand for this stuff so then you'll get kind of a run up in price and then demand will get killed and EVS will you know accelerate and then and then you'll probably uh then you'll probably start to tank so I think that's why companies are excited to have people come in and trade oil but equally I think there's those same factors have made crypto relevant more so than ever and while I might not be in the the market making business anymore in crypto I I still I still believe that there is no asset that will perform better than let's just say Bitcoin and eth uh or account you know or or like a golden tree fund run by Avi Feldman that adds Alpha to bitcoin and eth like I think those are the those are sort of the things that you can invest in in crypto that will earn you 10x 15x returns over the next decade at a minimum that's really it's really interesting that makes that makes a lot of sense I I I do think there's what's what's interesting what's interesting right now is that there seems to be some some overlap with what's going on in the in in the oil in the oil world and what's going on in the crypto world one thing that that stood out to me is when I was visiting Hong Kong there are all these articles that were popping up about the tens or dozens of Hong Kong trading firms that have appeared overnight that are all trading Russian oil or that are all exporting oil and it's assumed to be it's assumed to be Russian oil because they're all getting in at 60 a barrel you know out of out of Russia and selling it selling it basically a massive markup on the on the free market and the other thing that struck me is how widespread you know usdt is there for getting Capital out of the capital out of Hong Kong I think there's a lot of Mainland money that is coming is coming out that way I mean I wouldn't be surprised if there was some oil trading being done in Bitcoin or usdt right now I wouldn't be surprised either and I think that intelligent oil trading companies will eventually add that on to their platforms add usdt eat Bitcoin onto their platforms I mean and it's not like some sort of dark sketchy agenda oil oil has always found its way from you know the oil wells of of one adversary to their you know the refineries of their Arch Enemy Mark Rich became famous by pioneering oil trading and sold Iranian oil to Israel uh this is this is nothing new right it's just the mechanisms of those transactions will become more technologically updated as time goes on I think crypto will be part of that there's again nothing Sinister about this this is just about keeping the lights on it's interesting it's just how it's just how it goes yeah and I mean it makes sense because one you know one thing I keep coming back to about crypto and this is something that struck me at token token 2049 is when you're discussing with people what is the value of crypto what does blockchain Tech enable what is bitcoin enable what is ethereum enable what do all these things actually do I just keep coming back to the fact that it allows you to transfer value more efficiently and better than you you ever have before and so if you start with if you just start with that base now then you have to ask yourself when you're building applications or when you're building things what is most impacted by that framework what types of things can you build what types of things can get done that are most impacted by the ability to move value in a digital way easily and more simply than we ever have before International Trade obviously obviously one of them you joined great Market trade obviously is a big is a big part of that big part of that as well and I think we all just have to be realistic about what the technology is used for another one one thing that stood out to me is I was staying or the the conference was in the Marina Bay Sands which is this big Casino yeah tell us tell us about token 2049 like what was the mood like there like if people like me are leaving crypto then well not leaving but leaving it professionally then there's we must be it we must be at the lows you know like it's about to rip from here so what was the mood like yeah it's a Jonas over you you said you you bought the top and sold the bottom basically sorry at least at least at least you didn't leave at 15K that would have been that would have been very painful Heath went down to 950 on my watch yeah yeah you stuck it through you stuck it through the actual low so I'll get you know I'll get I'll give it to you but it was electric it was there was a lot of energy the issue was I didn't see as many projects as I would look like to and the projects that I did see uh you know there's things like Islam coin which doesn't really make too much sense to me it's like ethical you know Halal Finance right I mean a lot of these things just didn't really resonate with me and and I think that there was still there's still clearly a lot of money I think Jonah they were they were a thousand booths at this place whoa there were a lot of people there are those guys just spending 2021 VC cash are they are they I think so I think so and I think what's what's going to be good is that you know I think there's still a culling ahead if I were to take a wild guess I'd say they're still calling ahead in the VC market and the VC Market always lags the liquid Market I think the liquid Market has broadened out I think the VC Market has some some ways some ways to go but I'll I'll say that the mood of the investors was electric and the thing that stood out to me is that I spend a lot of my time in New York I spend you know a lot of my time in Puerto Rico I spent a lot of my time in the US in general and the level of sophistication from investors into crypto is quite low compared to the level of sophistication coming from investors in Hong Kong and Singapore specifically Singapore I sat down probably with you know 10 15 different allocators at the time that were all Asia based that you know had one foot in crypto one foot out of crypto maybe they bought a little bit in 2021 and got absolutely nuked maybe they you know didn't actually acquiesce and managed to save their cash but a lot of these guys were still hovering around crypto but they knew a lot they were very interested in crypto and interested in a way that people in the U.S they just really aren't and and a lot of these guys I think what's happened is you have a lot of these young guys that are maybe 25 to 40 years old and they're the sons or Daughters of these magnates that have made a substantial amount of money in real estate in commodities really just across the board and they want to make a name for themselves and they've found crypto and they really like it and they really get it and so they they try to get these carve outs to go invest in and you talk to these people and they're just quite knowledgeable and when we talk to people in the U.S it's it's night and day I mean these guys are asking me questions like what is bitcoin and the family offices out in Asia are asking me what the best ZK evm implementation is right it's just a very different level of interest and another thing that was pointed out to me is that what is the best just hot take what is the best ZK evm level implementation Okay so we spent a lot of time on this last year my gut based on understanding last year's report and then talking a lot with the different teams right now is it polygon as far ahead so polygon bought Hermes uh I think in 21 might have been 22 for 400 million and I was lucky enough to be at a lunch actually the Cumberland Center with Daniel Schwartz the founder of Hermes Sandeep and Miguel and I'd say Daniel Schwartz is a very very very very smart guy uh you know kind of reminds me a little bit of italic in that sense and I have a lot of faith that the polygon team is actually going to roll out a very robust solution and they're about 18 months ahead of everybody else well and the other thing the other thing that's interesting optimism has a hundred million dollar Grant now or pushing on 100 million dollar grant for uh ZK uh as it's a ZK Grant to go build TK tech for for optimism because everybody knows that the roll-up optimistic Roll-Ups are a stop Gap and they're not going to be the main form of uh you know so the main the main solution over the next call it to even two three two three years so everybody's trying to to get on on top of this and so I actually think polygon is quite under owned from that perspective you know they sold 180 million dollars of Nike nfts uh that people aren't really paying attention to the Starbucks nft implementation didn't go that well uh a lot of the other basically every other L1 uh and and now nl2 has had to do a tremendous amount of incentivization in order to keep activity High and if you look at polygon activities just still quite High you know the number two in nfts um people are still using people are still using the platform and actually can't incentivize uh which is which is a bearish point because they just they just don't really have a token left to incentivize I think their token economics make more sense then then optimism and an arbitrum token economics do and I think that Sundeep is a genuinely dedicated founder and that's actually quite rare these days and the polygon token has been around long enough that he could have pulled out a couple hundred million and just walked away and said that's good and he hasn't I mean he he's still like every day it's funny you know I spent a non-trivial amount of time chatting with him over the last you know few weeks and and he's been he's been impressive every time with his level of dedication so I was like okay I like I like I like polygon you know the market seized look I'm a Trader I'm a Trader I will you know say say that if polygon goes to uh if polygon goes to a buck my position size is going to be much less than it is today um you know just just by virtue of it I mean the market seized on their mistakes right like they they had some Biz Dev successes the token ripped then they had some Biz Dev um embarrassments the token puked um I think this is the problem with or possibly uh opportunity with crypto is that uh unlike standard startup life where the price of the equity in a company you know private company doesn't just like have this transparency and and you can't see the wild volatility as they go from success to failure to success like you have that with crypto because these tokens are so liquid and tradable so uh ultimately I think I think you're right I think there is an opportunity in polygon now base the L2 run by coinbase yep um they're doing 200k a week in revenues um is that a is that a ZK roll up what what powers that no I'm asking for a friend by the way I know the answer but I'm just asking you yeah yeah I know it's optimistic it's it's based on the op stack it's basically an up to Ultimate optimistic uh or op side chain Right aerob Fork is basically what it is and in theory some of the revenues will go back we'll go back to optimism I do think it's very tenuous and I think the one thing that worries me about the optimism value accrual is that there was a balance sheet deal uh coinbase got I think two two and a half percent of the optimism Supply for going with optimism and so I I used to view it I was a little bit more bullish on the optimism stack because of that but post I think that was a very expensive trade for optimism uh and it's unclear whether they'll be able to get future BD Partners on board to get back sequence of revenues in the in the same way but I do like the team I think they're very dedicated I think that they're very smart I think that they're approaching it in the right way and I do think The Branding is very good right to have optimism be able to get World coin and base online I think that base it remains to be seen how long the organic traction is gonna is gonna stay up but it is going to be in my opinion the place when retail comes back where activity happens and that's just purely because it's going to be very easy to get people over from coinbase to base right if you if you want to if you want to enter the crypto ecosystem and you have money you're probably coming in through coinbase anyway and then coinbase also by the way they're launching this offshore derivatives Exchange right um I'm I'm also very okay it's like two things I'm very bullish on polygon and coin those are two things and and you know over the next over the next call it four to eight weeks I think a lot of the this starts to be understood and priced in um one other thing by the way just as a just as another uh point that came out during token 2049 uh so Asian investors a lot more in better equipped to deal with crypto than U.S investors you have a dearth of projects but still a lot of capital in the in in the in the system but the projects that are good are pretty damn good now so for example telegram is rolling out their Wallet app and their wallet is very good it's like actually quite good they're games on the on on the on telegram now telegram has a history of launching phenomenal products like surprises the telegram wallet is good it's a good wallet telegram operates under this ethos so Steve Jobs has this famous business quote that was in his autobio or his biography um very recommended by the way the Walter Isaacs and Steve Jobs biography now is this is this the same guy that's writing a book on Elon yeah that's right I mean most cliche recommendation ever but it's it's a fantastic look basically Steve Jobs's thing was you don't have to like and reinvent the wheel um he said just take a product that other people are doing poorly and do it well he did that with the MP3 player right you had these like shitty um basically computer chip surrounded by cheap plastic uh you know very hard to use and he made the iPod so I think telegram has taken that quote and just run with it like they were they were they're still the slickest messaging service right and why shouldn't they be the ones to build the slickest wallet and frankly like there's a for for the Builders out there if there's a dearth of products in crypto uh it's well it's not that there's a dearth of products in crypto it's that there's a dearth of great products in crypto there are a lot of great ideas that are being executed poorly like I you know we talked about this on a previous episode we both love friend Tech but it looks like Windows 95 like can't somebody just show up and do that right I I don't understand what's so difficult about this um so like if you're looking if you're interested in blockchain technology and you're looking to build a a product like just just look at the top hundred products guaranteed that 90 of them are good ideas that are being executed horrendously and just just do well with a good ux and I think you have a you know and then then you could probably bootstrap something interesting yeah it's funny how often people ask me people that don't have telegram but I'll spend two seconds on this because I think everybody listening uses it so I'm not going to show it but they go why do why do you need another messaging happen I said just download it just look it'll be very obvious very quickly why why you want your telegram it's just so much better than every messaging have ever but the wallet's bullish which makes me also kind of bullish the token with the token ripped so hard and it was so inside our front run um I do think that you probably see a 25 30 billion dollar evaluation for this thing people maybe hire I think I know definitely higher I think you get 50 to 50 to 70. valuation on this thing which is about I think uh 8X on the token right now so you know I I'm I'm uh I'm I'm a buyer basically anywhere below one you know two dollars 150. um I probably I'll probably just start loading loading up on this thing it's okay so out of uh uh and the telegram wallet is is opt you like it's not opt-in it's if you're an international IE non-us.com you just have you you have it you have to opt out right yeah and and it's going to be one of the tabs right on the bottom you see chat you see settings it's just going to be one of the tabs right yeah um so I'm I'm you know I'm quite I'm quite bullish on that product the other thing me too I mean like it's the same thing that we were talking about Commodities earlier in in the year like I could see a world in five years where if you're you know subsistence farmer in Bolivia uh and you bring something to you know from from your farm to a local market um maybe you're hap maybe at that point you're happy to accept some telegram coin instead of uh you know local currency because it's just easier and more seamless and you don't have to deal with the bank or a userious middleman like I I you know it's not inconceivable that in five years or ten years time uh the frictionless nature of crypto has disintermediated various micro economies within the worlds let's call it bottom 100 Fiat economies I yeah I would 100 agree with that I kind of it makes me kind of wonder how many people live in venmo or PayPal as opposed to living in bank accounts growing up that many because it's so U.S focused but I mean I know one scammer who lives in in PayPal but um I would say I would say outside of the US is where you get things like that like Bitcoin is probably or even eth is probably a great way for people to to transfer value around for services and goods delivered um in places like India Lebanon in fact like my old shop VTOL like we would sell gasoline to Lebanon um maybe we could have gotten a better price if we sold it to them and accepted tether which they're clearly holding a lot of right now who know who knows were they I wonder if that's something that you would you would explore today yeah it would it would be it would be smart too that that's for sure because I know they use it maybe sell oil to Argentina and usdt yeah but most of it but uh when you sell oil to somebody who are you selling oil to the government um if you're selling oil to somebody you're either selling it to a government entity like a like uh in China you have companies that are like quasi-sovereign that buy oil for their strategic petroleum Reserve or you could if you're selling oil usually there's only one type of customer it's a Refinery like oil in and of itself is not useful um uh Native Americans you know 150 200 years ago used it to make tar to put together canoes but that's pretty much the only use you have to refine it in order to turn it into all the useful stuff that we we know and love oil for so when you're selling oil you're selling it to a Refinery making canoes is a real business yeah I I you don't seem like much of a canoer to me I'm not now I'm more of a kind if I if I were I mean we could start the Thousand X canoe I'll Row the left or you know we could just start selling merge yeah the first time I don't know I'm sure you could sell a branded canoe maybe we can start with a fate like a small one and then actually scale it up you listening block works stuff damn it we have so we probably have to give them a cut taking our money taking our good canoe to our money that's okay we'll live speaking of speaking of making money when do you think this uh you're you're now you're now my resident macro guy yeah what when did when do you think the market takes a turn right now it's actually looking kind of nasty I think crypto is going to take a turn when all these ETFs land like I think you talk about when earlier you're talking about retail getting involved um I think retail will get involved on chain after the price appreciates and they look at their coinbase account and it's it's you know ballooned again kind of like in 2020-21 type thing so I think the ETFs are going to bring in a ton of money having worked at Cumberland I saw just how important a secure Gateway is and there just aren't many secure gateways in in the world in this post FTX world so an ETF is as secure a Gateway as you're going to get for retail investors all over the world uh and institutional as soon as those things land um you tell me the time frames with that that's going to bring price appreciation and then the follow-on effect will be um sort of user on chain adoption nfts all that sort of secondary and tertiary price action but in terms of macro what What will what will make macro rally uh I think we're priced to Perfection at the moment I think there's a real risk that Commodities create another supply side inflationary shock and so I would not be if I were a tactical Trader um in the equities Market I would not be adding beta exposure which means which is sort of like uh jargon for I would wait for a dip to buy the S P ETF or the S P future what do you think yeah I I think that's I think I think that's fair I think that my my view is that any any bitcoin price below 26k is a good price and I'm buying I'm buying basically all the way down to down to 22. I think you just wanna you just want to accumulate Bitcoin heading into the having heading into rate cuts uh heading into heading into next year I think what's clear to me is that they're just without the traditional markets puking out much more which by the way they definitely could I mean if you look at NASDAQ and you look at the s p they don't look pretty um but and I think I think the the uh there's there's a lot of room for repricing solely because people are so confident that we're going to get a soft landing and we're I think one of the reasons that we're going down is it's we're getting a more balanced approach in that in that opinion and people are pricing in the probability of recession a little bit more so I think there's some way to go I don't think Bitcoin gets below 22 I think if it does that's a gigabyte um you know that's like a I'm gonna get eighty percent of my net worth long that 22. um and basically you're just you're just you're just I thought I was Mr PA crypto investor now that's that's a statement because I I I just see the the demand from the ETF originally as as I think I've talked about on previous podcast is going to be negative you're going to get some outflows from gbted but then over the long term it's just going to be so obviously positive and I think the 2024 sets up very nicely uh for both uh the one thing that I basically have no interest in Touching is all coins for now um yeah I I just I just don't really see I'm with you 100. I I would touch them at this at this at this moment I think that they're definitely idiosyncratic coins it can do well I mean you can make some money you can make some money with frontec and potentially I might buy some relevant if robot gets to like eight cents you know or maybe uh maybe five five to five to eight cents because I do I do genuine I do genuinely believe that yeah crypto one of the killer use cases for crypto is building a Global Casino and I want to bet on global casinos using crypto um so you know I I I I like I like rollback from that from that perspective I don't love it from uh from a few others but we'll we shall see I'm with you on all coins I think the um you know I think that altcoins have been so uh destructive to Value over the course of the last year and a half that destructive just to to the you know the the financial value of people's accounts institutional and Retail that you're not going to have an altcoin-led rally in crypto you're not going to have a scenario where it's like oh crap I I wish I was in coin number 73 instead of Bitcoin and eth because it just rallied so hard and led the whole Market higher it's not going to happen like all coins are going to give you a chance to get back in I think first Bitcoin and ether going to go during the next rally and then you're gonna have that sort of like moment of silence where it's like hey is this real uh if you know and if you think so then you can sort of go down your menu of all coins and start buying and I think that the menu at that time will be very different than how the menu looks today so I think it pays to wait I think you will have an opportunity as a retailer Institutional Investor to to sort sort of to sort of uh you know like wait for all coins to catch up they're just that market has just been too beaten up for it to correlate with the next Bitcoin rally um and furthermore I you know I caused some controversy on Twitter with this I I'm I think it's okay to give up on a lot of of all coins right now like just what do you mean by that give up like I you know I don't want to go through a hit list or anything but I think it's altcoins is not an asset class within crypto anymore like most of it is just dead and then they're like very specific projects that may outperform you know I think altcoins has a catch-all phrase should just be removed from the Lexicon of crypto people um like we could we could call it like the 21 basket or the 17 Basket of like things that performed during those bull cycles we could refer to those specific baskets but altcoins is a universe that's too large to to discuss uh concisely in in sort of a uh you know profit accumulating way 99.9 percent of coins that aren't Bitcoin and eth are worthless right so that that's sort of what I mean I think uh I think we have to be a lot more careful about our usage of the term altcoin yeah I I I'd agree I'd agree with that I mean the the thing is that there are things up there that can still do quite well um okay so here's here's an example I think that dot is effectively worthless me too I think it's completely worthless shorting it costs 30 a year yeah I mean if there were an efficient way to short it it would already be worth zero and it is a fully diluted valuation is 5.5 billion how nuts how nuts is that how long do you think it's going to take to cut that annihilation in half might take a while if I were a DOT holder I would sell and if I didn't want to sell for some insane reason I would lend it to a seller like that's what I would do yeah but I mean you can get I think the staking rate is is pretty high and so that people are just taking it staking it instead um but yeah I mean it's it's like how long do we think that it takes for this for this to for this to reprice probably probably takes a while once told me tokens don't file for bankruptcy right it's kind of true well that's that's the that's the unfortunate nature of it is that they don't and so when you're thinking as a Trader I think you have to think a lot about the you know the positioning of your of of other of other people in this it's like okay well I know let's say you want to get short a worthless asset like Doc or Cordon I was like well I know that this thing is probably going to be worth less than two years but I think that's the time frame that you have to take yeah but so am I if I sell the perp and pay 30 a year just to get yeah exactly exactly so it's it's it's it's tough which is why I don't love shorting I don't like I don't love value shorting in crypto I like mean aversion shorting when you get like pumps and things like World coin that are ridiculous or things on like bch that pump uh I don't yeah but tough uh to love value shorting in crypto in a bear Market where you should be shorting a lot of stuff that has been proven worthless because of Market structure issues and you can't get short things efficiently SO trading anything that isn't like a major in a bear Market becomes so difficult and then obviously those environments call a lot of people from crypto myself included and then you know what's left is the you know the Savvy investors who have navigated those bear markets when the next bull market occurs and you know I I would bet on you Avi um to be the guy to find those next points I mean you mentioned friend Tech friend Tech I think is one of the most interesting that despite in spite of itself in spite of having one of the most lackluster user experiences I've ever seen in any technology product in the last 15 years um it's so cool all right Jonah it was a pleasure all right dude catch up soon great talking see you later [Music] foreign

I think that if you're not paying attention you're you're going to be missing out on a big trap this is one of those things that goes mainstream and ultimately I think it's genius and I'm I'm refreshed by it this is a perfect use case for crypto [Music] we're back welcome to another episode of thousand X we're happy to have you finally we get some volatility it's been boring as hell this entire summer effectively since we hit 32k and we finally got finally got some ball Bitcoin Bitcoin traded down ended up breaking down from that 30k range to 26. and now we're teetering here on the edge and a lot of arguments to be bullish a lot of arguments to be bearish but Jonah where's your head I mean we were literally we were literally just trying to come up with ways to stay awake this summer and then bang right 15 sell-off um I would say that when I look at Price action like this it makes me nervous and I think it could go a lot lower um just total finger in the air like watch watching it like nervously stabilize around 26 but if you go and pull up the open interest levels and you look at how much length was liquidated over the course of this sell-off um the picture looks really clean so I I despite being a crypto bowl and feeling nervous about length right now I think this is a time to buy with both hands I think that if you have dry powder and hopefully you do you're supposed to be adding meaningfully here I think what happened is a lot of participants got long or even levered long ahead of the anticipated uh gbtc versus SEC decision last week I think the market was expecting the judge to come down in favor of gbt or a grayscale rather and then nothing happened and maybe a bit of cascaded liquidations as people just exited positions so I think all of that weak length is gone and I think it's it's a clean slate that you're supposed to buy yeah I'd agree with that the only the only reason why it would be slightly more hesitant is if I believe that the equity markets were in trouble I think September is going to be macro podcast season unfortunately I really I really enjoyed my break not listening to any macro podcast and not really paying attention discount is a macro podcast I no because we're not opining on macro the entire time we're talking about some other I do think that some of it like listen listen to an hour-long podcast on inflation is very tedious in my opinion because I uh people people just tend to tend to repeat themselves and like once you've heard the same argument once you you hear it again but I do think that it's it's important to start paying attention again I do think that equities provided you a period of time to flip from bull to bear so if you actually look at go go to a trading view whatever charting software you enjoy pull up Bitcoin and then overlay coin and overlay mstr and you'll see that both coin and MST are nuked before Bitcoin nuked so and when I say nuked I don't mean they were down three percent I mean they genuinely nuked hard 10 15 percent right as Bitcoin was ranging which gave you some indication as to where the interest is in the market and the interest was not in crypto and there's a lot of alpha in that statement like I I don't trade like that I I try to trade a around a core position uh I think that anybody out there who you know is in crypto probably a bit bullish crypto um who had the guts or the courage to get short tactically short in this summer doldrums period playing for this dip is a truly lucky or truly talented person but that that is interesting what you bring up like I I I disagree with that I think that it was prudent once you got once you got that move up to 30. so we were ranging for a long time yeah once you got that move up to 30 and you rejected and then you got equities nuking and Bitcoin was still above 29. that was a chance to at least protect yourself that was a chance to say okay well you know this is two weeks ago when we recorded the Pod we were trading up uh we tagged 30 I said that I was bullish and then we rejected and then we traded basically four or five days sideways and during that four five day sideways period coin was nuking mstr was nuking all these other things were nuking hard and I view those as indications of institutional interest in the asset class and so what you were sort of holding on to is you were saying okay well we knew we know that there isn't enough buying power to get us above above 30 right now we got rejected we know that there seemed to be institutions and other holders exiting through coin and MST are pretty pretty aggressively and so given the fact that you have a pretty reasonable stop out above you know call it 30.2 30.4 makes sense just you know start to start to protect yourself that's also one reason why podcasting is you know for all the listeners out there it's it's very important to take into account why somebody is saying the thing that they're that they're saying so that you can and what I try to do is I try to lay it out very clearly so that when you hear my when you hear my viewpoint you understand why it might change and you can factor that in because we do only do this once every two weeks and obviously as an invest as a Trader sometimes my bull bear takes will change day to day depending on new information that I get and that that Jonah gets you just sort of have to have to update information but I will say that once we didn't get above 30 and then you get I I would honestly you know if you're if you're trying to directionally trade Bitcoin over two over two week time period or three time period make sure you have coin mstr Bitcoin miners uh on your watch list because I do think that they are actually reasonably predictive in certain scenarios so bitcoin's ranging sideways and it's sort of a low it's a low volume time period you can actually catch those inflict inflections of demand and Supply I think through those pieces of equity so that's just something that I find particularly valuable that's interesting do you find it do you find it valuable when both Bitcoin and the the minor stocks plus coinbase plus mstr are trending in the same direction do you find that no the equities are useful or is it only when btc's range bound and the equities basically BTC range bound I'm trying to pick a direction okay so this is our our equities stronger weak this is critical right like you you listen to podcasts all the time and you get pulled up or paired up on the basis of what the podcasters are saying I think Avi what you're trying to mention here that that I think is important um and you hear about on a trading floor all the time is process right like what what is your like do you have a process for arriving at a trading or risk decision and is it is the process consistent or improving throughout time yeah um yeah like what I hate is when people say oh you can use hey great you can use equities to trade Bitcoin in these sometimes they're predictive okay when how yeah like how are like okay what are you gonna do great msdr's up five percent today what does that tell you well it doesn't tell you anything in context unless or it doesn't tell you anything unless you put it in context okay so the only place I've found it valuable is when bitcoin's going sideways and it needs to pick a direction and you're trying to figure out what direction it's going to pick that is the only scenario that I've actually found Bitcoin equities or crypto equities useful in terms of Bitcoin uh predictive see that's that's interesting I I hadn't thought of that and like what I was thinking when I was watching miners in coinbase um during this sort of slower summer for crypto was okay crypto's not moving but the miners in coinbase have just gassed higher to you know local highs right all right now they're retracing a little bit whatever from local highs they were you know decorated from Bitcoin on the way up maybe they'll be decorated on the way down they weren't de-correlated I mean they actually one thing that I will say I'm just going to pull up the chart we're not trying to take for tick though dude like they're like Bitcoin literally didn't move for a few weeks pretty pretty darn close I mean they topped very on a very similar day yeah it wasn't it wasn't exactly uh on on the day that Bitcoin traded 32 but they basically talked on the day that Bitcoin traded 32. okay when you have the things that you look at in the market what I try to do a lot is place them into very specific contexts and then start to Overlay right so for example one thing that you can look at is breaking the 200 moving average well what's more important sometimes people talk about breaking the 200 moving average to the upside sometimes people talk about breaking it breaking it to the downside you actually want to study on that is it more predictive of momentum breaking it to the upside or breaking it to the downside it's actually a very easy problem I'll leave it to the Leave It To The Listener to to decode but these types of things right so sectioning off okay well instead I'm just gonna I'm gonna look at this indicator but in what context does that does this thing work and what context does it not work and then you start to piece together now I actually have a notion we have all these different rules of things that I look at and where I see them tend to work and where I see them tend to fail and then I use them I like I'll review them I'll take a look and then I'll try to apply them to the current market and I'll say do I do any of these apply right now what's what's important it's interesting right I mean I have a slightly different process honed from tradfy which is that so basically the process that you just described or any process for the listeners it's something that you can cling to when you're losing money it is an objective framework that helps you from stopping out of positions when they're temporarily not going your way that's why you need to have a process that's sort of somewhat static throughout time uh otherwise you're just going to be buying on the way up and selling on the way down and and chopping yourself up so I did that for a period of time in my career when I made the excruciating transition from Market maker working at a bank to um Avi Feldman style prop Trader working on the buy side uh I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits and I had to stop myself from day trading without a framework um I I was I was just sort of blowing in the wind and I I screwed up quite badly and almost got myself fired a couple of times before you know on a last-ditch effort I had to develop a process and that process for me like I like to take a call it a six month to a two year view on my asset class and find ways to hang on to that because I'm usually pretty right over the long run but over the short run on the time frames that you're talking about Avi I'm pretty weak I'm not a very good Trader so what I did was I I basically put a yellow sticky on my monitor that said do not trade do not day trade unless you have back tested your strategy um so I had that on my monitor for years yeah well I'll say that that that's an important part right it's not just that's part of the processor it's like okay well you have these certain situations that pop up can you quantify them yeah okay so there you go what's your what's your hit rate on the on these types of things I mean a lot of trading is just coming up with strategies that you sometimes will organically observe then you'll go to your Quan if you have a Quant or maybe you are your Quant and you say hey okay how do I how do I put this into a framework that is repeatable so for example is there Alpha if the you have two correlated assets arbitrum and optimism if arbitrum if optimism's up eight percent if the arbitrum optimism pair is up a certain amount will there be mean reversion right at some point and how much does that have to blow out before mean aversion starts to start to kick in it's like okay well maybe it's if it's up eight percent maybe it's ten percent maybe it's 15 right it's like okay well now once you get to 15 20 maybe you're at a you know three standard deviation over the last if it's up 20 over the last two weeks maybe at a three standard deviation Type move and mean reversion is gonna gonna probably gonna probably kick in there right and then you start to quantify these things and you start to you start to tag them and you start to look for them I think there are a lot of idiots there's a lot of idiosyncratic upside for Doge and there's a lot of idiosyncratic downside for bch that's not a mean reversion thing that's just a secular Trend right that's but yeah but that that's just uh that's just slightly different but um no it's like these these can can you juice Alpha in these types of certain situations right where you have I mean on those you have the dog potentially dying unfortunately which is which is bullish for it you have I think elon's launching a rocket with the Doge on it tune Elon rebranding the accent on bch you have a completely manufactured pump that sent that to 240. if you can find an efficient way to get short altcoins like bch there are a lot of those trades like long they're a lot short polka dot is another one but like good luck getting short polka dot right it's without like waking up one morning and while you were asleep realizing that the perp blew out to like negative 200 apy funding for a couple cycles and ate up all of your p l right it's these markets are inefficient so hugely one thing that I really like by the way when it comes to so you'll get these scam pumps from things like bch from things like Aptos from things like sui that tend to uh be characterized a lot by perp volumes blowing out uh by a random spot bed that's appeared for nowhere by a tremendous amount of open interest and you'll get you know bch from like 120 to 240 for example it's like okay well well how do you how do you think of how do you think about shorting that and where do you think if you're going to short how do you think about shorting that what I tend to do is I tend to wait for a period where it's off 20 or so from from the highs it bounces and then it retraces back that back down to that 20 from highs and then that that's when you normally want to want to short it is when the bounce when a Bounce has failed and one of those scan pumps is when you 10 20 it's just arbitrary yeah it's sort of arbitrary oh sorry here's a part that's not that's not arbitrary then the question is well where do you where do you tend to want to close it because sometimes you you get caught in these situations where it'll start going back up and so where does it normally start to go back up is kind of the interesting point let's use an example of an asset that goes up let's go go from 100 to 200 it goes down to 180 and then it goes back up to 195 and then back down to 180 okay great that's your trigger point you're gonna short 180. where do you close do you close at 100 well no you don't and the reason is that where you think fundamental value should ultimately be you know not not fundamental value but where the risk reward makes sense for other traders to come step in because this Market trade especially these types of things tend to trade very technically and so let's say the top of the pump 200 bottom of the pump 100 you've shorted 180 and it trades it trades to 1 150. well at that point you have to think about what other what what are other people seeing in this chart how are other people seeing the Sasa trade they see 150 and what they see is that there's a stop out below 100 where the scan pump began and there's a target of 200 where the scampum ended so the risk reward is about equal and so they're probably not that many people that are gonna that are gonna step in there but at 140 that that starts to become a little bit more interesting right so you see people that will look at a chart like that they'll say okay if I buy 140 then I can stop out 100 and Target 200 my risk award starts to look a little bit better I see what you mean and then at 133 it's two to one and generally two to one is where I find people in crypto like to step in when they see those when they see those types right so double your risk risk one to make two see in Trad five some of these things that that do that pump like crazy actually have fundamentals like for example the March April natural gas spread March is the last month of winter when natural gas is in high demand in the United States and April is sort of the first month of spring when natural gas is abundant and there's not like you know it can't get really squeezed by too much demand and not enough Supply so that March April time spread usually it's worth like 30 cents in mmbtu at an extreme usually 20 cents but you know I remember back in 2018 during some crazy winter like polar vortex thing in America it pumped up to two dollars and that was the craziest thing that anybody had ever seen you know billions of dollars of capital were lost on this and the whole time the thing was worth like 20 or 30 cents but it went up to two dollars which is crazy and it kind of feels a bit like crypto when it's trading up there like what is like how do you know why wouldn't it go to ten dollars you know it's like oil and gas during the Ukraine war could oil go to 500 a barrel if Russia like starts war with the West sure um but like you know you don't know how high it's going to go but you know that fundamental value is probably a lot lower than the current price and so when you when you say that something's quote scam pumping in crypto like theoretically your fair value for bch is is what um zero right like what do you what do you actually think that token is worth no before you answer just like I I take your point about people wanting to come in and get long because it just traded up and this is a little bit different than a commodity or a commodity spread that has like physical end users that will ultimately drive fair value to fundamentals but like at the same time when I when I think about these things like usually the way that I look at it is a little bit different it's not like oh 20 off the highs or oh where would someone take the other side it's literally like go to wikipedia.com type in Kelly Criterion like calculate how much money I can afford to lose before I get fired or get divorced or whatever it is and uh and then how much how much money is that Jonah no comment but at the same time um you know usually you usually you just it's a function of your dry palette when you go into these like technical no price makes sense every price makes sense markets um I I use the Kelly Criterion like a half Kelly yeah I think I think that's fair I mean look yes my long-term value for bch is probably zero that being said the crypto markets are let me let me put this in the nicest way possible are influenced by a lot of factors that have nothing to do with fundamentals and often it's easy to to change the pricing of these assets are the same way but but like over the short run that's true over the long run the fundamentals always win when you see evidence of something moving for inorganic reasons and the inorganic reasons can often be a spot bid that's come out of nowhere a very very sharp price movement on an illiquid coin a large increase in open interest on Futures contracts that correspond with a large move in price you know normally more than 30 30 to 40 percent and then you see the drivers of that move start to disappear that's when you take this type of dream that I like that is something right like you just talk that's very concrete it's okay well maybe I was watching the coinbase binance spread and for the last week this asset has had the coin coinbase above binance and it was going up and now it stopped going up and binance is above coinbase maybe that's your trigger or open interest went up a ton and it went up 40 50 percent it's no longer going up and open interest is starting to come down maybe that's your trigger now where do you how do you short that thing what I just talked about where do you cover what I just talked about right that's more so Avi what you're talking about is kind of like a pioneering framework in crypto for what most people would call quantimental trading like the input would be the coinbase binance spread for a certain token or open interest and enterprising listeners should be taking notes on everything Avi just listed out and you know back testing them back testing just how what is the lead like the words that come out of my mouth what is the lead lag like tweet tweet at us like what is the lead lag relationship between the coinbase finance spread for Doge and the price of Doge is there one uh you know these are these are cool little quantimental factors that you could use to build a systematic strategy and you can also pull I mean there are all sorts of random things that affect the price of crypto time zone is huge and time zone correlated with price spread between exchanges is great so for example when finances in the lead you tend to get better price action during Asia hours when coinbase is in the lead you tend to get better price action during Us hours and you can start to oh okay well how do I take advantage of that and then it's not just Bitcoin because bitcoin's efficient it's all these other coins out there that okay well when does when does Litecoin when is when is it best performing uh time for for Litecoin go figure that out right now okay great you have a strategy now congratulations let's go make some money I think we should debate the friend Tech app that just launched um I have read about it but not used it you have actually gotten yourself on there yes let me let me see I I guess maybe we should try and just debate this and and like I'll attempt to pick it apart I for the record I think it's cool and I think it's it's worth something but like I could pretend for a minute that I think it's I could be a crypto skeptic about it and we I get personally offended when people sell my shares yeah so if you sell my shares I will be I will see it and I will be upset about it and I will I don't think I can threaten people on this podcast so I will be very upset with you you're one of the most unthreatening podcasters out there Avi got no tattoos oh oh all right are you kidding I don't know if you know this but you know I used to you know I used to cage fight right really yeah I'm not gonna challenge you to a cage fight I could I could like I wrestled I wrestled in high school a little bit in college oh really yeah I played cello call me call me non-threatening again cool room come on play cello and say it in my face Jonah so friend tech let's say that I am a novice sort of aspiring day trader um I read crypto Twitter I follow a few influencers I could theoretically buy those influencers shares on friendtech and get invited into private conversations with those influencers in which I theoretically might be able to learn something about the market that could help me do a better job profiting from it Trading um is that sort of a correct interpretation of how friend Tech might work uh yeah I think I think that's a reasonable I mean I think that's reasonable I mean the the way the way that I would think about it is it the financialization of people is inevitable given the technology that we currently have why does okay so again just devil's advocate here why does this need to be a crypto thing it's just it's just the it's just the easiest way to transfer value on the internet I think we both agree with that yeah okay if if you're gonna have value transfer on the internet crypto is the best way to do it okay so I agree that people will eventually be financialized I agree that crypto is the best way to you know transfer value on the internet so we're in agreement there um but there's a difference between financializing people and transferring that value around on the internet and what friendtech does which is allow like basically selling access uh to those people uh in in the form of uh sort of a private messaging Channel um don't you think that seems a bit uh potentially dangerous and valueless like for example if we were trying to um say hey we're going to have a private sort of invite-only version like paid version of the Thousand X podcast where we you know do what we don't do on this podcast which is offer investment advice and help give you you know tips or whatever like that's not something that I believe retail would be able to profit from I wouldn't feel good about doing that um I don't think it works I think everybody has to have their own investment process to our to the point that we were talking about earlier in our conversation I don't think you can just sort of follow somebody else's trades and expect that to work for you you can invest in their fund and that works sometimes but you know in the case of you know profitable funds of course it works but like for oh get invited into this Channel and we'll tell you what what to do like do you think that's actually beneficial to retail is that an actual use case that works yeah the way okay so there's sort of two there's sort of two things here right the first is is it is it beneficial to have monetary value assigned to access and I think yeah 100 that's how basically everything in the world works is there can you give an example you pay you you if you want to go to a club and you're a dude you buy a table if you want to go get lunch with Warren Buffett you pay five million dollars if you want uh to have a better chance of getting into your MBA you pay an MBA counselor like 30k to help you with your application there are all sorts of different examples in life just you want access to some I mean you know there was uh there was that one um biology Ransom company right that he sold to coinbase that was 21. yeah so something oh no it started as 21. it started as the Bitcoin computer and then it switched to earn.com or something like that earn.com exactly and where you would pay to get access to people and I view this as sort of a natural extension of that I I think Jonah the main worry that I have so somebody's gonna short me and then try to like murder me or something like that I mean that's that's really the like that's really the fear I'm being serious well you know how to wrestle you could just put the guy in a full name yeah you can't wrestle a bullet Jonah okay all right you know what you're convincing me that this uh this friend Tech thing works I mean I I sort of believed in it from the beginning but I wanted to try and play Devil's Advocate and as everybody's sort of probably aware by now I'm not very good at arguing for things I don't really agree with so Avi you win this one um no I didn't even argue you know for any any arguments for it I just said that if I just said that it allows people to potentially get murdered for profit which is actually an argument against it I mean the the here's we we actually invested in a platform uh called fan three which allows users it allows artists like a zed for example who's part of the project or Liam Payne or Taylor Swift will use a better example that everybody knows uh that the reason I said Zed and Liam Payne is because they're both part of it but anyway Taylor Taylor Swift that allows her to issue special access nfts to build a website that allows for special access very very easily to also uh basically it's like a it's like a suite of tools to allow that has some web 3 components some not web3 components that allows the artist to engage more directly with their fans and people are happily paying for this for for this right and so it it's what it's one of those things where I think people are willing to go pay for access to people that they view as important or useful or good or fun people are willing to pay for access to people that they people that they idolize I think that there's also a gambling element to this where it's you're not only paying for Access you can resell that access and potentially if you get access to somebody early on you can make a lot of money by betting that this person is going to be huge right I'm sure we've all come across somebody in our life we're like hey I don't know exactly how they're going to be successful but I know that these this person is going to be successful and I want want a piece of that well Frank you're looking at that person right here Avi his name is Jonah van Borg and he was one of the the first hundred viewers or a thousand viewers of Psy's Gangnam Style right before before it really blew up and look at me now I have made a dime after that I haven't made a dime outside yeah and so two thoughts on your your sort of financialization of people and um you know sort of like crypto gives you access to interesting events or or access to those people type type you know conversations uh so thought number one you are the Taylor Swift of crypto Traders Avi just want you to know that you are you are definitely at the top of the at the top of your game you're young and you have a bright future ahead of you thought number two is uh I agree with you I think that crypto is a fantastic and proven way for people to engage with content creators and for that value to be fun and liquid and if you look at friendtech like like it or not it's the the third biggest Revenue generator in the ethereum network right like the the top Revenue generators obviously ethereum mainnet number two is Lido and friendtech is number three right now like people are spending real dollars on this so or Eve really so ultimately you're right and it's being proven in the uh in the pudding but to me I just my only actual point of skepticism about friendtech is that um while I do believe that there is value and access I think that I were like I think that in the in the space that you and I um you know are Professionals in in trading um I think that value is extremely uh dangerous and you need to like it's dangerous you can't just take tips from people and expect that to work for you you know like if I mean if that's what friendship is selling the front Tech is mostly crypto influencers right now so I would be worried like I would think the product would need to uh differentiate between like hey you know backstage tickets to an artist's show or a conversation with Warren Buffett like you know kind of innocuous things like that versus like hey get in a chat room with this like early board ape adopter for you know nft Alpha right yeah I mean I I I look I I agree with you but I think you're painting it unnecessarily narrow hole or narrow picture I think that in about two weeks this thing is going to go mainstream if it it kind of is already there there are a couple of games there are a couple of Gamers that have got it gone on board uh you're right it's still by like mostly crypto by far but I think in give it two to three weeks I I think that people are going to come up with some pretty Innovative things here and I think that the platform itself I think the core thing here so they will inevitably be a financialization of people it started with sports stars right there were platforms out there that uh one of the Theses was hey we'll let you invest in Messi or we'll let you invest in this in this song in this you know high schooler uh who might who might go to the who might go to the NFL and you'll get a cut of a salary if he does and he'll get the money now right there so there are all these different platforms out there uh that tried to do that with sports stars this is just that but at greater scale with a better actual pot of people to potential Investments like social media influencers okay who do you think is going to get who do you think is going to get big uh and not only anything is going to get big but who is going to deliver the most value to the people that sign up for uh to to own their to own their shares right here's a crazy thought imagine instead of buying a concert ticket they just like spin up a account for the concert and the first like thousand people to buy Shares are the only people that go to the that go to the concert yeah it's like so many random things that you can you can you can do with this which is why I actually think that there's a lot of money to be made here and if you're not paying attention to friendtech right now you probably should because even if even if it Flames out it's worthwhile staying on top of the developments because I couldn't agree with you more like I think something like this that's going to succeed and you should have a good understanding of what that something might look like no you're you're absolutely right Avi and I think that like there have been a few iterations of products like this in the past in crypto they kind of fizzled out but that doesn't mean that the technology itself isn't perfectly conducive to this use case and for me it's just refreshing to talk about something other than Pepe or Barack Obama Sonic Harry Potter coin like I'm I'm just sick of that stuff and to me like first of all friendtech has a great name it's slick it's catchy uh financialization of people is a theme that it like you said it you know it's it's a bit dystopian but It ultimately appeals to our um kind of our our sensibilities because of what we've seen happen in our you know in our recent lifetimes with social media followed by crypto followed by you know basically uh financialization of other things so ultimately I agree with you I just might I'm a little scared of it but at the same time I think that if you're not paying attention you're you're going to be missing out on a big Trend this is one of those things that that goes mainstream and ultimately uh I don't necessarily know what the best way to profit from this is as a Trader other than to buy buy shares of people that you think are going to go viral so yeah I guess you have to really maybe maybe the best way to do it would be to like I'm just brainstorming here you build a bot that monitors people who will almost definitely go viral but aren't yet on the platform and the second they go they get on second they on board then you buy that's a brilliant I would bet a million dollars of people are doing that right now yeah like to me I'm just trying to think like how would you there's no people are definitely doing that right now friend Tech I feel like by the time this podcast comes out on Thursday people are going to hear that and they're going to say well just for the record this was filmed on Monday uh if it comes out if it's going to come out on Thursday and people are going to be like everybody's doing that Jonah like I bet I bet actually he's gonna be doing that like for two days yeah so it's not like it's not quite as easy as oh we'll buy the friend Tech token um it's it's a little more nuanced but yeah maybe maybe there's a little bit of alpha in there for people who are willing to invest the time and effort and write a few lines of code yeah I mean it's pretty it's pretty wild I I signed up and people are buying my shares for some reason um should I sign up yeah you should 100 sign up I mean I say for some reason I I actually actually really enjoy the platform I'm probably gonna start doing a lot more with it so I think I think it's genius and I'm I'm refreshed by it this is a perfect use case for crypto all right I think uh I think it's about I think it's about time to wrap this one I appreciate you spending time with me as always Jonah and likewise Avi listening to my rants so it was good I'll see you out there on front deck everyone see you guys out there on front Tech [Music]

it's very clear that the environment for crypto is Shifting right now you have the ETFs you have the stable coin the uh Ripple lawsuit I don't know what's coming next but it's clear that they're green shoots in a way that there weren't prior and that makes me more bullish and so if you were a listener on the last podcast and you heard me waxing bearish I'm changing my tune [Music] alright guys welcome back to the Thousand X show just came back from a nice vacation in in Greece just got to disconnect her a bit catch some octopi sit eat feta cheese and delicious Greeks out on the beach octopi octopi it's for sure octopi I've ever watched my friend the octopus no I haven't maybe another generational thing I yeah no no this is like this is like a Netflix documentary about some South African guy who made friends with an octopus and I think the whole point of the documentary was to try to convince you not to eat them because they're really smart he also sounds smarter than the dude that made friends with a hippo and then got eaten by it no way dude made friends with a hippo that got eaten yeah he was he was like riding it like a unicorn or a horse for a while then one day the hippo is just like enough I don't like you anymore yeah you gotta be careful okay now here it is man mulled to death in South Africa also so what is it with South Africa well animals down there a lot of animals down there yeah I was uh several times describe the hippo as his son um yeah a six-year-old pet hippo he went to swim with him when he goes in the water Humphrey he named him Humphrey allows him to get on his back and ride him like a horse yeah this guy's nuts doing swimming with a hippo these things are you know more people die from hippos a year than die from lions where does the octopus death count factor into that I don't know but there apparently is an octopus called uh what is a blue it's like a blue ring octopus or something like that or is it just spring face when you're underwater and then suffocate you or drown you or something they're extremely venomous they're found in tide pools from Japan to Australia and they are only five to eight inches long they are extremely dangerous if provoked when handled because their venom can kill somebody very easily so have you ever seen octopus with blue rings on it just whatever you do don't touch it sounds like certain altcoins doesn't it not be you know just stay away definitely some that like bold what happened what happened with bald was it wasn't bald Alto blue isn't the logo because bass is is all blue honestly I I did not pay too much attention to to what was going what was going on with bald all I know is that it's just a continuation of every time you get a launch of a new protocol like a base or a sui or an Aptos there's always going to be meme coin and 50 of the time that mean coin's gonna run we're basically you were earlier you were dead that's it in the case of the octopus I think you're just dead then you got to avoid it I don't think as much money to be made on picking up venomous occupy but in terms of all coins you're earlier you're dead and that's the way that's the way that I think about it although there have been two very notable exceptions to this rule one of which uh was Pepe and the other is apparently Harry Potter Obama Sonic Inu 10. which has done remarkably remarkably well uh it actually seems to be holding uh remarkably well um so that's so that's been that that's been kind of Interest interesting to see is that that there there are some that last long enough to be able to create a cult Community around them and then you're good so I kind of disagree with you on Pepe um if you were early you obviously did quite well if you had bought into that sort of early pump you know this the thing was only out for like three days he could have said all right I'm early it's only three days old if you bought it then you'd be down 80 from there um or even if you bought it you know sometime in June you'd still be down 50 so Pepe's had its sell-off I mean look Avi just more broadly speaking this year if you just held BTC or even more intelligently if you'd held gbtc you would have outperformed most discretionary hedge funds right that trade crypto and do research and actually like try to invest a lot of a lot of effort and capital and time you know picking apart the space most so but most but not all I'll just leave it at that yes that is true only the best rise to the top Avi and um loud and podcasting but at the same time you know as somebody who's you know I don't work at a hedge fund in crypto I you know cumberland's a little bit different but I guess the the general approach that I've taken this year has been to sort of dismiss most of the space and focus on the coins eats and Bitcoin with an actual use case and products like and I I go back and forth sometimes I feel smart for doing that and I guess you know this calendar year the price action has confirmed that approach however other times I wonder like hey am I just being lazy here I'm not particularly kicking myself or missing Pepe or that you know Obama coin but um you know maybe I'll miss the next big uh summer of some new some new asset class within the crypto space Just By ignoring all of this what I perceive to be white Mill it's a lot easier to make money on it on a bet on an infrastructure play because you're effectively betting on the index so all of the money that flowed into crypto in 2021 they didn't have the chops to underwrite specific assets and specific applications so what they would do is they would just put all of their money into index plays and index meaning ethereum or Solana or near or Avalanche Matic these effectively you can say all right these are index plays on the applications that are on top of them and that's why they radically outperformed I don't think that's going to be true moving forward over the next five years I do think that in the short term that they're very likely to be still still be true because we're not at the point yet where we're sophisticated enough investors to to really start to parse these things out as an aggregate in the crypto market and so I think L1 still do reasonably well I think we're going to get a spike in Bitcoin dominance over the next month but I do think that then what ends up happening is that it starts at Peter off and the reason is I think that the ETF starts to get really priced in I I don't think okay so I have a slightly different view it's similar but but a bit different basically I don't think the ETF can get priced in until the ETF exists and I I mentioned this on previous podcasts and on Twitter um normally markets price in information well ahead of time uh and that's because you have ample capital and dry powder in the market to price in you know whatever information may be available uh in Bitcoin and East when events are bearish that is certainly the case like plenty of length can come out of the market very quick as we saw last year um you know ahead of ahead of problematic events for the space however length cannot be added easily at this point um you know I I saw some statistics on class node showing that the Longs in Bitcoin which is just an easy asset to pay attention to because of the nature of the blockchain you know I think 65 of them have been held for over a year like the Longs are quite St like like stagnant there's not a lot of fast money coming in and out if you're retail um in the United States it's it's kind of hard to access crypto so you don't have this steady retail info I think an ETF like a BlackRock or an arc ETF Arc by the way their first approval days this Friday we're expecting you know it's it's very likely going to get delayed would be yeah very likely to get delayed like until you have one of those instruments like the capital that you would need to reprice crypto to the the levels where crypto is accessible via an ETF just doesn't exist until the ETF comes in so I think this is one of those very rare opportunities in the market where well-telegraphed information just can't be priced in because the telegraph it's reflects it to use your word up the the well telegraphed event is that a Gateway of liquidity will open at some point so you do kind of have to you have an opportunity to get ahead of it so I I challenge your month I take the over and then I think BTC dominance trickles down from there as uh interest sort of returns to the space but just a question for you on that point you make a very good point about how altcoins will come back in the post xrp Ripple ruling world I agree with you but I don't think it's going to be a 2021 thing where everyone see four if about all altcoins and they they go up like crazy I think you're gonna have things like arbitrum and optimism ethereum based altcoins Rally or output form you know dydx is an eighth-based product um but like what about alt l1s like Solana and nir and some of these other ecosystems could do very well or just die we don't know what do you think my view my view is that they're coming they're they're gonna come back okay I just think that this is sort of a similar conversation that we had last time uh but around big Reid I just think that that's inevitable uh that there's going to be enough greed to agreed to pump these pump these things higher I do want to talk about the Bitcoin ETF for a second it's very possible that the initial out there the initial reaction to the Bitcoin ETF is our outflows from gbtc so a lot of people that have that trade on um people probably end up trying to redeem from gbtc there are a lot of people that have been stuck in that asset for for quite some time and so I do think that it's possible that there's some negative uh no there there's there's an offset to the pure to the pure positive and nine times out of ten what we see is the event marks the top of the trend right I mean basically everything every single time I've seen an event in crypto that's marked the topic people people talked about the ETF in October of 2021 and when it came out that was the literal the Pico top people thought the rumors sell the fact I mean people talked about the coinbase IPO that was within a week of the top in April of 2021. I mean these things tend to get or front run very very very hard billions of dollars in front running that's why I'm not sitting here and I'm saying hey I think that we've topped now because I think that the front running can still occur but what I'm saying is that by the time the event occurs the likelihood that we're going higher post the event is pretty low in my opinion I think people just people just start to people just start to exit at that point and there will always be somebody that says this time is different and the argument that you're going to hear over and over is well it's a spot ETF it's a better product than the future CTF and the reality is that the Futures ETF was a product that people wanted in October of 2021 and prior to that it didn't exist now you if you want access to bitcoin you can go buy long-dated features on on the CME you can buy microstrategy you can buy coin but it is terrible on those long data features though right I mean but you you can you know in a hand Market you pay uh to buy a Futures ETF you pay something like 10 to 12 percent yeah I mean that that part that part's killer killer obviously that that part that that part is the reason why the spot ETF is important in the long run because you can't hold you just can't hold these things no institution is stupid enough to whether 10 to 12 role yields uh from contango like everyone's learned that lesson from The Uso or you know Commodities ETFs it's just it kills you that's why I think the spot ETF is consequential it'll allow you know your your random hedge fund to trade Bitcoin Jonah one thing uh that I was thinking about uh have you uh have you been paying attention at all to the semiconductor narrative the uh what's going on with LK 99 I have um I guess I listened to a couple podcasts on it and I was struck by the fact it sounds like a 25 Delta that it's something that will be real in like three to five years here's here here's something that I've been thinking about is there seems to be other things that are interesting that are on the periphery of technological breakthroughs that aren't crypto and that is probably harming allocation to crypto so for example having AI was the first big big sort of blow to crypto where everybody in crypto is like I said we're not the hot new technology anymore like it's possible what do you think if Chad CPT hadn't hadn't come out this year do you think that crypto would be higher no no doubt um ultimately again I think I have a slightly different thesis from you I'm I'm losing faith in the multi-chain world um I think that most non-etherium ecosystems will die I agree with you that if you believe in blockchain based applications you're effectively putting your bets on ease um I think that chat GPT by proving you know a use case for emergent technology basically invalidates a lot of what is going on in the altcoin space the sort of long-tailed crypto that people were investing in speculatively for years like chat GPT just reminded people that new tech can actually be useful whereas like your coin number 500 just has no use case or users whatsoever chat GPT is bad for that stuff I don't think chat GPT or super you know superconductors or any of you know cold fusion or whatever's next is going to matter for Bitcoin and each of those has its own narrative narrative for Bitcoin is you know it is a candidate for Global Reserve asset slash digital goal peer-to-peer money that will supplant maybe the bottom 50 of the world's 180 recognized Fiat currencies as well as it has you know it also has a role in challenging central banks not to debase their currencies too much that's Bitcoin off to one side to the other side you have eat a database that is owned by no one and everyone and there is use for that because you know if you have something like a deed to your house or a certificate of authenticity for that piece of art that you bought like why should it be stored by some random startup that'll probably go bankrupt you know it should be stored you know in kind of like incredibly neutral database so like you have those two things and I I think there's real use for both of them and if you're ignoring it maybe you're just focused on your little developed markets lens and you'll see what value it's providing to other people it has a stable coins-based layer use cases well we're going to talk about that in a second but like the rest of this you know there's there's definitely a a case to be made as you know we keep going back to Mike novogratz's comment on this podcast we are in the show me phase for crypto chat GPT has done a show me right and so now if you you look at anything that's non-bitcoin and non-ease you look at it with like a real skeptical kind of like like you know stroke your stroke your beard type uh quizzical look and say like what is what is being shown what use case is being shut and to your earlier point about Pepe and Obama coin uh I do think that Meme coins uh are are kind of a cooler more fun version of the lottery we've talked about this on the podcast as well so that there is a use case that you can't ignore Community is sort of a use case but like yeah I think chat GPT is bad for useless things or things that haven't proven to use yet what do you think yeah I don't I don't disagree with any of that in the um yeah I don't I actually I agree with everything that you just said in the in the long run I think in the short run my take would be that there's definitely been some VC Capital some Silicon Valley Capital that may have gone to crypto that that pivoted out I had went to and went to AI stocks so for example there's a lot of fast money in Nvidia I would assume some of that fast money if AI hadn't existed would have found a home in crypto there had been some some percentage of that that would have thought Bitcoin as their gambling fix or bought ethereum is their gambling fixer about Pepe you know whatever yeah um so I I do think that there is there's there's some of that but then the then then the flip side becomes true right which is that once you get Peak saturation of these memes then crypto can start to go I think crypto can actually attract some flows again that's a great point right it feels like the capital is in the stuck in Nvidia forever as soon you know Nvidia is priced to the moon now and Bitcoin hasn't yeah it still kind of blows relative to potentials so could just flow right back one day that's a little bit of what I'm thinking is that it it it it it will actually do that um over the next call it you know two to two to three months I'm definitely on the last podcast I was a lot more bearish we're trading like 30k at the time uh I was I was a lot more I was a lot more bearish now I'm a lot more constructive I think just from a technical standpoint we retested 28.5 um you know I think that that 27 area was the original was it was the original Target but we clearly stepped into demand you see today NASDAQ down one and a half percent Bitcoin up 1.83 just across the board all coins have started to do okay a lot of them just haven't come off as hard as I would have I would have expected given the way that um Bitcoin is performing it's been a while Dylan's crypto's outperformed the NASDAQ yeah I mean I can't I I can't even remember uh last time this happened so I I think on on all on all accounts and I just crypto is looking a lot healthier it's looking better it looks like we flushed a lot of the speculative Capital we found Pockets that we found pockets of demand so I'm you know I'm definitely feeling a lot better now than two than than I was before so I think that's why in the absence of the BlackRock ETF filing which triggered that massive rally in June um the space just sort of trickles a bit lower with an occasional micro pop and then trickles lower again um I think it's gonna take I think maybe you know you mentioned this earlier Abby Maybe some guidelines need to be laid down yeah I I think I think I think so too I the the PayPal thing was really interesting to me because it made it very clear that that's exactly what The Regulators are trying to do what happened exactly with PayPal for the listeners so PayPal got their they got their stable coin approved and there was a lot of noise around well you know the controls around the stable coin and they could wipe your balances and they control things but that doesn't matter they can do that with your current money anyway um so and we never really expected a centralized financial institution to lean in very heavily into these decentralized ethos but let's put that aside for a second what does this mean it means that there is a regulator out there that stopped meta and stopped Facebook from issuing their stablecoin that sued coinbase but is okay with PayPal issuing a stable and so what is very clear to me now more so than it was before is that the government of the United States doesn't dislike crypto they just want to make sure they can control for right control control the gateways to crypto it's not about shutting it down it's about making sure the right people are the gateways but they do have a lot of scale like PayPal has four to five hundred million users coinbase only has a hundred right so that means that there are tremendous amount of people that could come into crypto because of what PayPal is doing which is good and that's bullish now the question is obviously what does what does PayPal do now are they going to stop with their stable coin right now they list four assets they list Bitcoin ethereum Litecoin and Bitcoin cash for some reason and now they're gonna have a stable coin are they going to start taking on coinbase are they going to start listing other assets are they going to win the approval to go trade different things when coinbase is currently facing scrutiny from the SEC I mean you know that that's that's a question that you have to ask especially as an investor in this space which is what what is what is going to happen next with PayPal what are the downstream effects from this I think at the margin it makes me personally less likely to own coinbase makes it you know maybe more likely we you want to own some PayPal in your in your in your portfolio now uh all all of this all all of this to say it's very clear that the environment for crypto is Shifting right now you have the ETFs you have the stable coin the uh Ripple lawsuit I don't know what's coming next but it's clear that they're green shoots in a way that there weren't prior and that makes me more bullish and so if you were a listener on the last podcast and you heard me waxing bearish I'm changing my tune a bit and I think the other big thing about this PayPal stable coin like if you zoom out right let's say that PayPal just had carte blums to do whatever it wanted with crypto and there was no interference from any any government PayPal could issue a PayPal could just issue their stable coin make it interest barrier right um and then tell Merchants hey if you set up a PayPal wallet when someone swipes their PayPal card at your you know coffee shop or newsstand um we won't charge you credit card fees you just get interest bearing money yielding five and a quarter percent you know wired within you know block time 13 seconds from from the user's account your customer's account to yours right then suddenly you've disrupted Visa Mastercard JPMorgan Bank of America like no one needs a checking account or a credit card anymore it's just like ludicrous benefits there so obviously there are a few roadblocks between that happening and where we are today but it's sort of a first step along that journey and it shows you the promise of crypto for developed markets in developing markets PayPal pyusd it's just like a no-brainer um I think that's why you're seeing things like usdc uh losing market share you know they I think on the highs their their market cap is 55 or 60 billion and it's I haven't checked but um now it's it's only 30 billion tether is hovering around 80 but de-pegged you know by 10 basis points recently on you know doj headlines and you're going to have a world a sort of a binary world where crypto looking things are either blessed and flourishing or just like under constant attack and you know threat of being shut down you know um it's uh you're gonna see continued fud in in some of those assets that aren't necessarily in the good graces of the institutions that will ultimately be dictating what crypto looks like if that's how this ends up playing yeah my I I would agree I would agree with all that wholeheartedly um it's going to be really interesting record though I still think tether's a great product I think it offers a real solution to the developing world and I do not think it will get um interfered with nearly to the extent that crypto Twitter does I think it's here to stay you think so why why why you don't think that doj could take it down even if they wanted to I mean I wouldn't go that far I just don't think they will um I think they have frankly bigger fish to fry I I thought it was kind of interesting how uh how Heather started to as as tether as tether started to de-peg earned all these rumors around Kobe um you know and and this and the shadiness that's that's going on there just how quickly these things tend to reverse simply every every time there's some amount of nervousness in the market people just try to attack attack tether and it's been through so much at this point that I view it as very unlikely that it has a that it has a hole the risk that I see with tether is purely that the doj decides to come after them and say hey these guys are facilitating money transfers to sanctionations and we don't want that at all we don't want any of that and so we're going to shut them down everybody's gonna get their money back but they're gonna they're gonna stop stop operating now the thing is that wouldn't result in a deep Peg though that would be an orderly unwind oh I don't I don't think I don't think it has a hole but I think that there's some amount of time value for example imagine if it takes you two months to go get your money then tether will depeg a little bit uh as people try to get their money get their money shooter right it's like you know what's what what are you saying like if if so much of the float tried to redeem all at once that it may overwhelm the mint redeem mechanism that keeps if I were tether what I would do personally um is I think it would be a lot better for the industry to have uh if you're going to operate something like that you probably want to break yourself up and just like take the liquidity hit like it's probably uh you know you you probably want to have like three different stable coins that you then like three or three different companies and even if the the network even if a network effect isn't there um just uh like insulate yourself from from from risk a little bit but uh yeah I mean I I think that the the risk from tether is very low relative to the risks homophobia or an okay X or or a binance going down I think at this point you know one one really interesting conversation that I had with somebody that's very close to the scene in uh in China right now that said that the the first iteration and first wave of everybody that built abroad were kind of people that were very likely from Shady backgrounds to begin with and they just got in early to crypto because that was the type of person that caught in early they built very big companies and then they institutionalized them this time as time goes on but there's a new crop of people coming in that are coming at the x10 XL X Alibaba people that took the Silicon Valley wave that's coming in now especially with the with Hong Kong opening up a little bit so that you're going to see better less shady and more straightforward products uh offshore uh in in the East which I'm pretty I'm pretty excited to see this is why I'm going out which is which is why I'm going out there next month uh for for token 2049 which should be a pretty good a pretty good conference I'm trying to get a better read on on that area of the world but I think what I realized is that business culture is not uniform across the globe right so if you're going to trade a global fungible product whether it be a hydrocarbon like LNG or crude oil or you know a dollarized uh form of value like tether or um you know anything in between Bitcoin is is the most Salient example of this like um people will people in jurisdiction X will have vehement opinions about the asset that people in jurisdiction why adore and vice versa that's just how Global Commerce works is it's nothing unique to crypto and just you know to put a boa in that thought the way that I'd close it out is like I think it's a testament to the resilience and you know kind of staying power of Bitcoin and eats and and a lot of stable coins like tether as well that they are able to transcend those differences and offer you know product Market fit across these these vastly differing jurisdictions and opinions I think it's important you know that's part of why I joined crypto I it started to look familiar to me when it started doing that Jonah before we go just because I'm very interested and we've talked about crypto for 42 minutes now is oil Market interesting again yes what's going to happen in oil for all of you in crypto Finance is you're gonna have high interest rates uh impact production it just like the business of digging oil out of the earth becomes so much more expensive it's very Capital intensive for all Commodities but the the timing of that sort of relationship between higher interest rates and you know less oil coming out of the earth there's a delay there it's like a 6 to 18 month DeLay So I think what's going to happen demand is forecasted to rise over the course of the next two years but interest rates are going to curtail production as well as other factors geopolitical factors in particular and then I think you're going to get one of those things that happens in the Twilight of a Commodities sort of rain over over a particular Market sector in oil's case it's Transportation where the modernity rallies substantially into that consistent slash Rising demand against the backdrop of reducing production and then you reach a price where it eventually just you know squelches demand and then you then you get a pretty glorious sell-off uh for people who trade it followed by some some wild volatility and I think Bitcoin will maybe do that in 100 years but right now Bitcoins where Oil was in the late 1800s you know sort of proving product Market fit and starting to Rally so you know very interesting you know ends of this this barbell what do you I mean what do you think that's that that's all I mean I have no idea you're the oil Trader I just wanted to ask you to get your opinion on this oh well I think it's I think it's fastly surprised it's because a lot of countries start buying and sell of oil denominated one day you think so you think just because it's a neutral asset I think it's because and again you know we gotta rap soon but let's say that you are Chad you're producing oil you sell it then you get dollars for that sale the banking system that delivers you those dollars is like t plus 17 days because you're you're an oil company and Chad and then what do you do with those dollars in chat convert them to Local currency via somebody who's gonna you know take your pants off on that transaction and then spend it or how does it really work they're going to use a Bitcoin or it sounds like they might use tether or tether yeah so I think uh commodity trade will eventually start redenominating many Staples maybe Bitcoin maybe a bit about definitely definitely definitely the gray Market trade I was do that yeah yeah makes sense well anyway you heard you heard it here first oil for Bitcoin soon uh Jonah as as always it's a pleasure great seeing you Abby it's an awesome podcast thanks for taking the time always says take care [Music]

Transcript Text:
Bitcoin doesn't care about xrp xrp cares about xrp if you look at the xrp chart it was trading 47 cents then it ripped up to 95 cents and has sort of resolved around 76 cents that's a that's a 60 Rally or 50 rally something in there that's monster that's monster price action now the volatility of that asset is probably determined by uh you know somewhat determined by the fact that it's far less liquid than Bitcoin um but it tells you that the ruling was spectacularly positive for crypto thank you all right welcome back to another episode of a thousand X this time you are stuck with me and Jonah as we talked to you about the markets we'll have a very special guest at some point in the future and very excited about it but for now we are going to talk about all of the things that have happened over the last two weeks since we last joined you of which there's been a lot a lot of things Bitcoin Bitcoin almost hit 32 it's back down to 30 as we're recording this podcast a judge ruled in the Europa lawsuit and ripple seems to have come out of that in a much stronger position than they were before and it's opened the doors for other altcoins to potentially be deemed not Securities if they're issued and traded in a very specific way and the market in general has reacted very favorably to that outside of Bitcoin so eth BTC is higher most alt ratios against Bitcoin are higher but Bitcoin is actually below where the news came out and so that is you know a it's telling it tells you a lot about the type of Market participant it tells you a lot about the fears in the market you have the NASDAQ ripping uh pretty pretty hard s PS doing doing quite well fears around inflation are coming down the cry after the Ripple case was that we're past everything bad and that Bitcoin could only go up and now we're back down so Jonah what do you make of that it's a great intro um I think there's a bit of an issue with Bitcoin right now which is that there are still some issues surrounding binance and some fear about what might happen with uh the general liquidity climate in crypto so let's say you're at a traditional Finance institution like Pimco or BlackRock or or even a hedge fund like Millennium and you want to buy Bitcoin spot institutionally it's probably difficult for you to do so so what are your options if you want to get long Bitcoin well you can invest in one of these crypto funds you know they're they're asset managers that get you long Bitcoin and those asset managers have seen four consecutive weeks of the largest inflows uh of the last 12 you know last 12 months right so those funds are getting inflows you can buy CME futures which traded a significant premium to spot where you can buy one of these you know if you don't if you can't touch spot you you have to buy one of these discounted ETP products like the you know the grayscale Bitcoin trust or bitwise or something um and if you want to buy a spot you know uh you're you're looking at custody issues and all the crypto native stuff that people listening to this podcast are probably familiar with but you know maybe a lot of hedge funds and asset managers and Pension funds aren't necessarily comfortable with just yet so I think the best way to track this is to look at CME Futures basis so where do the Futures trade relative to spot and right now um the Futures are trading 12 annualized above spot so that tells you that there is tradfied demand for Bitcoin length um and not enough and and that that tradify length exceeds you know the the spot bottleneck that I just discussed call it a regulatory bottleneck call it a an operational bottleneck you know if if uh that you should not be able to earn 12 a year buying spot and shorting Bitcoin Futures against it that is a riskless trade but clearly there aren't enough arbitragers out there able to do that so it shows you that there's demand for Bitcoin but a bit of a liquidity and Market structure problem that will ultimately get solved but but hasn't been solved just yet so I think I think Bitcoin would be higher if it weren't for the fact that you have Market structure issues getting worked out right now that makes a ton of sense Jonah some practical advice here if you want to go look at the CME Futures curve where can you go do that um if you have a Bloomberg terminal it's very easy I haven't actually tried doing it on on trading view but ultimately if you go to the CME website um anyone can do this you can go to CME website pull up the contract spec for Bitcoin Futures and then the CME will publish what's called an end of day report it's a little clunky but you can just go in and look at all the different Futures prices at the end of the day relative to bitcoin's spot at the same time that should be helpful and I think your point your point there is very clear which is that people can't come in there there are a lot of people that can't come in and actually buy Spot and perform the trade and you have to assume that the the trade leg that's difficult to access is the spotlight right because if you add I'm sure there are a lot of Market neutral funds out there that would love to come in and capture that 12 especially because it's levered right because you you only have to post something like 35 on the C on the CME Futures in order in order to go and trade them so it's you know it's quite it's quite Capital efficient from from that from that perspective uh I guess what the the the the one thing that really stands out here is that for the last year we haven't really had any contango and see in CME Futures so I do think some of that is a lack of accessibility to spot and I assume that the spot Market has gone harder to access for a lot of people but a portion of that is definitely I would assume people betting on the ETF at least some some amount of that and just general demand for crypto like in a bear when when the Market's selling off nobody's getting long futures they're using them as a liquid instrument to short Bitcoin as it's going down one of the things that always worries me is when you have really good news and you can't get higher and it doesn't bring in the capital that you were expecting it to bring in that's generally a pretty bearish side so I think it goes both ways if bad news can't bring the market lower that's bullish if good news can't take the market higher that's bearish that's a great point and just to interject one quick thing there before you continue normally when good news comes out and markets don't rally I agree with you it's bearish but you you sometimes just don't know why and you have to you have to respect the price action and be cautious like here we actually have a working hypothesis as to why so maybe the market structure just needs to untangle itself before this asset class can rally and you'll have you know lower prices to buy in the near future yeah I'd agree with that I think people are just too worried about what the the doj may or may not do to binance what the SEC may or may not do to binance I think that there's just a lot of hesitation in the market right now and you really really really have to believe that if you're buying 30k you got to get to at least 40. right for an acid as volatile as volatile as Bitcoin you want good returns and the issue is that if you're buying let's say you're buying 2K eth or you're buying 30k BTC you want 40K or you want 3K for me and if those two prices are not reasonable in your mind then you're not going to deploy at those levels and so what ends up happening is that the only people that buy those breakouts the people that are buying 31 the people that are buying above 2K are the fomo buyers which are very weak handed so what you really need is I think you need to clear the air you we're really only going to go higher once we get a resolution for the market players that we just that we just talked about once that comes to an end whether it's positive or negative than the market then the market can go higher and one thing that's I think useful for viewers and listeners to appreciate is and I've seen this happen over and over is it because there isn't new money coming into the market in a substantial way one of the best ways to track the validity of a move is to go and coinilize and just look to see how much open interest was opened during that move so for example there was a move to 31k three weeks ago that was one to one correlated with open interest increase to the downside every time we get lower uh what you see is you see a lot of shorts pilot right so I mean as I'm speaking right now there have been a lot of shorts that have piled into piled into Bitcoin sub 30k once you go above 30 they probably close and so really this has just turned into an extremely PVP Market that your name is PVP this just player versus player it's not there's a you know in Runescape uh video game that I I used to play that listener should know about because I've talked about it at length on previous podcasts I you know you used to go one of the one of the things you would do when you were bored is you'd go into this place called The Wilderness and you'd find other people around your level and you just fight them now most of the time it's a player it's a player versus computer or a player versus monster game you're you're battling the video game itself you're not battling other other players and you know when I was bored I'd go battle I'd go battle other players and that's kind of what's Happening Here is you're not you're not buying from retail that's selling to you you're not selling to retail that's buying from you you're not buying even from institutions that are right there's no there's none of that you're buying from other people that are looking to play you for the greater fool and you're looking to play them for the greater full and there's no genuine you know coagulation of uh acceptance at this moment in time and so you get left with is a lot of very choppy price movement in the market you got left with the three percent move up and then a three percent move down over and over until people quit and generally what I've seen is that this type of price action is not bullish it's generally bearish and so my bets are that this range this 30 to 32k range X a re a positive resolution from binance or tether likely resolves lower because there's a lack of interest in the space right now so you really either need well let me let me add another caveat and ETF approval a genuine approval could do that but at this point the probability of an ETF getting approved isn't likely going up or down likely staying the same over the next you know few few months and so it's really a resolution resolution on the other fronts I mean just a quick comment on that uh when I was when I was a kid I played Street Fighter I went into the woods and played Street Fighter with people of equal talent to me so it's you know just to give you a sense of the date range between avi's video game life and mine um I think Street Fighter is pretty awesome though anyway uh I I think I have a slightly different take on it from you just looking at the chart looking at the daily chart the daily candles what really ripped the market was the BlackRock ETF news back in June right Bitcoin doesn't care about xrp xrp cares about xrp if you look at the xrp chart it was trading 47 cents then it ripped up to 95 cents and has sort of resolved around 76 cents that's a that's a 60 Rally or 50 rally something in there that's monster that's monster price action now the volatility of that asset is probably determined by uh you know somewhat determined by the fact that it's far less liquid than Bitcoin um but it tells you that the ruling was spectacularly positive for crypto um but I think ultimately the thesis for altcoins I think what the price action is telling you is that the thesis for altcoins it's just an entirely different Marketplace from Bitcoin right now like Bitcoin is a macro asset it's digital gold it's D dollarization it's peer-to-peer money it's uh you know potentially a threat to Dollar dominance in global trade over a 50-year Time Horizon like you have all these overarching narratives with for Bitcoin They Don't Really overlap with the the narratives for altcoins which are more like hey can you know can projects issue math based um math based sort of let's just call them instruments for now we don't even know what they are anymore Securities or not so uh ultimately eth BTC you brought it up earlier that should be the barometer for this dichotomy and it didn't rally that much it rallied from 0.61 to point oh sorry 0.061 to 0.063 on the ruling and like if you look at some of the you know the alt L ones they they popped a bit versus eth but then they're kind of drifting back off again I I don't I think what all of this tells you zooming way back out um is the market just cares about an ETF Market doesn't care about whether these things are securities or not right now you know and if there's an ETF then you have probably a universe that contains trillions or tens of trillions of dollars that can just easily click trade Bitcoin whereas right now your universe is probably under a trillion yeah I I think I think all of that is fair I think the one asset that actually cared about what was going on is Ripple or xrp and you can see that in its in its pricing and one thing that I was thinking about that the ruling didn't cover is what are the criteria for determining whether something is genuinely security what are the actions and behaviors of the people that have issued the token that make it a security versus an auto security because you basically need to make the case for all these other assets that they've acted in a similar fashion to the Ripple management team with their with regard to their interaction with the token and so they weren't promotional they were you know they're all these different criteria that go into it it's not the ruling Says Yes xrp sold on an exchange is not a security but a very clear that the criteria it cannot and is not just if it's sold on an exchange and is a token then it's not a security obviously if Apple were to come out and they were to say hey guys we're going to take our equity and you give it back to us we're going to give you a token and that token is going to trade on uniswap and everything else is going to be the same that doesn't make that token or not not a security and right you see you see what I'm saying so there are other there are other criteria that go into it that may or may not foot with these other altcoins which I think the market started to realize and sober up now that being said the outcome I do think is helpful in that it sets some vague guidelines up about what you can do to potentially not be a security if you act in these certain ways that the Ripple team has acted in maybe you also can be deemed a not security if you take if you take that path what that means for the rest of the alt Market is that funds can be can use their judgment to allocate in a way that they couldn't really before because there was no criteria for using that judge and so in general I think that this is bullish for the market and I do think that we've seen a top in Bitcoin for parts of the alt market like I think that if you like it will cause a dispersion trade meaning that tokens like ethereum you know vitalik never like did a deal with IBM to try and generate PR and issued them like a block of eth right it was all just a you know an Ico where you paid Bitcoin sent Bitcoin to an address and got some eth back out of it um pretty amazing trade for anyone who did that by the way but uh you know then you have tokens like um well don't want to name names but you know tokens that have literally just taken massive chunks of value out of their foundation and just sent it to wallet addresses of web 2 companies to try and generate PR and uh you know maybe that's not kosher according to you know what what this new ruling has laid out in terms of what what could potentially be lawful and what what's not so ultimately um I think some alts should rip like I eat uh very bullish very very bullish eth is ruling um I think eth has probably underperformed uh the ruling but other alts I would be careful I don't think this is a trade for the entire like the top 100. yeah that that I that I would agree with I I do really there are some altcoins that I really like uh I'll just name name out some here in terms of and again not Financial advice never is financial advice these are just all coins that seem to be doing a good job generating traction for themselves uh so optimism is one of them they it's done it's done a phenomenal job better than most other assets out there coordinating with other participants that want to build l2s and managing to extract value back to them so for example a project that didn't do this well was Cosmos Luna was built on top of Cosmos it got to 100 billion market cap Adam only got to 20 billion it did a terrible job despite providing the base layer for a lot of different applications and a lot of different protocols extracting value from that now optimism has done something different and they've actually gotten you know in in in writing that they're going to get 10 of the fee of the sequencer fees generated by base coinbase uh is L2 and so World coin is also building on optimism and there may be there there may be some economic agreement there and there now can be economic agreements built into using the optimism based stack so that optimism holders benefit if their attack that was built by the optimism Foundation actually gets used in other places and they've done a very very good job with this and so I really like I really like what they've done uh I do think that arbitrum benefits from this uh this this knock on this knock-on effect as well despite the fact that they're that they're competitors uh which we can which we can get into in a bit and I and one thing I've noticed is that uh link has been performing quite well today and yesterday and I think a portion of that is because they finally release ccip which is inter communication protocol between uh between uh like they're they're layer to layer communication protocol and that was expected in Q4 and it's come out a little bit early and so that's been that that's been good to see I think in general um in general what I found is that uh you know there are select altcoins that are doing well from a fundamental and perspective and that they're actually building the right things and they've they've tackled the right areas and these guys have tended to do a lot better than the than the aggregate all coin market and I think that will that will continue you you just mentioned doing the right things let's talk about what the right things are because we haven't talked about all coins for a while they've just been this basket of accused tokens in in the you know in the world we live in now they're you know maybe we're in the first Innings of a new bull cycle for all coins maybe uh have to figure this out and think through it every Trader does so you know we we seem to agree that some altcoins are amazing or you know have have potential at the very least and others just stay away it's not it's not an all-alt coin market like it was in 2021. um let's let's try to examine for the listeners like let's get let's let's get your opinion obvious as a crypto native on the concept of are we moving to a multi-chain world still or is it really just gonna be all about ethereum for you know on-chained Computing over the course of the next cycle I I tend to think the latter I tend to think that you know your solanas nears and polka dots and all these other coins are just kind of these ecosystems are dead Dead on Arrival at this point you look at defy llama there's no tvl you look at the user counts and wallet addresses they're all just sort of like plateauing meanwhile the ecosystem and the two all coins you just mentioned are you know which are part of it um not link obviously but arbitrum and optimism like that that's the only ecosystem that seems to be flourishing in this in this bear market so are is is the multi-chain thesis still alive for the next cycle I I vote no I think it's it's time to write it off what do you think I think what ends up happening is you get projects that are willing to build on things like Solana and Avalanche and near and all of these other protocols because if they're competent good team uh they can win that space uh they're probably when the when able Market comes back there's probably still going to be incentive programs that these that these protocols run out and yeah but incentive programs that's that's been the only draw so far like that doesn't last forever right right but what I'm what I'm saying what I'm saying is that okay so here's here's my perspective Jonah maybe to clarify I don't think these guys were dead I think that they're gonna experience a Renaissance at some point because of that novelty factor I don't necessarily think that they're going to be a long-term successful but because they have the ability to onboard people through the mechanism that I just described they do have the potential to reach escape velocity and become real projects what computational ability is possible on soul that isn't possible on Solana rather that isn't possible on arbitrum or optimism at this point like does the tech matter yeah it does I think right now there's a decent amount I think the issue is that there it's a it's a use case fit I'll give you an example and it's almost it's almost always a use case uh fit not necessarily a tech a tech fit so there was a large operation maybe a year ago 18 months ago at this point to get real world assets onboarded into crypto and there are all these different protocols that we're trying to do it there were the you know protocols uh that were at at the at the base level some protocols launched that they wanted to introduce kyc at the base level they were in L1 they're like we're a fully kyc level one um and that's our Edge because if your application and you have kyc it doesn't it doesn't matter you have to have kyc at the at the base level and some of the applications like oh well we've got kyc at our level and that's all you need you don't need any you don't need anything more than that and some would say well you need composability uh and so we're going to build that first and others would say you don't need composability um so we're not going to worry about that we're going to worry about the ability to let people like aggregate people invest um at scale and so they're all these different approaches to Bringing real world assets on board and there are all these things that had good tech there were these things that had bad Tech but the reality was at the end of the day that the issue is that the people that were issuing these real world assets didn't know what to issue and didn't know how to do it and didn't know what would be useful or what wouldn't be useful and so the one thing that we've seen over and over and over again is that uh the constraint is not always the the constraint is figuring out what to do with the tech right and starting and starting small so what I'm I guess what I'm trying to say is that there aren't that many things today that aren't building on crypto because it's far too slow or the tech isn't there uh you first you have to start with well what are what are we actually what are we actually building and by the way on real world assets I think that we're getting to a point uh figure is a really interesting project that's been doing well that's been generating revenues uh they're a large issuer of uh of of uh mortgage-backed Securities now um they are actually issuing things directly on chain and that's that's very very important as opposed to there's there's another you know area where people are taking assets or putting them in sbv they're tokenizing the sbv and then they're trading the token but that there's a big difference between doing that and then issuing directly issuing directly on chain and so now there is you know they're real assets that are being that are being issued on chain which I think is which I which I think is great but to bring it back uh I don't necessarily think the tech is is is the is the bottleneck it's figuring out what to build with the tech yeah um I think your point is correct but I think your point kind of proves my point which is that if it isn't about the tech what's the advantage of one shiny alt L1 versus another versus eth like there's no like eth kind of gives you everything you need right now for today's limited slate of use cases if there was if eth was just like bowling over because of you know too many people trying to use it or too much throughput and it couldn't process certain types of like ultra high definition AAA video games that Solana could or near could then then you have an ALT L1 thesis right there but you we aren't we aren't even like at the point where eth has problems let alone these others so I think in terms but I do think your point is super valid and again you know on every episode I I blather about Commodities because that's just how I was educated I think and to your point about um you know real world assets let's say let's say that you created something like a tokenized carbon credit that would be a fantastic use case for a real world asset uh on chain um because is it it's carbon so it's real but it's not like uh it's not like a house where you need the legal system to link the token to the actual real world asset you could have a centralized entity that everybody trusts like shell or Exxon Mobil issue shell carbon coin right and then if you buy a shell carbon coin and you burn it then you have trust that shell will plant a tree or uh capture another ton of carbon on top of one of their you know refineries in Europe or something somewhere right remove carbon from the atmosphere so I think like real world assets are going to have to start as they as they filter on chain we'll have to start off as fungible um like kind of fungible Commodities Global Commodities I think that's easier than like one-off things like real estate where like if I own a digital tokenized mortgage um like how do I and then I default on it like how does the government get it back from me I don't know so or how does the how does it get auctioned off in my default you need the legal system to Tribute that's too complicated meanwhile if a single centralized entity does what they promise to do issue them issuing a token to represent that in a math-based way is probably easier than them having to like go register a new commodity with the ice the CME and get it listed and trade it all over the world you know it's it's it's slightly easier and more logical and I don't think you need I don't think you need like Cosmos or some wild app chain to do that you could just you could just write that smart contract in solidity and plop it on on uh you know an L an East the East Main net or an L1 or an L2 sorry yeah I I would I would agree with that although you know uh a large portion of this is just because of the capture of a lot of the the ways that these things are traded I mean you should know this about carbon credits you're you're you're in that world they're they're they're only there's like one place you can trade them there's one place that custodyism or sorry there's one place that custodies them uh that has like 70 70 of the market uh and so it's just a little bit a little bit tougher to to break it in but I want to um I do wanna I do want to spend a little bit of time just because it's it's just really really fascinating right now there's been so much talk about how we've we've reached a point where we're looking at Clear Skies in the macro World things are starting to look quite Rosy and so there's people are saying okay well the FED is the Fed is going to be done now hikes hikes aren't coming through markets are performing markets are performing very well people are going to get reallocated there's a good now that there's good probability good probability of a soft blending recessionary talk has gone away a bit and if you look one of the one of the things that was kind of interesting to me is out outside of the top seven performers in the s p the EPS is only 15x or 14x15x so and 70 I think 75 percent of the performance this year has come from the top the top seven performers that have done very well on soldiers Tech and so what what you see is okay well the rest of the world is still reasonably cheap and we're being driven by the we're being driven by these uh by these by these top performers so if if you had to battle that do you think you could construct a bear case I could construct a bear case for risk assets um I think the bear case for risk assets including like non-nvidia non-facebook equities like things that aren't just benefiting from this unique AI boom um I could see I you know out here in Los Angeles you've got writers strikes um I could see you know new disruptive technology starting to accelerate plus higher cost of capital starting to accelerate layoffs also again back to Commodities my um my my sort of spiritual home uh High rates the impact of high rates takes a long time to filter through to the macro economy you know Bridgewater says six to 24 months or something it's it's not immediate so okay the rate hikes all just happened that doesn't mean that we're poised for uh for liftoff here what that means is like if you're producing Commodities suddenly it's way more expensive to find Capital to go and dig for those Commodities and pull them out of the earth so you're going to dig less right if you're uh building houses it's much more difficult to get a construction loan if you're if you're just any sort of business it's just tougher in this environment and so like if anything at all the rate hikes just happened now wait for all the cracks to start emerging uh and then you know I wouldn't be shocked if in 12 months because there's been less digging there are fewer natural resources so commodity prices are higher that's painful for everybody there's uh you know everything is sort of like you get like a stagflationary environment where businesses can't function and Profit the way that they used to people can't afford stuff uh mortgages start eating into everybody's bank accounts savings accounts rather and you know the prolonged impact of where we are uh hurts risk assets so I I think I think the delay effect is would be my bear case but frankly I don't know like I I think the FED has it's looking like they might have pulled a rabbit out of a hat here and I don't have enough experience with like rate hike environments what was the last big one it was they tried in 2018 that you turned maybe sometime in like early 2000s this happened I like I just wasn't a Trader but when the last time this environment was was uh you know taking place yeah I mean the reason the reason I asked is because I also think they pulled a rabbit out of a hat and I always try to figure out I mean one of my favorite favorite exercises is just okay you have you have an opinion let's figure out where that opinion is incorrect um and like you you make you make both arguments and then you go with the one that you find the most the most compelling and I'll be honest I didn't really find that super compelling I think it's yeah I mean I I I think if you want to get bearish just look at what happens when rates are high for a while like the effects aren't immediate yeah I I think you know I I I I think that that's a it's it's a reasonable argument but I I also think that you know things are things are relative still relatively cheap uh Acro across the board right now and so when I think about crypto in that in that context especially as inflation inflation is coming is coming down um I do think that people are are primed to come back at some point soon and so that makes me and the reason this is this is important right is because the last thing that you want is for the news that come out that we were talking about earlier in the podcast for Bitcoin to trade 28k and then for the macro environment to suddenly shift in your face and you've bought 28k because you think that that news was a great was a great buy and then everything's just started turning on you and you're just squarely you know in trouble that's one of the things I think is is really important to just place this in context is if you want to be if you want to be a dip buyer in this environment what is you know what are you what are you looking for to make sure that that dip buy is not you know uh a bad bad it depends on your time Horizon like here if you're a short-term dip buyer looking to sell out pops um I think I think you'd be crazy to buy it here I think ultimately what drives asset classes over the long run what drives Trends is real end user demand for the asset right like if you're looking to get Long human productivity and capitalism you buy the S P 500 if you think that the world fundamentally needs more hydrocarbon based Transportation you buy oil futures what why would you buy crypto for a long like why would you dip by crypto with a two-year Horizon um you know this may still be the dip to do that and But ultimately at some point talking about show me people need to just need you need people to need Bitcoin you need people to need eth you need eth to be settling millions of transactions either in the digital or the real world or both and that that that has to be important to the economy or or for Bitcoin you need Global some portion of global trade to be denominated in Bitcoin so that there's always demand from like sovereigns and corporations and you know Merchants for Bitcoin not quite there yet but the possibility of of getting there is real and so you know if you're if you're looking on a five-year time Horizon that's why you're you're dip buying crypto here if your time Horizon is shorter oh man covered a lot of topics in today's conversation Jonah indeed we did it was great to see you Avi it was it was good we we caught up in London for a bit had a had some really had some really really good food really really interesting conversations that I'm glad we didn't record and I'll I'll chat with you I'll chat with you soon chat with you soon Avi as always uh none of this is investment advice crypto is risky do your own research and uh thanks again for tuning in Thousand X take care everyone [Music] foreign

it's really as simple as when everybody's panicking you buy when everybody's euphoric you sell and I can guarantee you with 100 certainty that on ETF approval everybody is going to be absolutely for it [Music] lower buddy Joe nanabi here welcome back to another episode of a thousand X thank you very much for for tuning in with us today I'm broadcasting to you live from London England hello Avi how are you mate I'm doing all right Jonas is the price of Bitcoin the same in London as it is here importantly it is but not it counts pounds is a little bit lower below 30k still low from the past do you remember do you remember uh what when was it was it last year at this point it feels like it was it was recently but it's I know it's not when the pound almost hit parity with the dollar yeah like there was that there was a massive sell-off because of the guilts that was earlier this year no that was that was 2022 um the government did something stupid with pension it's not regulation I forget about the pound tagged and uh you know I had this I had this uh rah-rah America I'm American Living London mentality like uh pound's just gonna keep dropping and then it just ripped right back yeah I I remember I remember when it hit parody it's funny how these things tend to work it's like it's true in every single Market it's Peak Hysteria Peak Panic Peak oh my God new paradigm this time is different it's all over that's always always the bot it's insane I remember I do remember at a dollar I was browsing uh real estate Dubai and London even everybody else that's why I bounced it back yeah I mean London's an amazing like fiscal quasi-haven for a lot of people around around the globe not not to not to talk about London real estate um oh yeah that was September 30th 2022 my my times are way off but I remember um back then as we were browsing real estate everything ripped back and now it never ended up pulling it but I was hearing and maybe when I come join you in London next week we'll go do some sniffing around that a lot of people in the UK have 10-year mortgages as opposed to 30-year mortgages like the rate is fed is 10-year fixed not 30 year fixed uh and so as rates go up it's going to put a lot more pressure on the UK housing market than it does on the on the U.S housing market and that they're already talking to some dealers a lot of Supply coming on so maybe we should go house shopping together yeah we could uh we could be roommates from Atlanta life would be super happy about that moving in with Avi last week we spent a lot of time you know feeling pretty good right the price of Bitcoin hit 30 000 token in the middle of our podcast for the first time months um you know we're both long it was uh you know it felt good this time why don't we take a moment to explore and learn from some of the worst traits we've ever done so just to kick this off Avi what's you know where I can start if you want what's what's one of the stupidest worst or most costly traits you've ever done in your career and what how has it helped you become a better Trader since then every bad trade that you take is a tremendous learning opportunity uh you know sometimes you that I mean in my opinion actually you learn the most from the trades that that you messed up I learned almost nothing from the trades that I won big on uh you know sometimes a little bit but realistically I just feel good and this was probably the biggest learning opportunity for me was back in 2019 uh when Bitcoin ripped from 3K from 3K to 14K I had done a very very good job riding that wave uh I was one of the the the larger participants on on derabit at the time uh there were there wasn't a lot of options volume going through fall was tremendously mispriced uh after Bitcoin ripped from 3K to 4K and I just started buying upside buying upside buying upside and I just ran up my account super hard and then at 1314k uh it was a little bit of recency bias it was hey I've made so much money buying these options and I've made so much money I you know exploiting this inefficiency that even though the inefficiency had completely gone at that point I mean Vol was trading plus a hundred in my mind I was like well I'm really good at this and this has been a really good instrument and I think I can make a lot of money if I keep if I keep going and so I just really took a took an absolute beating at the top at the top in 14k uh because I was so I was so exposed to upside upside calls and and actually I actually remember this one moment where I Pro I could have gotten out uh and I I just thought about it in the wrong way so I remember on the sell-off from 14 to 12 or it was a pretty rapid sell-off and Vol this was in on 2000 2019 to 2019 and fall on options in the sell-off went up so much that despite going down 10 15 in price the value of my options only went down like five six percent which is insane like that was it was like a mat yeah my calls like my calls uh despite being you know going going the wrong way with price they stay the same price and I looked at that and I thought okay that's a great opportunity to stay long because I haven't lost any money so there's no reason there's no reason to sell uh and uh one thing that I I've learned from that and that's actually been a pretty phenomenal trade um over the last over the last few years is any time you get a massive short-term Spike involved in the crypto markets that is a 99 hit rate sell like you and you said you can build in those markets yeah you can build well you can build like a you can build a model on it right just look at the one day what's a choose three standard deviation move involve if that happens you're probably selling you should probably sell yeah I it makes it even better when it's close to end of month but that's uh that that it did teach me that trade that's a good example Abby thank you for sharing um for me I think it's a bit of a well put it this way earlier in my career um I would you know was fresh out the gates scared to lose money um and somebody finally gave me the advice like hey Jonah if you trade to not lose money you'll just lose money so trade to make money it involves taking some risk and put yourself out there so I was still a little nervous and I I spent a lot of time trying to really think things through before I dip my toes in because you know I I was once you dip your toes in you got you got to be prepared to get wet so I ended up getting a couple of things pretty right um namely Facebook stock and Bitcoin um and to some extent crude oil but I think I was I was a little bit you know I I would make 10 20 30 50 on a little bit of money in my PA and I would just take profit I was like wow this is great then those things went up another 100x or 10x in the case of Facebook and I missed all of it so I thought dang I need to learn to ride a truck um and then that led to 2018 um the worst trade of my career which was conviction long crude oil dead right the market was tightening Supply was dropping off a cliff um everything was just going right pretty I was you know Max long at being company with a lot of capital A lot of risk tolerance you know having the best year of my career very quickly then things just got better and better then uh Trump uh came in and basically got a little nervous about the price of oil because High gasoline prices nuke presidencies um in election years and he he went a little soft on Iran he he waived the sanctions for a bit and I didn't adapt to that information I stayed you know drum banging long long crude oil because of all I'd learned about missing out on big trends and I thought this was going to be a big Trend and I lost so much money took me a year and a half to to get back to my high water mark and what I've learned from that and simple as the Bitcoin and crypto Traders all over the world should hopefully take a little bit of notice it's like you can kick yourself when you miss a big Trend you can kick yourself when you think there's going to be a big Trend and it snaps back in your face so the critical piece of analysis to do this is what I've learned ever since ever since that 2018 implosion my p l is ask yourself whether you're on the break of some new technological or markets based unlock or whether you're at the peak of a hype cycle that's going to revert because um participants now perceive the asset that you've ridden to this point to be you know unattractive from a price perspective so Bitcoin miners are saying man 30k this looks like a level where we should really try to finance our business for years after what we've just been through let's let's sell everything right crypto could go straight back down equally if we're at 30k because a BlackRock ETF is about to get approved and 20 times more capital is about to enter this Market um don't sell whatever you do uh so I think that's what we got a debate on this podcast I I think that you can learn a lot from studying previous Bubbles and you can a lot you can learn a lot from studying previous trends and one of the most important things that you can do and probably the thing that's made me the single most money in my entire career is being a student of History every single time I talked to an older Trader or every single time you know I have I have conversations with people in this business who have been who have been very successful they're really two things that stand out to me one is that they've built themselves but tremendous intuition through many hours of just studying chart information balance sheets data they've just built themselves tremendous intuition to the point where uh you know a lot of people will look at we'll look at you know a drucken Miller or a Soros and they'll say oh man how do they make that decision how do they make that decision so quickly how do they make the right decision why do they make that decision and the reality is a lot of it is just prior study it's like it's like when you're to bring it back to a previous podcast with no words like when you're wrestling you just build muscle memory for yourself like you just do certain things in certain situations and you just know to do those things and that just comes from practice and studying uh and then the second thing is that the the things that they study the most uh are all is often history it's often it's often understanding you know what what has happened in the past and how do I and how do I apply that how do I apply that to the Future uh I think just I'll drop some of my favorite my favorite books and then we'll put we'll put them in the link in the link below but I would probably read three I would read the great game by John still Gordon which is a history of Wall Street which takes you through every single uh you know every single scam that anybody on Wall Street has ever pulled you know they're they they have they have anecdotes about how in the railroad boom people would rename their companies to be the Long Island Railroad Company and it would go up um they have stories they have stories about Jay Gould and his cornering of of markets they have stories about uh you know one there's there's one there's one famous story where a guy who's known to have a hot hand on the street in the 1920s goes to a club uh writes down a list of stocks to buy uh he's at a club where a bunch of Wall Street people go he's there with his broker he writes down a bunch of stocks to buy hands it to his broker and tells the broker to accidentally drop it on the way out of the club the broker accidentally drops it on the way out of the club and a bunch of people pick it up and they go oh this guy's at a really odd hand let me go buy these stocks and then he proceeds to sell it to them right so they're all these like different anecdotes and funny and funny things that happen so the great game by by John still Gordon uh the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros which I think is the best book in the world at teaching somebody how to play a bubble if you're in crypto you need to read this book it's like a seminal text of crypto despite being written many years before crypto was invented it deals with the concept of reflexivity and then the autobiography of Bernard Baruch which is a phenomenal uh phenomenal book that follows Bernard Baruch who was a one of the greatest traders of all time and was one of the people that successfully made it pivot into politics from Trading and ended up being an advisor to FDR just lived a fascinating life so I think that those books have really built a strong foundation for me in terms of developing my own personal trading style uh which just for the record is generally waiting for big opportunities and then when I find those big opportunities pressing them hard and riding that Trend patience is is hard I think patience and discipline are too the most important characteristics of any good Trader um and they're related but kind of had a book to your list Dobby just one sure um I would add the prize by Daniel jerkin it is the since you mentioned history and these are history books this is the Thousand page 150 year history of crude oil and the reason why it's so important for crypto and you know Traders at most markets is that a commodity is tradable technology right and crypto is also tradable technology which is why I think that crypto is a commodity um yeah there are many similarities between eats at crude oil uh oil is deflationary you can occasionally mine more but every time you put a little bit of it in your airplane to go fly somewhere or bus to go travel somewhere the global Supply decreases it gas is burned sure there are scaling Solutions that's the equivalent of you know Finding lore but ultimately the it's a deflationary asset that you use to unlock value in some product or service just like oil and oil in its early days uh which you learn in this in this crude oil book the prize is that it's got a Pulitzer Prize by the way very good um noise is that back then there was a you know the barbell debate that we have in crypto today is it useful or is it a scam is it garbage um same thing happened with crude oil back in the day when a bunch of Yale scientists were messing around with it it was like wow is this the future are we going to be able to like replace whale oil for kerosene you know create kerosene and make light out of it or is it just a bunch of tar that bubbles out of the grout because there's literally that much of it useless you know waste product right and so you look at the uh you know sort of inflation-adjusted price chart of crude oil in this book and they're still while swing somebody like out of inflation adjusted basis one of the highest I think if not the highest the second or third highest price point ever reached was in the late 1800s and then it went went down like 99 from there um and then you know so that's that's because that's because they didn't hard cap it Jonah they should have hardened him they should have no they should be like oh whoops that's actually really fascinating that it was deemed there were people that wrote it off as oh maybe it's just black tar bubbling out might not actually be useful that it's not technology I never yeah you know you never really you never really think about things like that but that's that's fascinating that that's great I like in the builders in the in the crypto space to the the Yale scientists who are just sort of like slaving away in the chemistry lab trying to refine it basically and it's not that hard you boil it take the steam cool the steam back off and you have kerosene Which flies Jets and creates light let's just distillation in crypto you know it's like does the world need a publicly owned spreadsheet yeah probably it does why to me this seems obvious but to every all the all the naysayers out there it's it's kind of a well why you know you could have a Amazon web services do the same thing you know I don't know we should get a naysayer on the podcast sometimes I think at this point the NASA the people that hate this stuff just don't understand it so it'd be like debating a flat earther it's like like why why even why even debate the thing is all of the points all of the I guess this is like circular reasoning because I was gonna say all of the ballot points that they bring up I agree with but like okay then obviously I'm doing the ballot um but but I do I do think that a lot of the uh a lot of the point okay I'll give you an example um a lot of the points brought up around you know our our utility tokens useful it's like well the majority of them aren't okay but that's well understood by every professional participant in the asset class it's like the majority what gives Bitcoin value nothing it's the belief that it has value that gives it value and the fact that it's a better money and on a variety of different metrics that gives it value but it's just you know there's there's yeah you're right they're selling backing it okay fine right what is is crypto or is defy better or worse than the traditional Financial system the people that say that the underlying Tech of the traditional Financial system is better than the underlying Tech of defy or delusional there's no argument it's just not true right and and the arguments that they might they might bring up or okay well you can't kyc you can't you know AML you can't have private it's like well you can build that on top of D5 it just won't be the D5 that we see today it'll be a very different version of it but you can still build that and that can still exist and it will still be better built on the crypto stack so I mean they're all these there are all these arguments that I think are are just incorrect um now speaking of speaking of defy I've even paying attention to these D5 1.0 pumps scratching my head a little bit I you know even bch ripped like 150 in the last few few days like what is going on uh I genuinely I do genuinely think that a lot of these things were just horrifically under owned I don't think any this they're like there's no speculative money in them the only people that held them were the people that were holding holding them for the long term the only sellers were the people that were already holding that were getting inflation that we're selling uh you know and and so I I think that this is really a less of a less of a fundamental move um I don't think anything has changed fundamentally for defy I just think that it was it was this massive effectively short squeeze and people woke up and they realized that they had zero D5 exposure and that it's possible um I think one Downstream uh one Downstream effect of the ETF getting approved is that some people are speculating that this is happening because the SEC is being told hey loosen up on crypto I have no insight into that okay to hold by sister you know the Biden Administration hey loosen up on crypto um I have no insight into this but that similar thesis actually to to yours which I assumed was just me being lazy and not doing the research I just assumed like hey something that's been fire sold for over a year now at the D5 asset class FTX not helping all this stuff right things just go down only for a while then you then they go up a little bit you have a bear Market Rally from the low point you can say wow this is a big rally but in reality it's just you know when we after another year goes by we'll zoom out and look at this price action as a blip in a downtrend I I just assumed it was it was uh you know just that kind of fractal volatility in the midst of a bear market for a particular asset class I didn't think there was anything more to this but yeah worth talking about in case we're missing something obvious here I don't think we're missing anything obvious I I do especially think in in terms of bch and LTC uh well bch is a very tightly controlled I don't you know want to necessarily make any accusations but it is a very tightly controlled asset which means that it is very easy to move the price and so it's very easy to manufacture these types of these types of moves I think LTC tends to follow uh because what ends up what ends up happening in these in these situations is that you see a leader and then everybody piles on the secondary and one thing that I've learned time and time again like time and time again trading crypto is that it's super reflexive and so you almost never make as much money buying the laggard as you do the leader yeah so if you buy the laggard it's like a one to three day trade maybe and you're looking for like some level of convergence of like 10 to 15 20 especially in this environment but you're just you're not looking for the same returns as a leader and more likely than not the leader is going to outperform your laggard you know like people tend to crowd to the winner they don't they don't tend to they don't tend to buy buy the loser in hopes of ketchup as much unless you're talking about bull market like crazy full-on like things are pumping 100 left and right but even then you know so for example uh in this in this case um you know looking looking at defy uh I do think that a lot of it is um you know so so if I'm looking at the top performers today on my D5 list I've got GRT which I don't know why is up 14 I've got bit Dao which is going through a rebranding to mantle dial uh which is probably going to be that beneficial for it uh one thing that's interesting is that by bit has just like been such a winner out of all this but out of all this uh binance uh all these binance issues and then you've got you've got blur as well up there which I'm actually quite quite bullish on as well just because I'm bullish on nfts and I think nfts even call that D5 obvi or is that just nfts oh I it's like sort of beat nfgd fights like it's like a mix between the two got fracks you've got maker um a lot of these things I think were just uh just just super super tightly super tightly held assets yeah um you know he brought something interesting in there that I want to like kind of double click on um double alert on what are we Consultants we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna boil the ocean next from 30 000 feet we could uh I'm so sorry I I tried the corporate corporate life has killed you man one is real let's let's try that again all right something I wanted to think through a little bit more with you together Kumbaya let's talk together about nfts you wanna you wanna You Wanna Hold My Hand next yeah okay I'm see I'm seeing you next week yeah it's gonna be great it's been a while um it has uh so anyway um you mentioned blur the intersection of D5 app T's and you also mentioned something about uh how buying the lager is a terrible strategy and and earns you a tiny fraction of the return with an explosive multiple of the risk it's funny you mentioned those two things because the closest market to crypto when it comes to leaders and laggarts is the Art Market um what when you buy are all the people who are good at it and there are very few say you know buy the best artists and buy the best Pieces by the best artists do not do not mess with anything other than the best of the best everything else is garbage and that's a you know obviously it's hard to pick the best artists before they become too expensive and it's hard to pick their best pieces until their Styles become known but that is indeed the best way to invest in art and for at for nfts nfts being art like is there any other trade besides zombie punks Apes ape punks aliens punks like like I know azuki just just did something kind of crazy but is this just like totally to be ignored is the board ape Yacht Club dead does this lead lag relationship that you mentioned in crypto apply to nfts I don't think so um as much in in the form of I don't I don't necessarily think that it's true for something like a board eight or for an azuki or for things that were hot at a given time in the in the cryptosphere because I think what ends up happening is that uh you can think of these you can think of a lot of the profile picture nft projects as effectively you know brands that come in and out of style so you can think of them as like a Gucci or a Prada or a Versace and whoever has the best designer at any given moment whoever's producing the best stuff like an American Eagle comes in in the fashion out of fashion so it's like a reputation it's not like Picasso and Damien and and it's because the team behind them or like constantly doing things with the project right so a lot of the like board ape and azuki and like miladies and all these things are not uh where they are by virtue of what they are visually certainly not they're right they're they're there because of the community and the community can Wax and Wane in potency and and Effectiveness now though different story that you read my mind that's exactly what I was about to say fedenzas squiggles punks rocks different story who's here who's your favorite Trad artist if you had to pick one mine's friends okay I don't know that much about the traditional traditional art world I have gotten some I have gotten some exposure to it uh recently um you know I think that it's a fascinating it's a fascinating space I know a lot more about the gem and jewelry market than I do about the art like the Art Market uh I just like as as a half Indian half Jew I guess I kind of had to on my gym yeah I know I know a lot I know a lot a lot more about that uh and I'm actually quite I find I find it really fascinating tease though why are you bullish nfts teach me that first so on two they're they're really the really two things I don't think my thinking is is that differentiated yeah one is that I think as a crypto Market goes up the wealth effect people will want to display their wealth and they're going to not display it in the form of gaudy purchases in reality they're gonna buy gaudy things in the digital world uh and those are that that is going to be nfts people are going to take their money that they make and eat and they're going to go flex their rocks and fidenzas and squiggles and all sorts of other expensive things and it will become more accepted the other thing is that uh and this stays in our little crew of me and you and everybody listening to this podcast and everybody on my Twitter so I've uh you know made a couple I've made a few friends in the traditional art world in the in in the in the New York space and they have mentioned to me that nfts are something that they pay attention to now like it's not going away in the way that I thought it that I thought it might there's actually a gallery down the street from our London office uh called pace in Mayfair and so I bought my first piece really and we have a lot to talk about so they were they were showing nfts at that gallery and I do think that what's happening right now is that there's some semblance of acceptance from the traditional art world uh of of nfts um way way way way more than there was a year and a half ago uh in that because these things have stuck around people are like oh okay they're not going anywhere got it understood it's just more of like this uh immersion into culture and then there's actually there's actually a third Point here which is that nfts are expanding rapidly outside of just art so you have people like Nike introducing the Nike Swoosh you have Starbucks introducing their their nfts you have artists we actually invested in in one in one platform called fan three which is helping artist issue issue nfts at a greater scale I can't give away anything too much but they have a lot of really great DJs lined up to go issue nfts to give exclusive access to conferences to music uh they've got some uh athletes as well lined up and so people are now thinking about nfts in a much broader context than they were previously and I think that there's some pretty negative sentiment with respect to nfts right now in that ever most people are ignoring them uh I think the percentage of people in crypto that pay attention to nfts have dropped off a cliff precipitously but activity is picking up and acceptance is picking up so I you know I'm bullish me too um I'm bullish because I think we've come out of the uh you know in the technology hype cycle you have the technology is innovated then you have the peak of euphoria then you have the trough of disillusionment and then it uh plateaus out into the enlightenment phase um I think we were past the trough of disillusion with nfts maybe not with crypto more broadly but uh with nfts for sure I agree with you that they're they're sort of percolating into the Trot art world my big art Guru advisor is the um this game's Nathan and he runs the freeze Festival uh and I was having a conversation with him in Venice last year where we talked about what nfts could be in terms of traditional art and frankly the most interesting thing to me is if anybody who owns our has to own a certificate of authenticity uh to effectively authenticate their piece and that document is just printed on a piece of paper it could be for uh forged it's effectively a piece of garbage right it wouldn't it be better if all art were an nft effectively with a physical print and so uh by the way that that's how I feel about so many things what the heck is going on why yeah why the heck would I yeah why are you gonna try something why do I have a deed a piece of paper that says that I own this thing yes it's in a registry as well yeah but if I lose the deed it's still a headache exactly why is it still a safety deposit box somewhere these Deeds still last like oh this is actually a da Vinci that no one real or is it a da Vinci you know this this like thing that this uh Salvatore Mundy that that Prince Salman uh brought bought for 500 million dollars like what if there had been an nft that was associated with that certificate of authenticity um you know rather than being registered with the bank of of Northern Italy five or six hundred years ago when it was created you know it was just put on some chain it lasted forever like that's how art art ownership and ownership of anything should be stored is there a company you would trust with the certificate of authenticity of your art or the deed to your house like I wouldn't want to trust some startup or even Microsoft with that I would you know I'd prefer to just have it on Chase frankly and so a business idea for any of you entrepreneurial crypto people out there um if anyone wants to create this startup please give Avi and or myself a call um goes two ways first of all nft uh on chain certificates of authenticity for Trad art and the ref also the opposite of that which is a service for wealthy Trad our collectors who buy from galleries they don't want to go into a metamask and deal with anything they just want to sign they want to DocuSign something and then own their art so basically secure uh Secure Storage for nfts that are owned by you know that are bought at Trad art galleries um that sort of dual service I think is a real crypto business that needs to exist and if anyone's creating it uh hit us up yeah I I would agree wholeheartedly but I don't know how he got stuck on this topic of talking about art I don't if that hit it big I think I think if goes up because again it's a use case for for the chain speaking of BTC where's it going right now let's time stamp it it's .064 yeah uh and so let me preface this with on the last podcast we talked about being bearish BTC up until the ETF launch we talk about being bearish alt up until the ETF launch since then also have actually done okay um btcdi I do think is up since the podcast but there are some select alts that have done that I've done all right and I'm personally I personally over the last two weeks have changed my opinion and got longer eth BTC uh and have bought bought each full full disclosure and I've also you know bought other other alternate I still really like my my favorite trades in the world are still gbtc ethi Stacks which I think is just it's it's going up uh and then BTC upside but we did buy uh other other alts over the last over the last two weeks um because I do think that especially if BTC gets stuck in this in this range we're going to see some we're going to see some outperformance but the I think so the main question is canif BTC keep up if BTC keeps going up I think no it absolutely can't so here's the thing I think one of the I think the best trade in crypto is long gbtc and the reason why is unlike trading we talked a little bit about this last week unlike Trad markets where there's just more than enough Capital to pre prehedge pretty much any type of announcement or anticipated information that's widely known there isn't like there just isn't enough money that can get into crypto to pre-position for what a BlackRock ETF approval would would bring in right so because of that there is a fundamental mispricing in the crypto Market anybody who can buy Bitcoin right now spot uh or gbtc absolutely has that have you know has the ability to get ahead of a potential BlackRock ETF approval which I think would set the price up and the reason why the price isn't up uh in a probabilistically weighted way already is like I said because it's hard for Capital to get into crypto right now uh either because the the pathways the gateways or or the will or the risk appetite is just lacking so I think gbtc is the best trade just to respond to your question about where does the hbtc go uh like where do you think I don't know where it goes from here but what I'm confident it in is that if you wait for an ETF approval and the ETF the BlackRock ETF gets approved um you that's when you buy right I think it said by dip buy I don't think it's a buy right now here's my cynical take on the matter Jonah I don't think the ETF drives uh truly meaningful flows I think I think I think that it drives semi-meaningful flows I mean maybe a few billion maybe like three four billion in in flows I think a significant amount of that unfortunately is offset by people that own gbtc and would redeem and then get out of the trade because there are funds right now that own gbdc outright and will when approved just drain gbtc of their Bitcoin and just get out of the trade yes there are a lot that own gbdc in a market neutral fashion but there are a lot that just own it outright uh basically willing to take the price risk of Bitcoin uh and when that trade when that Gap closes they're just out and I do think they're gonna be some time that goes by in between a perspective a potential BlackRock ETF approval and when you can get redeem your genetc uh probably but probably no Domino's no but I don't think it would be very long yeah um and so I I do think that this is Lowe's I do think that those flows somewhat somewhat offset uh and I do think that there a lot of flows are front run too and so net I don't know how many flows come in I think it's a net positive for BTC over a long period of time but my bet is that here's my take on the matter if an ETF is approved it looks very very very similar to the Futures ETF approval where it tops effectively on the day of the ETF approval eth runs after and catches up really hard and then both top together for a foreseeable time period then we go sideways and then in q1 24 having we start going up again that's my that's my that is my view on the market is that ETF is a sale eth goes up then you sell eth you pivot and then you sell well I think you buy a little bit of Youth now but then then you pivot really hard and eat and then you sell everything like a week later and then you just wait for the having to get closer and then you walk away a much wealthier man or woman that that that's my view it you know I like that view because I think it's one of those times and you know my style Lobby it's a little different than yours I think it's one of those times where your style works better where you really have to trade actively you can't just sit on your hands right you have to be you have to be nimble and you have to be willing to commit size and you have to be willing to act when everybody is either fearful or euphoric and yeah I think I think it's as simple it's really as simple as when everybody's panicking you buy when everybody's euphoric you sell and I can guarantee you with 100 certainty that on ETF approval everybody is going to be absolutely euphoric euphoric BTC panicking youth BTC and then you buy BTC about a newborn then that's when you buy it you dip by it after an approval and then you pivot although right now that but that's also why by the way I bought uh each BTC at like 61662 area uh because I noticed that the price of eth and this is where you know I trade somewhat lower time frame but the the price of eth was not correlating with the sentiment and one of my favorite trades to take is and and this is harder to quantify but there are a couple of good services that you can use to quantify I like the tie a lot actually me too so shout out to Josh Frank great product Shout out to Josh Frank uh yeah great guy great product um I think I have to disclose it we are investors but I actually do like the product so what I did notice is that there is a Divergence so on Wednesday when's from Wednesday June 28th to Friday June 30th each sentiment just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and everybody hated it but price was flat it was not going down anymore and when I see that I like to start nibbling I like to start buying it's the same same uh same reason I bought bought a little bit of blur um you know post uh post post nuke is because I view I see blur you know capturing a larger portion of nft volumes every day they're the lar they they have a lot of volumes that are running through them they're doing well nft volumes are doing great new products new projects are coming out but the sentiment on our NFC is like where wherever we go nobody care about these things anymore so I see I see a sentiment sentiment Divergence there um I think D5 was probably similar it's like post the SEC coming after coinbase everybody thought that D5 would just get absolutely nuked and since nothing has happened it's just going up again um that that actually now that I'm thinking about it more might be might be one of the reasons for up uh but yeah uh you know I want to um I want to wrap up the podcast with some there's a general views and general thoughts around the market uh you know just just hot high level where where do you think we're going over the next over the next six months over the next 12 months okay so great question I think that Parts Little Parcels of the crypto Market are looking more like like to your point that you just made rational sort of Trad markets uh where you know best to be greedy when others are fearful best to be fearful when others are greedy mean reverting you know buy dips sell pops like really uh really kind of sensible markets the two Mega Trend assets that I I think you know it would be it would be dangerous to make the you know Jonah Circa 10 years ago mistake selling Bitcoin selling Facebook stock equivalent would be selling Bitcoin or selling eats right now I think we are in the midst of a multi-decade uptrend in those two assets and so if you I think if you invest in a way that allows you to remain on the mechanical bolt and not get thrown off I I think that that's that's you know the trade I think other things like nfts D5 they've been fire sold probably time to buy other things that are looking a little a little frothy a little a little hot maybe mean coins uh you know light up yeah I think I think I think that's I think that's uh that's a line I think you know I I do think that we're out in inflection inflection point for Bitcoin where and we're talking as if the ETF is definitely going to get approved I you know I put it at 75 chance that it gets approved but I think we're at an inflection point where it just becomes an institutionalized asset class and it becomes something that is just not that's just not going away and that solidifies in my mind the incoming bubble because there's still a lot of people that don't have exposure there's still a lot of people that have written it off but it hasn't gone away and it's it's not going away and youth continues to pick up to pick up traction and so the way that the way that I view this is I view the next the next few months is solidifying the base for crypto to allow for a crazy run in 24 and 25. I agree with you of course a lot of this is an investment advice tokens are risky do your own research um you know really really appreciate you listening in to to our views but they are just our our opinions not again not not advice never Financial advice because I would never do that I appreciate talking with you as always I'm super excited to see you in London maybe we'll even do a podcast in person maybe we'll do an impromptu sit across the table drop a special a special episode you can get your kids involved I actually think that'll be that would be that would be great you know we'll ask the listeners if they want it get some Sony Watts takes there yep one one syllable two syllable taken all right Jonah catch up soon [Music] foreign [Music]

Transcript Text:
there's a book behind me right now called the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros and basically I can sum up the book in one word which is everything is reflexive that didn't sound like one word Avi ah the two words everything reflexivity one [Music] welcome back to another episode of the Thousand X podcast we are excited to have you we are recording this at the exact same moment that Bitcoin has decided to send we are trading 29 8 and both Joan and I are extremely happy right now and I hope you guys are too there's a lot to talk about on today's podcast a lot has happened in the markets and there are a lot of opportunities that are presented themselves and I think the last two weeks since our novograts podcast we've done a pretty good job at navigating the turn and so happy to talk to you about what's happened and what we think is going to happen over the next uh few weeks so without further Ado let's Dive In Jonah how's it how's it been where are you right now I'm in France hello from France bonjour um I'm sorry to hear broadcasting live from uh from a crappy laptop with some trees in the background it's um the price of Bitcoin is is the same here in France it's uh almost thirty thousand but you know a little farther away in euros um I kind of hope we hit 30k in the middle of the podcast which seems possible we're flirting with it if we had 30k in the middle in the middle of the podcast I think we should uh I think we should do is just a little toast and then we should sell everything that we own yeah because this this is the moment you know the price I think you just got to get out it's over yeah I mean this is an emotional roller coaster two weeks ago we were talking to novograts we asked him hey you know why why did you why did you start a company instead of just holding you know length in your PA and he was like ah great question you know it it's stressful times for people who run crypto businesses right now um but the sentiment can shift quickly you know two two weeks ago is all about the SEC dropping lawsuits on coinbase and binance uh it looked like we were primed for a washout lower Abby what did the uh what did the short interest look like um at that time I mean at the at the lows before we squeezed higher we were looking at more than a billion dollars of shorts that had opened USD yeah a billion of shorts that opened on the usdt contracts and that's actually what if you remember on the law on the last podcast with Novo we were both talking about lifting August and September calls on BTC when you evolved below 40. and you have a billion dollars of shorts that have entered the market that is recipe for disaster for those shorts and recipe for volatility I think that Vol is actually still really low one of the things that I like to remind people is that vault is often the most mispriced post a large move so you you can make an argument that Vol is more mispriced now at 50 than it was at 40 when we were at the lows because we've already seen such a large move and 30k is very likely to be is much more likely than 25k to be an unstable price right it's very much you know more common for Bitcoin to oscillate wildly after it's already oscillated wildly than for it to begin to oscillate wildly and so you can make a make a case that Vol here actually makes sense I mean one thing that I was looking at is if you want to take off some length you could sell Deltas but you can also start buying buying some puts because puts are still pretty cheap I mean if you if you want to bet you could sell call spreads too roll your strikes up yeah that's true could sell could sell call spreads although the actually actually that I I hadn't looked at that but that actually looks really nice because it looks like uh we've got some we've got some points on the spread now whereas before the the surface is pretty flat yep I mean I think what's what's interesting here you brought up a really good point about options and I was an options specialist for over a decade that's uh that was the the primary way that I expressed views and I really dug deep into it you you made a very insightful point which I agree with which is options are often the most mispriced after large moves and the way that they get missed price is something that's kind of worth delving into because what you just described where Vol still seems a bit too low um often it's the other way you get a big move and Vol explodes and then it's just a screaming sale right uh like for example the big trade in Commodities this year has been to sell overpriced options which exploded after last year's craziness across gas oil a bunch of other markets so Vol remained overvalued for far too long and that's usually what happens after there's excitement in a market after in a paradigm of oh my God it's a super cycle wait no it's not or wow this thing's going to zero oh wait no it's not it's just going to mean revert again that's those are those are when you know when you have eyeballs on an asset class fall remains too high for too long after a big move meanwhile in crypto I think people just threw in the towel like the market stopped moving and I think a lot of institutional players who are more Savvy at valuing options than perhaps your average retail investor because options are complicated and it's not it's not you know math they teach you in high school um you know the opposite happened right you had some huge opportunities some huge moves some you know some lots of coiled Springs in the market and yet the cheapest volatility ever uh implied volatility ever which you know you could go and buy um and you know as as a wise Trader once told me you never buy options unless you expect the market to move fast sounds so obvious but a lot of people miss it and markets move fast when you get a short squeeze seems like that's what happened yeah 100 I think that that's really what you're looking for when I mean the really there are two things that I look for when I'm buying when I'm buying these types of buying these types of calls one is I'm just looking for why I think well you have to always frame with every trade but it's it's sometimes very very straightforward with options is why I think it's mispriced like why do I think I have why do I think I have edge here and specifically with this most recent bout it was because there's a natural supply of sellers in the options market and who is selling right so the miners it's people looking for yield on their Bitcoin people that run you know they're these billion dollar instructor products out there and we've talked about all this so I don't necessarily need to rehash it uh in in depth but there's a natural Supply and so when the bid side dries up when there are no institutional funds in uh and when there are no when there's no retail coming into cross across the spread you just get this fall depression and then when you see just an insane amount of shorts in the market you kind of you kind of have to start lifting I mean it's funny I think that six out of six times and I can I might tweet out a graph with this one of my analysts put it together within 48 to 72 hours of fud we've generally seen the bottom in terms of actual price on bitcoin Bitcoin and ethereum and I think what's been happening is that there seems to be some leakage of news and you get this weird movement in the markets prior to the actual headlines dropping where you stuff just starts to trade really weirdly and I think five or six times this year I've turned to Joe my partner I've said the Market's trading like there's news coming out and then within two days news has come out it's very very odd very very odd trade very odd trading Dynamic uh and then so what ends up happening is then very quickly a lot of it gets priced in because the only people left in this market that are actually trading are people that pay attention to these types of headlines and that generally provides a good opportunity to come in and actually buy and so it's it's been a pretty high hit rate I had kind of a different take on that from you I'm I came to the same conclusion but a very different way I mean I do not unlike you I do not have a good track record of buying fud um because often FUD at least you know again I'm I'm newer to this market so the definition of fud is weird for me um no one uses that term in other markets and furthermore what constitutes fud what constitutes fear uncertainty and doubt like I don't have a historical reference point in my mind from having traded this asset class for so long like you have to know whether some things like officially the point where most people are throwing in the towel or whether it's the beginning of this Cascade of negative headlines and sentiment uh souring that's just going to continue and send the price lower and lower um for me what what signaled you know some confidence while we were trading on the lows and I'm not going to go and pretend that I I did anything particularly heroic but um what signaled confidence is that when the SEC dropped these final two lawsuits against coinbase and finance you know two very well resourced um institutions that you know can afford to fight they're not just going to fold their hands um you know just having had a little bit of legal experience in in my own past from you know having been involved in a lawsuit or two uh usually when the plaintiff files a lawsuit this has nothing to do with the SEC when the plaintiff files a lawsuit that's their moment of Max momentum they've gone and stated all of their claims they've laid their case out the way that they want it to be viewed um no defense has been formed the defendant is often you know caught off guard and it's really you know just from a textbook law school theoretical perspective it's hard it's you know that is Max momentum you know it couldn't get any the momentum couldn't have been further against crypto than it was at that particular point I think that's a really solid way of framing it and I think that that's accurate I think the way that I would add on to that to frame it for myself is when you have an action that is somewhat you know that that effectively so with operation showpoint let me walk this back with operation choke point which was the SEC coming after altcoins there was no a vet as much as there was this ongoing drip of attack it's like okay we we might just continue to see actions by the SEC against a variety different all coins we don't know when that's going to end it might last for a year it might last for six months it might last for three months with the SEC lawsuit against binance and coinbase that was very much so an event yeah right it was it was very much so hey here is this thing this very concrete lawsuit that I mean if they've sued binance and they've sued coinbase doesn't really matter who they sue next those are the two largest exchanges in existence right now I mean maybe they can sue you know will be or okx but that's going to be baked into baked into price right to your point is every action beyond that is less meaningful because they've sort of played their hand okay we're going after the largest exchange offshore we're going after the largest exchange on shorts so then you start to think okay well how how could it get worse there are a few things that could have made it worse for example the doj could still come out against binance but I actually think that at this point that's almost baked into price if I see I mean some actionable you know just some something actionable no I'm not saying necessarily do this but this is how I how I would think about it is if a headline comes out uh that you know cz's being perp walked that probably is a three to six percent sell-off and I actually think that that's almost baked in people know that that is a potential I think don't worry like if you read Twitter the worry about the doj is that let's say they come after binance and say you have done something wrong um they in theory have the power to freeze Omnibus wallets right they can say this this wallet this binance wallet has conducted activity that we don't like we're gonna freeze it while we do our investigation and again you know not this is not my view it's just you you read Twitter you get these sorts of ideas in your head um if customer assets were to be frozen temporarily like this this wouldn't be a you know an SPF situation where assets are gone this is more like hey a government agency is temporarily halted activity in a certain wallet and customers can't access their funds or they're they're you know Frozen firm a day or a week then liquidity in the system gets gunked up very difficult for institutional trading to take place and you could see some some pretty some pretty terrifying price movements so I think that like the prospect of that is maybe a reason why if you're long gamma and you you just you've just ridden it up to 30k from 25k Bitcoin and you're feeling pretty good about yourself maybe that's the you know a reason to lighten up on some deltas and but I mean who who knows this is pure this is just pure idea generation Trader talk what could go wrong you know Avi and I are just sitting here you know for the listeners just sort of more gaming ideas about what could go wrong what could go right we have no idea right so you know these probability analyzes are pretty speak for yourself um yeah my whole my whole my whole job my whole job is to have an idea Jonah I never said it's a good idea but I do I do have so I do have some ideas maybe we should do what Don Wilson said and model out the probability distributions of you know worst case that's how you're supposed to do everything in trading everything's a probability at the end of the day and then you start to calculate the EV from the probability and then you make decisions and your best you know your best outcome that's one of the reasons why I think we were both you know so heavily involved in this recent gbtc run-up is yeah because it it was it was the most post BlackRock filing it just made the most sense right I mean if you're gonna if you're gonna bet one of the most important things that you can do when you have a trade in your mind or when you have an idea in your mind is how do you best construct that trade so you might say that oil is going up or you might think that copper is going up or you might think that bitcoin's going up and then you think of the reasons why it might be going up and then you think of the best way to construct that trait so with the grayscale sorry with the uh BlackRock filing the BET was that Bitcoin has probably reached a point where it's out of sellers in the short term because of the you know everybody that's exited on binance and coinbase has probably exited by now and that a lot of buyers might come in because of this Prospect of a ETF filing and so what do you think is going to benefit the most from that well there's this great instrument gbtc that if turned into an ETF is currently was currently trading at a 40 discount which I think is a discount code yeah it's it's a it's a yeah I see 32 33 33 yeah and uh a seven if the price of Bitcoin doesn't move a seven percent rally in the discount uh when it from forty percent to 33 is the equivalent of what I said I can't do this math like 18 rally and the underlying asset like it's meaningful you get this this is a positively convex asset it's an option it's just like an option you pay a premium which is that two percent management fee uh and then in in return for that you get something that sort of yeah and the discount hormonal at a 40 discount just going to par with no price movement from Bitcoin means you get a 60 I think 65 66 percent return so it was just such a great it was just such a great trade because you know why people are buying and so when you construct the trade you think to yourself all right I want to be bullish on bitcoin I think the crypto Market's going up what is my highest conviction trade here well gbtc seemed like a great one because after we did talk about this by the way we did talk about it on the podcast this isn't because just looking back and saying we we bought this one after it rallied we actually now I think I think I've talked about GBC on like every single podcast that I'm on because I just I just think it's it was such an it's such an obvious trade at some point um you know especially when it got to 40 45 50 it was just such a it was just such an interesting thing to have have in the book I think ethi is at a 46 discount right now that one's a lot tougher for me mainly because the bet is effectively on the SEC approving a ETF uh I just think that there's a much lower probability of it getting approved as a as an as an ETF then then Bitcoin because of all the concerns around it being being a security and whatnot and realistically you know I'm not I'm no I'm no legal expert uh but I can read body language and the body language of the SEC is that they don't really uh you know believe that anything is uh other than other than BTC is safe uh you know and I think they've pretty much explicitly explicitly said that and kensler has said that uh multiple times obviously there's going to be a jurisdictional battle over this because the cftc has said some things and the SEC has said some things but anyway all of that to say gbtc was was was more attractive than ethi because of those because of those reasons and the um the move I think has has reflected has reflected that I think in gbtc you will get the discount selling off again at some point and the reason why is um dcg we don't know if the managers of dcg are economically rational and that's the only thing that they care about or whether they also have reputational you know things they want to uphold or other sort of incentives in there other stakeholders if they're if they're purely economically rational in on you know in theory the textbook says they should just do nothing because the amount basically the the net asset value of that fund is determined by the number of Bitcoins that are held inside of it um all of that was created when gbtc traded at a premium back in 2021 and before now whatever the price of gbtc does it doesn't change the amount of fees that that grayscale collects it's really just the price of Bitcoin going up and down that alters their fee they collect two percent of the Bitcoin held in the fund every year um so In from from their perspective right okay blackrock's filing for an ETF um you know maybe they should feel like they're supposed to compete but they don't really have to even if the price of gbtc gets fire sold to down to a discount of minus 90 technically they're still collecting those same fees and then if that happens because everybody's sick of waiting for a grayscale to apply for an ETF and they just sell all their gbtc into a vacuum and rotate into the the BlackRock instrument which is much better theoretically if it gets approved um then grayscale could go and buy you know buy their own shares back at a massive discount and then convert to an ETF and or or redeem or offer redemptions and earn 20 years worth of 20 years worth of fees in in one Fell Swoop that mean that would be a scummy thing to do to your investors but if you're just purely economically rational that actually makes sense to do that so I think there is some risk to the downside there you know yeah yes I think you'd have to I think they'd open themselves up to a tremendous amount of class action lawsuits uh yeah I think they don't like I don't know but I'm not a lawyer I don't know whether maybe this is watertight who knows I I by the way I mean you're right that's 100 correct that would be if there were no legal risk or reputational risk my bet is that that probability is extremely low because they're trying they're trying to build a business and have a long-term business as opposed to a short-term uh you know as opposed to generating a lot of cash in the in the short term and nobody's doubting that if they care about their reputation and they want to build a business they shouldn't do that um it's an interesting thought experiment I just think it's highly exactly yeah I mean I and and especially because they've they've come out there and said so many times that they're attempting to get uh you know they're attempting to trans transform this into into an ETF that being said a lot of people have done a lot of worse things in crypto also agreed and let's let's look at the flip side let's say you're managing gbtc and BlackRock comes out with a product that's infinitely Superior no matter how hard you try to please your investors they're still going to sell gbtc and rotate into um the BlackRock one um let's say they offer redemptions they just the Golden Goose is dead their gbtc is going to get redeemed and the assets are going to get rotated into something more you know well I teach I think I think we're we're also underestimating that laziness of your average investor in this product I think that there's probably a substantial amount of money money that stays in that ETF and because it's the largest and because it's the oldest it might actually end up and because it already has a ton of volume uh associated with it it may actually just end up being the main ETF and then that opens up you know maybe maybe the asset's actually 10x I mean one of the nice things about uh the BlackRock filing is that it gives an air of legitimacy to the asset class into Bitcoin and to bitcoin specifically and the other thing is that if blackrock's filing for for an ETF they probably have a reasonable understanding of the probability that that ETF is going to get approved which I would place it fairly High considering that there's a decent economic cost to going after uh and producing the CTF and then once it's approved the way that BlackRock works is that they incentivize their advisors to go sell their products and so we're going to have we're going to have a lot of people trying to sell a Bitcoin ETF for BlackRock from a top line cost it's not from a monetary cost I don't think it's particularly expensive I think it's more from the you know why why would they go through all the effort to go out there and try to get this try to get this thing approved I think from you know from a reputational standpoint they've got a pretty good uh track record at getting getting ETFs ETFs approved I don't think it looks particularly great if they try to get a Bitcoin ETF approved the SEC comes out and says well actually the Bitcoin markets are manipulated and then people look at BlackRock no were you trying to get us into a product that's manipulated it just doesn't yeah you know it just doesn't it more more expensive from a reputational standpoint than from a monetary standpoint uh I also think that that's a good point I also think that it's highly likely that a lot of these problems have been are in the process of being so a portion of the filing had an entire there was entire section dedicated to Market surveillance and every time that the SEC has rejected a Bitcoin ETF it has been because they have claimed that the markets are manipulated I think that the SEC coming after coinbase and binance is going to help out tremendously on this point of getting an ETF passed because there's going to be more regulatory oversight around exchanges uh and second BlackRock is introducing some Market surveillance uh for for Bitcoin and that should help uh with respect to with respect to you know perceived perceived manipulation in in the markets I think the last Point can't be understated people are once this thing is approved there are going to be a lot of people out there whose job it is uh you know to is is now to sell Bitcoin a Bitcoin ETF who probably historically have not really cared that much about Bitcoin and so you know there's it's just access to it to a lot of capital which is why I think that uh you know if you're if you're here I look at long dated uh wingy options is a very very good trade right now because it's possible uh that you know it's it's it's possible that what ends up happening is that once it once it gets approved you get it you get a stampede into the asset class now I think that from a Trader's perspective uh I'm uh I'm a I'm a seller of eth BTC up until the moment the ETF is approved and then I'm probably lifting as much BTC as I possibly can uh in the book uh you know I think that Eve is is under a lot of pressure right now because it's lost it's lost the narrative but that'll shift at some point uh you know I'm looking at 0.5 to 0.55 as a level to start scooping up either for the long term interesting that's uh that's a good way of thinking about it I mean I think obviously it's it's exciting to the prospect of having registered investment advisors and institutional you know BlackRock people going and selling the idea of Bitcoin as a portfolio hedge and a you know a diversification holding um to me I think what's more interesting about it the most interesting from the long side is let's say you're an institution right now what are your options to get long Bitcoin like let's say that you're you're listening to the Thousand X podcast you're you're bullish crypto your bullish Bitcoin really you don't care about alts um you know what do you buy right you can buy spot that's not Capital efficient if you want to buy a million dollars worth of bitcoin you have to spend a million dollars and park it somewhere right um commodity Futures interest rate features don't work like that it's much more Capital efficient okay fine so you go by and you go and buy some Bitcoin futures um you know they trade 50 to 100 basis points over spot during rallies and then they just converge back down so you just keep having this negative roll down that eats up all of your Capital efficiency and then some in certain circumstances you probably you know if you're you're a U.S domestic finance company or a London Finance Company maybe you aren't necessarily comfortable trading perps on binance um but there's just or there's gbtc which is this weird thing that is a little bit hard to understand the discount is super volatile and you're not exactly sure what grayscale like how much they care about their stakeholders and how much they care about fee collection you don't know whether they'll convert to an ETF and do you know good faith efforts or not you even if you assume the best you have to prepare for the worst or bacon a probability of the worst there's just not a lot of good ways to get long Bitcoin in 2023 which is crazy a BlackRock ETF would be like the the gold standard of getting long Bitcoin and you could do it in a very Capital efficient portfolio margin way with the rest of your ETFs well you know uh you know what we haven't been talking about at all on this podcast about alts zero zero talk about it because I I'm still under the impression that it's just so it's going to be such a dead period for all it's I mean how many how many how many apps are supposed to buy fud it's just been like if you chart any major all like polka dot algo Rand cardano all these major did you genuinely just lead off with polka dot any mate did you did you actually just do that Jonah polka dot is I I have looked at the charts and yes I did polka dot is a particularly smooth downtrend versus each so that's why I started with that one like Solana's a little choppier you'd have a harder time hanging on to to a short in that one I mean I I think I think polka dot is uh I haven't heard a single thing on a polka dot in well that's just it right look at the chart polka dot versus Ethan coin gecko or trading view or something and yes I just said coin gecko too um you no coin gecko's good you didn't say move this downtrend I've ever seen um so at what point at what point in alt space do you say all right we're at Peak fud maybe it's time to buy could it be and you know going back to regulation and lawsuits and stuff could it be um there is a scenario in the distribution where the SEC just straight up loses to Ripple and the judge says xrp is not a security then what do alts do then then alts probably Rip but I don't think they rip until that happens because you need you need retail to come back in and Retail is nowhere to be found and institutions are not going to be buying any of this stuff and the reality is most of these things aren't that useful and we've talked about this before on the previous podcast with with Novo it's like we're in the show me we're in the show me phase most of these things are not there are a couple of things that are obviously useful and then most of them are just trash and so you get you get to this point where who who is going to be buying them and for and for what reasons I think a lot of people in 2021 tried to make Arguments for I'm buying these for fundamental reasons but the fundamentals have died on a lot of alts right now and probably aren't coming back uh and so I think that we're we're just we're just in a situation where until you get some sort of positive news about altcoins you're gonna have pockets about outperformance I think you're going to have specific alts that do well I think you're going to have you know for example something like a Stax which is tied to bitcoin and Regulatory compliant is actually seems to be right now like how people are choosing to voice alt beta which is kind of interesting um you know it's like people that would probably normally buy a large swath of alts or kind of sticking to a smaller universe uh which I which makes which makes sense to me and they're going to be things that you know are going to be useful so for example uh you look at arbitrum or you look at optimism with uh four four eight four four coming up and that those alts probably those alts probably do well but and maybe maybe even something like a like a Matic I don't know if you guys saw recently but their nft drop with Nike is now integrated into fortnite and that seemed to fly under fly under the radar a bit and Matic has been performing performing pretty badly but it seems like that you know there's at least some traction that's organically coming up again uh and so I think that they're going to be select out performers but in aggregate the complex probably doesn't do particularly well and you probably just you probably don't do well uh buying alts for example as a BTC rotation play until either a beats these at 35 to 40 in which case retail comes back in or you get that uh you know xrp uh xrp headline that comes out that says hey xrp is not a security and so that sort of game of alt hot potato that game that you would play in 21 is probably just going to be very hard to come by right now and you probably need to actually go do some work and then not rely on the work of others because it's very easy to get dumped on by crypto Twitter like a lot a lot of the times I I see alts that are talked about on crypto Twitter super actively end up being the worst performers all coins I mean I I missed the altcoin season I I joined this Market too late it's been Bitcoin season since I joined and honestly I think you're right like you can't you can't just buy a basket like a market cap weighted basket of altcoins and then hope that works as sort of a BTC rotation trade because then literally you are buying things like polka dot which are still up there in market cap like these these aren't small Eco like ecosystems from a market cap perspective but from a relevance and like potential perspective they're they're utterly irrelevant when you're dealing with custody uh there's this concept of a qualified custodian you want to keep your assets with a with a qualified custodian you want to make sure you're adhering to the rules as best as best as as best as you possibly can and so let's say you have a token in a metamask or in fire blocks or in another in another custodian that isn't technically deemed a qualified qualified custodian uh currently and you compare that to a secondary transaction on you know in in PE so you go out there you buy stock of you buy stock of company a from uh from an investor who invested in the series a uh they haven't raised their their series B yet you go buy that from the uh from the investor how do you like how do you actually own that like what do you actually own you basically have a bunch of contracts that are signed that may hopefully hold up and hopefully are totally fine in most cases do hold up perfectly fine but you basically just have like a Siri you have an email chain and you have a bunch of documents with no Version Control and then maybe a ledger or maybe they use uh what is it called um Carta maybe they have that right and so how do you know that you actually own this thing and the answer is it's a little tough well if you own a token in your metamask you verifiably own that thing you know that you own it you are the holder of that token and so there are a lot of things about crypto that just makes sense like I can very easily foresee a future where all private transactions all public Securities transactions all of it is represented on the ethereum blockchain because it just is a better overall system uh what that doesn't mean is that the SEC coming after crypto is killing crypto which just changes crypto and so what you end up with is you end up with probably something like an Ave or a Solana or a name insert alt that the SEC has said is a security just having their token trade publicly as a security and they just register as a security security doesn't mean illegal it doesn't mean fraud right it just literally means okay go register go register as a security Now there may or may not be some tokens that work as a security and there may or may not be some tokens that don't work as a security and well there are there are definitely tokens that work as a security they're definitely tokens that don't and so some business models will die some business models will adapt some will change this by no means the end of crypto uh and that this is also something by the way that we've been discussing for a long time is the bifurcation of crypto into the regulated kyc institutional type crypto and then the offshore kind of crazy Underground Market of crypto that's probably going to still exist and both of those things are going to exist in parallel and there's kind of no way to stop that that's probably a good thing um yeah I agree you know you'll end up with um you know that there will be Bridges between the two but those bridges will be heavily regulated um and perhaps those bridges will have lower take rates than the bridges that act between you know developing and developed markets right now like I you know again I'm just going to go back to Commodities because that's that's my comfort zone trading houses like trafficura and vital act as a you know an intermediary between places where there's a surplus of of Commodities which is often you know places where JP Morgan won't do business Iraqi Kurdistan um Chad right and then places where there's a deficit like uh China again where JP Morgan won't do business or France where they will right and um frankly those intermediaries get paid spectacularly to intermediate and um because they're sort of regulated and legally compliant I think blockchains sort of fulfill similar functions where you can have you know you can have certain chains that that are popular in markets that are less you know sort of friendly to American regulatory oversight and other markets which which are you know very compliant and you'll have very regulated bridges in between the two with lower take rates um also I think that what you mentioned about how some you know some tokens will just be Securities and that's fine couldn't agree more I mean you have exchanges like NASDAQ that can list both both um Securities and non-securities like Commodities so there are already venues that exist that are able to to sort of list both types of products you could have Bitcoin and you know some some token that's a security on the same exchange you know same liquidity so maybe in terms of the business models to your point about certain business models changing or getting disrupted maybe the exchange landscape looks a lot different in 10 years as a result of this sort of regulatory picture maybe you maybe you end up with uh I don't know if we you know I don't know if it's NASDAQ or edx the new Citadel and fidelity thing or or you know one of these other new venues that really comes and competes with coinbase and binance but it feels like there's there's room for for a new player or two yeah there's definitely there's definitely room for a new player and I don't think by the way I don't think it's a coincidence that all this regulatory action is coming out uh coming out now um oh look we just tagged 30k just as a let's operate and sell everything now the drink this glass of water maybe something else later finish oh I'll finish my coffee uh it's funny you know there's a there's a there's a book behind me right now called the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros and basically I can sum up the book in one word which is everything is reflexive that didn't sound like one word obvi which ah the two words everything reflexivity like one word and I think that that's very true right now um you know the more the more the Bitcoin goes up the more that people believe the ETF is going to go through and the more people are going to buy buy Bitcoin and the more people are going to believe the ETF goes through and then the more pressure people Blackhawk is probably going to put on the SEC get this thing through uh and so it's you know it's a it's sort of a sort of a virtuous virtuous cycle right now I think the only thing that um has made me a little bit nervous about this rally is just that uh the equity markets have gone the opposite way so NASDAQ NASDAQ is down a percent uh you know snps down down 50 bips and so I'm keeping a close eye on that uh I will say that coins got a lot of catching up to do with the NASDAQ which just took off and left Bitcoin in the dust so I agree which is why Jonas is baked in which is why I'm not as worried but I am keeping an eye on it um with that being said there are a couple of interesting bullish data points out there that you know we have a macro team that we pay attention to uh every so this happened uh on the last inflation print in May if you look out one year from when the FED funds rate crossed over the uh last in inflation print the one year return from the s p uh was 13 percent and the two-year return is 31 percent and that's 31 on the two-year that's 31 versus an average of you know I think 15 over the time period that the study the study was tracked uh and so there is some evidence that um there's just general bullishness in the in in the market in the market to come that we have inflation under control and that this actually sets up for a very nice environment for Bitcoin to tag uh to tag 40K uh that being said I'm still a seller on the headline that UTF is approved I'm definitely I'm definitely a seller try to buy back in a little bit lower uh me too I'm not headline so you know all that all that all that with a grain of salt yeah pretty cool that it just tagged 30k though in the middle of the podcast um that settles our bet from the previous podcast uh several podcasts ago where we said hey is it gonna hit 24 31st we both said 24. and here we are trading 30k I I think you're supposed to sell a BlackRock ETF approval headline as well um to be to be covered a bit lower like a tactical type trade I think over time you know in general like in in thinking about pre-positioning for fairly well telegraphed headlines and events um I have a fairly bad track record of it in tradfy but in crypto it seems to work and I think the reason why is it's like everybody and their mother knows the having is coming next year everybody's probably right that BlackRock will get their their ETF approval eventually at some point sure you can get long ahead of those things and in Trad Phi you would and the markets would price it in almost immediately and then when the event occurs it's kind of a nothing Burger but um there's there's just not enough capital in crypto to pre-hedge a having event right think of the amount of dollars it would take to buy Bitcoin up to the net present value of Bitcoin where the amount of minor selling is halved into perpetuity it's just that amount of capital doesn't exist the amount of capital that could flow into Bitcoin seamlessly with a BlackRock ETF like there isn't that amount of capital in Bitcoin right now so you you can't like the market can't trade to where it should go after all of that buying has taken place so I think crypto being a small Market relatively speaking of course still a mega cap asset but a small Market makes it easier to sort of trade ahead of these events that would normally chop you up in tradfi yeah I I I'd agree with that I I also and this is just reflected across the Spectrum uh in crypto so there are a couple things that happen that happened in the last week that just reminded me how Slow the market is to react to things in crypto one is that gbtc didn't have its crazy move until the Monday after the BlackRock filing was announced even though it was I think there was a reason for that there was a which was a big reason for that basically you know you you could make the argument that I made earlier about how gbtc could trade down quite a lot if they acted their own best interest but what really sent gbtc soaring was the rumor unsubstantiated thus far but on crypto news sites and crypto Twitter that uh Fidelity was gonna buy grayscale or looking to buy grayscale do you you think that you think that was a real I think it was just yeah that hit the tape and it just it ripped I think it was a little bit a little bit of both I think it was people reacting slow and then coming in over the learning about it over the weekend and then coming in on Monday and making and making their bets the other thing that's interesting is that is that the uh miners have been so I talked about this to uh I think two podcasts ago at this point of how bullish I was on miners for two reasons one was a transaction fees to where the pivot to AI that were coming by the way like every Miner is now pivoting to Ai and people just didn't seem to appreciate this Hut 8 was a great example they signed a contract to provide HBC on June 14th and then two days later proceeded to Rocket this was actually pre-bitcoin rocketing so it's like people just aren't paying attention to the sector at all uh irises are pivoting to AI they just have a lot of chips and they're gonna rent them out to people who want to train models with them or well yes uh but it's not about the chips because it's a completely different business uh you need specific a specific type of Chip uh and it's more about the facilities and the access to people that know how to for example cooling is important in both Bitcoin mining and HBC they have all of that set up they have the people that know how to how to build out those Services they have the warehouses and the facilities they have the power contracts right and so the actual product is radically different and requires a decent amount of upfront investment but the overall operations are very similar and so a lot of these miners like hot 8 like iron like Cipher are going out there and they're saying hey guys well we're just going to repurpose some of our facilities to go provide HBC because it seems like there's a tremendous amount of demand diversifying the business generating more Revenue uh and Hut I mean since I mentioned it is up a ton right and it's like okay well that's kind of interesting because people reacted very slowly even though all the information was public all of it was out there all of it was for the taking it's just that nobody nobody from tradfi was really looking at the sector let's work through the mechanics of this a little bit more for the listeners um and I'm gonna pretend it's just for the listeners and not for me even though I'm curious too um okay so a minor pivots to AI what does that mean exactly let's walk through the sequence of events they start using some of their people and facilities and Hardware to that's a key not Hardware because the hardware doesn't transfer a6. like you can't provide HBC with A6 because A6 again application specific okay so no Hardware it's in the name what does that do for hash rate what does that do for minor selling why would that mean this Miner selling it doesn't mean less minor selling I just think that it's good for the miners okay I see so you're talking about a trade for minor stocks you're not saying hey oh yeah resources are going to get diverted away from core activity and there's a stock underwear I just think Bitcoin I just I I have I don't think it has any any impact on bitcoin price other than it actually well it's inequities may it may have an impact on bitcoin price and that it makes mining companies healthier right if you have diver you you have less of this potential for selling on the way down in the future that's actually I I hadn't actually considered this until you ask this question but it's possible that miners just don't like moving forward miners will get liquidated less often as they become better and more robust businesses it would make the market healthier for sure and it would also say it would also tell the world like hey look crypto has provided a series of infrastructure plays that are relevant outside of just crypto like it to me I think there are a few examples of that in crypto and and minors being a new one would be would be good for the space frankly as opposed to just this energy you know it basically says like there is a market for you know energy consuming compute you know specific like purpose specific computation facilities outside of just one out application and that one application sort of laid the the rails for other applications I think that that would be a healthy narrative frankly I think so yeah I think I think that's a reasonable that's a reasonable outtake um yeah but it's just you know these these types of things seem to uh just take a while I think the main point is that these uh especially the these Trad five based narratives seem to take a while to really percolate uh in a way that I mean crypto seems to move very quickly because there are a lot of people watching crypto but in Trad fire it takes a while to percolate um Jonas like their opportunities for crypto focused investors to trade the Trad Phi linked assets like these trusts grayscale maybe BlackRock mining stocks coinbase stock all sorts of opportunity out there in order to get it right but you know I think that is a pretty substantial source of alpha so uh yeah um I think we've had a really good discussion today likewise always great appreciate up with you I appreciate Bitcoin deciding to rip through 30 on the it's still suscending it's I know it's still it's still it's still sending what a move it's what what a good what a good day a good day I mean we're all pretty feeling pretty dejected a couple weeks ago now everybody's euphoric again I know I hate it I I like I like feeling happy when everybody else is dejected and I can start buying and then I get really nervous and everybody gets euphoric so anyway we'll see how this goes good luck out there everybody this is uh this is not

all we're doing is we're telling stories for the future why AI is going to be a bigger bubble than crypto is it's so easy you just log into chat GPT and you do a poem to your mother and do it in the voice of Walt Whitman and you're like oh my God you're such a good poet uh everyone can understand what AI might do and so of course you've gotten a video already at crazy price doesn't mean you can't double right bubbles don't normally last three months they just don't [Music] we are thrilled to have everybody back for another episode of a thousand X podcast today we've got one of the Larger than Life figures in in crypto today Mike novogratz is joining us uh you know I'm super psyched I think we're gonna have a we're gonna have a great conversation and just ready to ready to dive in I mean like I've I've known you for for a bit and I've always been kind of fascinated by your by your background here um you've had a pretty diverse one you were Prince and wrestler military helicopter pilot you've mentioned running marathons into Sahara and even doing a little bit of Ayahuasca what experiences do you think contributed the most to your success in your career in a wrestling uh uh teaches you how to lose and come back you know teach you tenacity it teaches you toughness uh there's a great quote once you've wrestled uh everything else everything else in life is easy and so I mean I was a good wrestler I wasn't a great wrestler but but it defined who I was until I was 22. um and so I think that's where the foundation comes from um I also got lucky in that I pivoted my way into something that I was naturally good at if you think about what macro investing is It's a combination of reading economic Trends political trends social social trends and understanding how markets behave with with those inputs there's a lot of intuition in it right it's it's very different than some businesses uh there's Hustle but mostly intuition and I stumbled into it because you know it's a storyteller's business right you you look at the world you create a story you then put your positions on and you tell that story uh and I was kind of a natural-born Storyteller and so macro came really natural to me I didn't know that I when I was a Salesman at Goldman Sachs I thought I was just cute and Charming uh and uh people like to deal with because I was fun it wasn't until I left being a Salesman and left being a Trader Goldman when I was doing a hedge fund I realized oh [ __ ] they talked to me because I was right most of the time you know that my ability to either know who was going to be right and steal that info or that story uh or synthesize the information was was right more than it was wrong um and so that's a lot of luck to stumble in a career like to to figure out what you're good at you mentioned a couple of points in there that we sort of wanted to drill in on with you um macro investing it's notoriously difficult it's you know the number of variables that go into the equation whose output is the price of some macro asset like Bitcoin or crude oil it's vast it's immense so you know obviously they're synthesizing the information maybe you hear about the right thing from somebody else but I think listeners would really appreciate learning from you directly uh do you have a process for synthesizing these macro trades before you go and and tell the tell the story yeah I do I do it's it's not linear right so I think what's important for everyone is to figure out what information they need to make a decision process that information so in macro there's tons of data points from country visits to charts to to you know surveys to fundamentals and so I'm talking to people and all kinds of different areas of expertise so when I used to trade Emerging Markets I would go to a country and I would meet the bankers and I would meet corporates and I would be the investors and I'd Meet the Press uh and pretty soon I'm at the Central Bank in the Ministry of Finance pretty soon I would understand Indonesia um you know I used to tell people when I was trading dollar Yen if I had the newspaper for the end of the year and you had the newspaper at the end of the year uh both in the U.S and and in Japan we still might make different bets on where dollar yen is going to be and we might not be right right there's and so you take all this data and you put it through your algorithm mine is pattern recognition right I look at the chart and it tells me something it's fundamental analysis political analysis it's all those analysis at the bottom it's a guess it's an I think I think and because you're guessing you're scared all the time but if I'm wrong oh [ __ ] and so the real trick is can you develop a discipline uh and this is where wrestling or other disciplines come into play where you create a set of rules that you manage your risk by and manage your life by quite Frank that allows you the best chance of having your guesses be in your portfolio so that's often stop losses or sizing or some philosophy right what most macro traders in crypto missed last year and the year before it's like they're like oh go straight up and then you know they made a ton of money and they lost 75 percent on average uh they don't realize when you lose 75 you're pretty much out of business right it takes five and a half up 25 years to come back to zero like no one's got the patience to wait five and a half years and 25 is a good year right uh and so people didn't have an understanding of risk and volatility and stop losses and and quite frankly even year end right you're running a hedge fund and you're going to year round and you're up 80 percent on gen 1 you're up zero so you can be using you can be playing with The house's money and The house's money is your money starting gen one right you've taken your 20 promote now your investors uh don't expect you to have a huge drawdown and so all of those lessons you know can be put into three buckets what information do you need how do you process it and then what are the rules that give you the best chance of staying alive and having your portfolio match your views so I always tell traders to carry three notebooks and and you get better in each of those notebooks yeah that makes that makes a ton of sense I mean from a from a crypto perspective crypto markets are intensely short-term and then also intensely long term in many ways you need this you know 5 10 20 year outlook to stay convicted in the asset class but there's so many things that happen on a day-to-day basis on a week-to-week basis that change price pretty pretty immensely so when you're thinking about how you used to trade in the in the macro markets and you know what the types of assets it used to trade before and how you how you approach how you approach crypto today what what are what are some what are some differences and similarities between those who asked classes crypto last year was an 80 Vol asset and I never traded an 80 ball ad Theory report was 100 cool assets and so if you were going to have a 10 million dollar fund and run it 90 long you're pretty much just going to a casino and flipping coins like the the chance of having a volatility adjusted return or sharp ratio uh well ludicrous unless you just got lucky when I went straight up um and so the biggest lesson are the biggest transition you need to make is sizing and expectations right most crypto funds had too much risk in it now that was really fun when you bought something at one it went to 400. but to do it one to 400 happens once in a lifetime and we were having having it happen all the time and so the just knowledge that this was bubbles it was a bubble caused by a beautiful idea it was bubble caused by a set of circumstances of zero interest rates and people at home and young people went into Gamble that having had that experience encouraged me to take chips off the table sometimes too early but to be constantly a chip taker um and some of my younger friends who hadn't gone through Cycles uh it didn't really understand bubbles would take a little bit of chips off and get right back in you know and so I think experience had some you know some Merit uh in the last both in the 17 cycle and the 21 cycle um but real reality even on a go forward basis it's all sizing um right crypto's up even after today's sell-off 55 on the year single best asset other than Nvidia uh but is it really well if you've all adjusted it's still up it's still got a high sharp ratio but it's not as good as say apple uh this year uh it was you know I was having a correction um and so you've got to be careful it doesn't mean you can't take a lot of risk you need to take a lot of risks in bursts and you know right now volatilities seems very low and mispriced and so shifting some of your cast position and options make sense to me um but it's all those tools that you learn over time that you need to survive but the biggest lesson is you know understand volatility if stocks traded 20 volatility and currencies at 10 in crypto at 50 or 60 you're for the same conviction your position sizes should be very different the other mistake people make is well I'm a crypto guy just you're you're a it's an asset you're a Trader it's got unique characteristics but so does crude oil and so does natural gas and so does corn and so do interest rates and so do currencies and so this idea of crypto as its own asset class or I'm a crypto Trader uh that was misplaced for most fund managers it wasn't misplaced for the engineers it wasn't misplaced for the revolutionaries in the space but if you're a fund manager it was misplaced managing portfolios is the same no matter what you manage so you mentioned something interesting in there you you know you mentioned the fundamentals of risk taking and understanding volatility um you're you're known as being one of the Risk Takers not just in crypto but in macro more broadly what specific characteristics does crypto have that help you um remain so convicted in the space even during drawdowns like what what framework do you cling to when things are looking a little shaky so we're in the zone still where we're selling a vision of the future and what made crypto unique is let's separate it right Bitcoin came at a time right when people were losing trust in the in the in the centralized infrastructure governments Banks but also at a time when populism was creeping its way into every government right if you look at debt to GDP in the U.S it's skyrocketed since 08 right so that's debt to GDP is a pretty good proxy for populism I want to spend money because it feels good and I remember Trump said when he had the single greatest increase in government spending ever and that was before covet someone said who's going to pay for it he said someone else's gonna worry about that uh right he had the single greatest increase in government spending and he had tax cuts right because it felt good and so that story is not going away right we just had a we just had a um budget I mean a debt ceiling Showdown and you know McCarthy's declaring Victory Biden's declaring victory uh they did cap spending for two years on non-defense um but they capped it at a level that was close to 24 of GDP When government spending normally is closer to twenty percent of GDP so it's like me giving you triple allowance for two years as a young kid and then saying I'm gonna get tough you know this year I'm only giving you a triple allowance again [Laughter] you know we're spending more than we can is the narrative for why Bitcoin or other hard assets will appreciate over time and so I don't think we can get out of that story for the next 10 years 15 years and so I'm a really structural bullish on hard assets um they're going to be big cyclical moves right when rates were zero of course a Bitcoin should have gone to 65 000 when Powell decided to raise them really fast and try to stop the runaway train of inflation because supposed to come back down um and so I do think you've got to have a you're going to have an economic cycle within that big secular Trend uh in an adoption cycle uh we thought institutions were going to buy crypto I've got 430 people a Galaxy all geared up to help institutions come in to buy crypto and a combination of bad behavior with a lot of our peers uh uh you know Sam back and freed and and co uh tough regulation or bad regulation or no regulation out of the U.S and five percent interest rates and that enthusiasm has waned now the only Silver Lining is retail's still mine it was always the people's Revolution and they're still out there and so I haven't given up Faith certainly in Bitcoin um the other parts of crypto right this big decentralized revolution what will be built on ethereum and this base layer of trust that we can build this whole new World on is happening but the market now seems to want to see [ __ ] that works I I don't have an app yet right if we lived in in Africa or the Mideast we would probably use crypto for payments but here we probably use Apple pay right works um and so unless you're an early adopter you're not using web 3 in your normal life and I think doesn't mean we can't have markets go higher because there's a trillion dollars in the crypto space that cares about it but I think to suck people in to get them really excited again especially with the competition AI we're going to need some apps that people can get their teeth you know teeth into in their mind around and because even with that all we're doing is we're telling stories for the future why AI is going to be a bigger bubble than crypto is it's so easy you just log in and chat GPT and you do a poem to your mother and do it in the voice of Walt Whitman oh my God you're such a good poet uh everyone can understand what AI might do and so of course you've gotten a video already at crazy price doesn't mean you can't double right bubbles don't normally last three months they just don't they normally last a couple years uh and so I don't know if the video goes straight up but I would tell you I don't think we've seen the high uh of that whole AI bubble and so crypto is going to compete with that we can come up with why crypto's imported it could be really important right authentication right with all these deep fakes and how do I validate that this is actually my work or you know my um but now I want to see people actually show me the app that does it and even if it doesn't get complete adoption then we're telling stories that people can get their you know sink their teeth into again yeah I think I think that's that's one of the tough I was actually just talking about this uh with with my partner my partner Joe later today it's we're we're in the we're in the show me stage my opinion it's the you know it's without without something that brings in a ton of people uh that's as easy to use as as chat GPT you kind of get stuck and I think Bitcoin obviously has that narrative already built in the store value narrative the hard asset narrative the rest of crypto less so but that's also you know what we're constantly looking for uh in in the market right looking for what are what are the most what are the most promising opportunities in the crypto space right now I mean for people like us if we're investing long term that's that's where we that's where we look so I'm curious for you when you think about the crypto Market in aggregate so you know we have your view we have your view on bitcoin outside of that where do you find the most interesting opportunities is it in short-term trading is it in you know long-term investing in protocols investing in applications I mean where where are you finding the most opportunity right now we keep Bitcoin and ethereum with kind of core um I like the the supply demand the you know setup for ethereum right there's not a whole lot of Supply um I have less and we're still putting small amounts of venture out but I think people got too long venture over the last cycle and that's going to take time to digest through uh our lending business it's an interesting business because a lot of the lenders got out of the market right Genesis block five Voyager Celsius and so uh that's a more conservative way of staying in the game um but it's it's it's certainly less alty than it was was in the past um and my expectation is this is going to be more lackadaisical for a while I got my eye on gaming still because gaming is so tangential to crypto and while there haven't been a lot of web 3 games that have taken off yet there are a couple that are starting to get a little bit of traction uh mythicals got uh an NBA you know uh Smash Up game that is is starting to get a little bit of traction um that makes too much intuitive sense that web 3 in gaming and gaming is just in a 25-year bull market right young kids love to game and so we have a fund that invests in gaming with some web three but when they underwrite their underwriting game studios they're not really underwriting and the the web 3 is is often the the cherry on top um and so that's kind of it again there's some specific Investments our guys will make uh because they think there's unique teams and uh you want to be still in the game if we if we run it back uh run it back to your points earlier talking about Bitcoin specifically and and how we've been trading with the with with the broader markets and how you sort of think about Bitcoin is this as this hedge against irresponsible government uh spending or irresponsible government actions I mean this year we've had you know we've we've had a lot of different events and a lot of different regimes in the in in the crypto markets right so at the beginning of the year you had Bitcoin correlating very heavily with with risk Market to protect then after svb it was more much more correlated with gold uh than anything else and now it seems to be almost doing its own thing or you have cues ripping in a pretty narrow rally but Bitcoin just refusing refusing to follow and so when you think about what's happening there and who's participating I think we're not going to get a sustained Bitcoin rally until the Fed the FED we're done and that in my mind is probably in the summer we've all been a little bit to too pessimistic um on the economy I think we're gonna go back but history is Rewritten the four trillion dollars of you know covid stimulus was really an experiment in Universal basic income it's lasted longer than people thought and people spend money and they like their new lifestyle and so we've had a service economy that continues to be vibrant where the industrial economy has been slowing and slowing and so as a macro guy you're sure you're you're used to you know ISM surveys all these things rolling over you're like of course unemployment is going to follow and it hasn't um you know we have banking crises looked like that was the end and all of a sudden they government gives more money to all the banks um and you know we just had a big strong jobs report I think it's getting more Hollow and I think the economy will slow and so I think uh matter of fact I did today I bought some 30 ether and Bitcoin calls um I think that's probably you know end of summer you get the Fed either having started to cut or at least saying we're worried about the economy and you know either going to cut and that's probably the next thing that gets Bitcoin need higher do you think we ever go back to two percent inflation I I personally don't I think they're going to revise that Target higher to allow for the the cycle you just described to continue of people uh post covet basically um that's a great question I think they're gonna talk two percent and hope for three percent look at if if you think about when I graduated from college debt to GDP was about 50 percent it's about 130 now 125 percent um you guys can check me on my facts uh the only way out of that is inflating your debt away and so like last year they did a pretty good job right we had seven percent inflation you know we're paying three percent for our debt two and a half percent that was the kind of Blended average so you just inflated four percent of the Dead away you need to do that for a while um and if you can't say that as a central banker and you can't say that as a treasury official uh but you want to have higher inflation uh to get out of the debt trap um if it gets too high you're screwed and so it's a really really challenging dance for the stewards of your economy to pull off um and so it it's something to watch listen there are structural reasons why inflation will be more stubborn but in a lot of ways it says we had 30 years of globalization where the wealthy we're getting a bigger bigger share and workers weren't and how workers are fighting backlit wages are going higher uh they're not enough of them uh we're going to rebuild Supply chains because of the ridiculous War we have with China um and so I think there would be some structural reasons why inflation is stickier and so you might be right but I don't think they're going to reset their target okay that's that's a good framework for thinking about this this next question which is um is Bitcoin you know big we all know that bitcoin's a debasement hedge if you know monetary and fiscal policy are too profligate Bitcoin performs but you know obviously we saw that it isn't necessarily the best inflation hedge last year so do you see prolonged inflation as a form of debasement which leads to bitcoin performance or how do you how do you think about the relationship between alternate monitor monetary systems like crypto and policy yeah as as as Fiat currencies get debased hard assets should go higher remember we had a speculative frenzy around Biko because it was a spectacular inflation hedge if you bought at the beginning covered you bought it at seven thousand it went to sixty nine thousand ten extra money there was no better inflation hedge in the world than Bitcoin or other crypto during covet when we were all panicked about inflation when inflation finally showed if Powell had you know strapped up and become a real Central Banker uh and you know he took a sledgehammer to the to the gonads of uh of inflation right that was painful uh crypto would have kept going higher um and so I I think it's unfair to say it wasn't a good inflation there was a lot of inflation last year but there was a century fighting it and so markets always get ahead of where they're supposed to be and so um I think again it it'll trade semi-correlated with gold and semi-correlated with risk and I say that because it's a new asset and so if you're really in a oh [ __ ] I'm losing everything I want to pay down leverage I'm not sure I have the courage to buy new assets right that's why the adoption curve happens it's why young people get more comfortable with it than old people because old people have never you know they have their own safe assets um and so the only thing I see promising right now in the midst of you know regulatory assault and and very little sponsorship from institutions is retail continues to accumulate through the you know we cover the platforms like a b to B to C Blair and it's surprising to me how much buying happens every day in small amounts that adds up to big amounts um and so I don't think if we get an s p that just gets the hell knocked out of it uh if there's a Fed response of much lower rate so if it's not stagflation I think Bitcoin could do okay but if it's a stagflation I think Bitcoin will struggle for a while by the way I think I think we are fighting each other on those calls today lifting lifting some as well actually from you guys so thank you thank you for that let's open this thing alike yeah exactly exactly I mean if vol's just come in so much trading sub 40 on eth so here here's the risk on ball yeah is that listen we talked to how many between Miners and hedge funds and private equity and protocols right over a hundred crypto institutions and Banking and most of them aren't rolling in doubt most of them have made Cuts already and have an operating budget that was made for a different era and and so selling calls went from being a hedge to be an income generator that's very dangerous right and you've been paid to sell calls right and so after that first rally selling anything is you look smart and so what what happens often is people get addicted to that income and so while crypto Vol seems crazy cheap I told my guys don't spend all your money yet it could get cheaper and it will get cheaper and cheaper until suddenly shifts and then everyone who's got short is going to get their face ripped off but that's the painful cycle of markets and so I was trying to have a a lottery on how low crypto you know both Ethan and Bitcoin Vols will go and when we go sub 30. because 30 is about as high as you get in normal assets it would be the first time doesn't get into that and so I I don't know I don't have a magic wand on that but I do know um it wouldn't surprise me if it went lower yeah that makes sense I think it comes back to what you said what you said about sizing because every time every time you lose on that trade it is likely a better trade at the end of that right so if if you lift if you lift some calls in in a month you haven't went to that then you're probably looking at sub 30. so you just size it to be able to get in there right yeah uh which which makes which makes a ton of sense I'm I'm kind of curious you said something there about uh you know in institutions being a lot more reluctant than retail to get to get into the market and and Retail being being the driving force maybe maybe a two-part question what do you think what do you think people are missing about why retail uh you know is buying and what do you think what could really increase that increase that rate of adoption is it and you know is it going to come from inside the us outside the US I mean I think outside listen we just have Hong Kong uh Hong Kong allow retail to buy through regulated exchanges you know they can't use stable coins so there's going to be a little bit of a educational and onboarding you know uh delay but that's important I I think Asia continues to be uh a place where people like to gamble and people understand crypto and so um that won't surprise me to see Asia continue to be imported um but I think retail is this kind of slow grindy you know we need new storytellers right it doesn't help that CZ gets indicted by the SEC or that like our our storytellers are our promoters are explainers are important parts of the ecosystem I keep teasing that I've done my share and someone else has to actually start going on CNBC and you know tell the crypto story um but what Bitcoin and all these ecosystems are are social constructs between people right the genus isn't in the the technology we could recreate it and call it a hobby coin and it would be really hard for you to get 140 million people to want to store their hard-earned Savings in the Avi coin blockchain right so Bitcoin has this giant head start but you need to bring people explain it to them have them understand it so they're willing to trust their savings um Bitcoin is just a store of value in lots of ways so that's the that's all that there is it's the social construct it's a miracle that we created a brand in 12 or 13 years with a 400 billion dollar market cap or whatever the market cap is owned by 150 million people it's the seventh or eighth largest country in the world like Bitcoin Nation that's a freaking miracle and lots of people deserve a lot of credit for it uh each of the crypto ecosystems need that in some ways we can't have 400 right uh uh Ava's done an amazing job they have a different story a different use case but until more and more of the worlds run on block space the storytelling piece is important right italic is wildly important even though he owns less than one percent of all the ethereum right as a symbolic hat who's been a good guy who hasn't then they you know like if there's one hero of the space it's probably vitalik um he's wildly important Joe Lubin was important that ethereum ecosystem all the Investments he did building up the ecosystem built the building senses uh but they need more in each of these and one of the things we were having now is when you see yesterday's Heroes become Scoundrels um it's not good and so you need to see some new some new storytellers some new ideas emerge to get the animal spirits going again to draw people back into our systems that is that is an interesting point you bring up that storytelling leads to demand for crypto's product which is block space and if you look on the ethereum network um you know block space has been In Demand right if there's a neutral level which is 16 GUI above which it's deflationary below which it's inflationary been averaging you know 50 to 100 guav for a long time so clearly people want this stuff and the fundamentals look strong but like you said it's hard to fight the flows for people coming in selling calls every day well what's so interesting is when I I was talking to one of my friends you guys probably can figure his who runs a big you know ethereum ecosystem company um that's mostly on chain and it doesn't feel one-third is bad there than it does in any of the you know the C5 defined companies companies like ours because there's that vibrancy that you're talking about that's happening you know if it's people using metamask growth or you know that that original organic crypto peer-to-peer world is still growing last time I looked at blockspace last year it was dominated by nfts it opensc was literally eating all the block space uh nfts were an amazing vehicle for us to tell stories and explain to people that one of satoshi's geniuses was not just Bitcoin but it was the first private property in the digital space the first private property on the internet right there was no capitalism without private property there's no freedom without private property and Satoshi gave us that in the best way for the masses to understand that was the nft and so when nfts came they exploded uh because it was understandable right you can pull people in it was nft NBA Top Shot or candy or punks or I'm looking we've got 10 punks hanging in our office uh we have our own Galaxy nfts that that of course you know those prices got crazy like people at 69 million dollars might have been the greatest short in history and I love people um but the concept was wildly important uh and that's not going to go away you know again you need now you need nfts that are are gamified nfts that are part of broader ecosystems that can connect customers to their to to their brands like loyalty points that that become not just commemorative tickets but real tickets and so all that infrastructure is being worked on and built once one of those things takes off again you'll hear about it and you'll start to see in the next uh it makes total sense so you you know you obviously understand storytelling you're fantastic at it and you you know how to pick out a good story before it necessarily becomes popular and goes viral that's probably if I had to guess something behind your original investment in Bitcoin so why is it you know Avi and I both wanted to know this why is it that you decided to create you know a diversified Financial crypto services company this time as opposed to the previous Venture which is a great question yeah another way of asking it why not just go long uh long Bitcoin and walk away you know what I was just on the phone with a friend of mine who did that we went in together and I was like man oh man there are days I wake up and wish I just did what you did because it would have been so much easier listen I was 50 well that's on 59 58 now it was five years ago I was young 50s um and I figured I had one more chapter in life at least and I love working the young people I never really been a venture investor and and that excited me and I thought I had a role to play at helping people come into the ecosystem and that a platform like Galaxy was was the right thing to do um now truth be told I am really good at a few things and not as good at others uh and so I've you know hired people to work alongside of me some have been great hires others have come and gone but we're putting together a team of people that have varied skill sets to be able to certainly fill in where I'm not good but bring their own talents to bear um it's hard right it would have been a lot easier to be a an investor or even an asset manager because the asset management cost structure is just so much smaller when you're building infrastructure for the space um so you guys can trade and other people can trade with us and that's that's that's expensive um and so you know now I look back I'm like was I crazy I did it because I thought I had a role to play is the answer and that I thought it would be a New Journey um it wasn't necessarily as well thought out as a trade as I would have made it was just a trade yeah that makes sense leave it leave it leave an impact on crypto I think is you know it's a good it's a good good and Noble good good and Noble thing to do I want to um I want to ask you about uh just reflecting uh reflecting on your career as as a Trader will discount Galaxy because he said it's less well filled out than a trade I mean what was your what was your favorite trade over your career that stands out to you well when Asia blew up in 1997. that's what I went from a guy who made 25 million book and we worked 21 hours days literally for that whole 1997. I used to call him you know one year was a dog year um and it was by far the most memorable year because I went from boy to man it's a traitor uh or at least boy to young adult um what you also learn is you make these discreet jumps you're nervous around betting five hundred thousand dollars and then five million dollars it's not linear it it it's discreet and I was able to bet a small amount of money and make a fortune in Thailand because I bet on the interest rate curve uh forward points in foreign exchange and very few people were focused on that and that allowed me to feel like a I could take more risk and so I made that jump at Goldman Sachs for me attending on a 10 guy to a hundred dollar guy hard to do some people in crypto made it quickly but then they they unmade it uh the great thing about Goldman is once you made the money the the partner's like thank you and I take it from you it's not yours and you start the next year with with bigger courage but starting at zero again so there wasn't this make it all lose it all uh it wasn't allowed the Lloyd blank line was a fiercely good risk manager uh even if he didn't talk to you every day every week every month uh when he smelled the money going he was on the phone uh and so I think that was probably the most memorable listen buying ethereum at one uh was both I mean it's a wonderful story it was both Lucky it was it was who you know in your network I knew Joe Lubin I would have never been engaged in ethereum if it wasn't for him I had met vitalik before that um and so that's probably still you know one one to four thousand that very few people you know to get a one to a hundred is a pretty impressive trade you get a one to four thousand uh that's a once in a lifetime I mean that's a that's a that's a venture-like return and not just any like you said any Venture type return that's a Google or a Facebook or even more um and I think what protects a lot of venture capitalists from themselves is the fact that you know seed stage private Equity just isn't liquid so when you're watching when you're long ethereum and you paid one dollar for your tokens and you're watching it trading at 200 400 600 how do you restrain yourself from so I tell you a funny story I spoke at the first ethereal and it was out in Brooklyn and you know Louboutin put it together and there was I don't know 400 people in an auditorium and I asked they were all the guys who built ethereum and worked around it I was like well who who's ever owned ethereum and about two-thirds of the hands went up and I was like well who still owns it in about 90 went down and it was trading about seventy dollars I was telling them of a thing that Paul Jones Paul Tudor Jones a great Trader used to call the pain of the game it's harder to ride a tread but great fortunes are made in trend um and so you got to handcuff yourself to the chair I usually leave that metaphor you literally got to handcuff yourself to the chair it's easier to stop out than it is to let winners run and by my end of my speech that's how small the Mark was ethereum had gotten 80 85 90 9500 the next day it's 1 30. I'm selling it handcuff yourself over there and I couldn't do it and so I was lucky enough that I bought enough um that I could sell a little bit you know and and think of it like when something explodes like that I thought of it like an option almost like I was trading positive gamma um you know at one point I had a thing called the lock box I was like well no matter what we're never getting into the lock box of ethereum and I tell you what if I was smart enough I would have had it in a smart contract I wasn't smart enough sure enough I broke the lock box when it went higher um and so listen if I had kept all my ethereum that I bought that first day right today it would be worth two billion dollars and let me tell you I've I made a lot of money on ethereum but my ethereum does not worth two billion dollars and so uh I get a lot of credit I give a lot of credit to myself for holding as long as I did it was made easier by the fact that I was already rich right I had made a billion dollars before I got into crypto in macro and in Fortress and other stuff uh and so my original size was bigger than most people's uh and that made me more money in crypto and my ability to not completely freak out um listen I in I don't want to Discount the credit me and my team gets on I remember in 17 I'd get in these icos and they'd be up a ton and I'd be selling it and some of the crypto guys were like ah dude we can't sell this a great protocol and I'll be like did you not hear me it's my money and you worked for me and I said sell it and they still wouldn't sell so I'd have to literally get another guy under the seat and say please sell my goddamn tokens um you know it's hard for people and for me that was easier because they you know tokens I didn't even know what they did were going up 30 40 and 17. and so we had an ethos of taking profit in crypto I just didn't believe there could be that many Googles like you know and I thought Bitcoin and ethereum had such a head start on developing the network effect in the community that they were going to be my core Holdings and everything else if it's if it's polka dot or luna or uh you name it I was a seller along the way also helps you avoid avoid blow-ups a ton in this space right that that constant taking taking chips off the table I mean I think in in 21 especially one of the hardest things that I rented is like when when is the trend over right I think a lot of people want to buy the Pico bottom and sell the picotop and then Pat themselves on the back and tell themselves that they're they're they're they're great it should have been easier you knew year-end people were gonna try to ramp it into year-end and so like year end was that it was you knew the Fed was going to start raising like I wasn't you didn't know what month but they were going to start raising you had had an unbelievable run and the leader had already come off and secondary things were going higher right I mean Bitcoin was way off and Luna kept going up and so we we get credit we sold I don't know this is probably public but over a billion dollars of stuff uh but I tell you what I had another billion I could have sold and it's hard it's hard you know you talk about a public company and what you should keep because the shareholders want you can make a thousand excuses not to do the hard thing the hard thing was like go to the sideline and that's where Avi to be honest if it was me in a family office it would have been easier right uh yeah you're not as public you know uh in 17 I did mostly that and everything every once while I would tell you I guess I was like dude dude you made so much money just just sell it all rent a boat go away for a month and come back and it's you know it's hard for people to let go that adrenaline of of you know it's not just greed it's it's you get committed to this cause so you mentioned greed and cause uh we know you're a very charitable guy as we as we run out of time here um you know all of this all of this you know Capital that you generate from you know your discipline and your process how do you like to reinvest it in the uh in the broader world of people who need it you know I think you need to spend some on yourself in your own Community your community when I say that your family your friends you know the people that you're you surround yourself with because you know money is energy and it's you should share some of that good energy um and then you should look at you know how you can make an impact uh I've shifted my philanthropic focus a few times I was a wrestler so a lot of what started around Youth Sports and how that can build leaders and so I started to think I'll beat the streets or certainly helped accelerate Beat the Streets um I then got into Criminal Justice Reform well that probably should have been thrown in jail for some of the [ __ ] I did as a teenager uh I didn't really have a link to it until I started meeting people and realized just what an unfair and stupid and uneconomic and immoral system we have and so I got engaged with that um democracy reform the more you give the more you get it sounds cliche stories I'm I've been told and learned and the places I've been uh the richness of my life at least half of it comes from those philanthropic experiences um and so it's not that you're like a saint you know there's a selfishness to giving it's it's you're learning you're uncovering you're connecting and so that's why I encourage people to to give um it opens up new communities right and so come to mind my parties and uh they don't look like everyone else's parties you know we've got young and old black and white you know every color in between and um income groups all over the place uh and that's kind of what I love to do trying to create that Community that's not normally seen as a community I appreciate that Mike and thank you thank you for spending the time to talk with us for an hour had a great conversation maybe maybe the next one I'll tell the story of you steamrolling me in wrestling man we'll say we'll save that one for the next time all right guys thank you Mike foreign [Music]

moved back to Chicago in '94 and I said you know if this stuff if the CME hasn't completely transitioned to the screen by the year 2000 this place is going to be out of business and and I just couldn't have been more wrong um I I couldn't have been more wrong about the timing it took far longer than that um I think these transitions always do [Music] thank you guys for joining in for another episode of the THX podcast we welcome you back and this time we have a very special guest who has not done a lot of podcasting before uh and we are very lucky to have him on this time actually is the Hefe of Jonah my partner in crime on this podcast we have uh Don Wilson the founder of drw joining us and I'll let Jonah who knows him much better than I do courtesy of working together give the intro thanks Ai and and thanks Don for for joining us sure we've got a lot of really interesting interesting content to put out today um Don uh graduated from the University of Chicago and went straight into trading uh you know right into the the pit in Chicago and in 1992 founded drw which is a global trading firm uh which which touches pretty much every every asset class uh both prop trading and and you know liquidity provision so pretty exciting company uh at the intersection of trading and technology so don thank you very much for joining us without further Ado can you tell us what it was that Drew you to trading straight out of college how you just knew that you wanted to uh to make that your career the foundational stuff yeah so so when I when I came to college I um had no idea what I wanted to do but I knew that I was good at math and I knew that I liked using math to solve problems and my initial inclination was you know maybe I'd do something in science and um as I kind of experienced college and the academic setting a little bit I was a little bit concerned about um about the very slow feedback loop that H happens in Academia and um I actually I I raced sailboats in high school and in college and um one of the guys that I raced with was working on his post doctor in uh in physics um he actually went on to to fly the space shuttle but at the time he um you know in addition to working on his post dooc he would he was fiddling around with with uh FX modeling and I was like you know that's really cool like you get this immediate feedback loop and you don't have to like write a paper about it and present it and kind of not really know if you're right or wrong um you just figure something out and then go see if it works and and you find out right away uh that sounds like a lot of fun and so that's when I decided that I wanted to go into trading and obviously being in Chicago the trading pits were right there what what was it like uh when you first when you first stepped into the uh stepped into the pit I mean what what's actually the process that you went through of getting up to speed and and figuring out how to trade I mean I can imagine that you walk in there and it's hectic and it's crazy I mean how'd you how'd you figure it all out what what you what did you start with yeah so so it was um so what I did was and and you know I graduated early so I graduated when I was 20 um and and I was um an extreme introvert had a real hard time interacting with people and uh but I got a job with a small trading firm called letco and they said okay um you're going to we'll have you spend a couple weeks standing next to different traders that work for us and then after 6 months they said okay uh uh here's $100,000 uh good luck and I uh became a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange leased a seat and decided to go in the Euro doll option pit which is uh three-month lior options and you know at that point you walk into the pit the pit opens at 7:20 in the morning it's open from 7:20 to 2: and um you you know find a spot to stand and uh um it's pretty intimidating cuz there's I mean it's super crowded a bunch of people pushing and shoving yelling and screaming it looks like total chaos um but the reality of it is is it's just math um and so I'd stand in the pit during the day and then go home and uh write code build option pricing models write risk software um fiddle around with different volatility you know kind of trying to model volatility surfaces and um and then go back the next day and and uh see if any of it worked um and and after uh you know after a little while um I I started to figure some things out and um you know the the whole my whole uh mindset was how do I how do I Define the fair value of every single option on the you know across the whole surface and um and then how do I then use that framework to and the order flow coming into the pit to pick up small amounts of positive expected value um and uh yeah so that's that's how it all started so what's an example of something that you went home and coded and brought back into the pit the next day that just kind of worked yeah so so you know there were a few um a few iterations that were helpful uh I mean first of all you know I had some stuff that was I think not all that Innovative but but you know I designed my own my own sheets with all my own option values on them I actually used an image writer 2 to print them so they took hours to print I lived in a studio apartment so I had to put like a pillow on top of the printer when I went to bed um not sure all that stuff was that you know was that amazing but it was nice to just be able to configure everything have calls and puts in different colors and and you know some kind of little incremental things and then you know the risk the risk views that I developed were were really pretty good um all the different scenarios and uh and those formats were certainly much better than the just kind of off-the-shelf uh vendor things that you could buy um the you know I think some of the places where I started to pick up valuation edges though were when I started to think about kind of how the V surface evolves in the fixed income space um there was um you know a couple I don't know not that long after I started they listed um serial options so uh short dated options on longer Futures and in this case you know it was like um you know uh July and August options on September Futures so you'd have July uh August September and in the fixed income space generally the front of the curve is less volatile than further out um you know at the time typically it was the first red future so the future that's just over a year out that was the most volatile lately of course it's been further out the curve um well certainly in the period of low rates it was much further out the curve and then more recently it's it's it's moved towards the front of the curve that peak of peak volatility that area of peak volatility evolves depending on the FED regime but but generally pretty almost always the front of the curve is less volatile because of course the Fed controls the overnight rate and um and so that's relatively static and unless the FED changes it and so there was this persistent volatility roll down um where you know the front month was less volatile than the second month was less volatile than the third month was less volatile than the fourth month and so the so when they listed these serial options the July and August the natural assumption was well obviously you know June volatility is is you know 20 and September volatility is 30 then obviously July and August have to be kind of in between um but that's completely wrong because of course July is alive when the September Futures are more volatile than that forward period after July expires and so um you know if you just think about those volatility forwards obviously uh July should trade at a much higher volatility than September and August should trade somewhere in between uh the July and September but certainly you know well above September as well and so so that was kind of a a early realization that I had in in modeling the stuff and the market did not understand it that way at all um and that was definitely the kind of thing that gave me an edge because you know I had a very clear idea of what the fair value of these things were the market had a very different idea they're pretty low variance trades and uh um so you know I traded a lot of those types of things and your your trading style must have had to evolve uh you know over over time especially as we transitioned over from you know pit trading uh to electronic trading and that transition was not managed well by a lot of people obviously you being a major exception to this you you manage that transition exceptionally well and I'm wondering what that was what that was like if there were any uh you know why why do you think you were able to make that transition effectively and you know today does that coming from the pits give you edge you know you know one of the things about about the trading pits is um that you do have this uh you know it's ingrained in you that you need to be able to price anything at any time you know at a moment's notice and uh you know if you can do it in your head it's it's you have that much more of an edge and and I think that that practice is actually still useful to this day um you know when in March when suur Futures had a you know September sulur Futures had a 100 plus basis point range um just kind of thinking about the volatility surface in that in that environment and and having that kind of really intuitive grasp of what's going on um I I you know I I think that that gives you a a Perpetual Advantage um but but so shortly after I started they launched Globex uh which was an electronic trading system and um you know I I had a pretty small operation at the time but I was like I definitely want to get a Globex machine I definitely want to have a guy making markets overnight um and because that's of course how this stuff should trade um and so I was you know I was excited about it when it first happened it was funny I still remember that the Globex was something that was this the software and Hardware was actually developed by Reuters and um and CM licensed it and they handed out t-shirts on the first day that glob launched and and uh it said um c c by day on the front had a big sun and on the back of the shirt it said glow back by night with a moon I was like you know th this is s just an awesome lie and uh obviously all designed to make the pit Traders feel comfortable that they weren't you know their jobs weren't at risk um and I thought it was pretty funny in '92 I moved to London and and uh set up the the London operation and I stood in the Bund option pit for the first year and then I was traded from upstairs for the second year but but that was right when urx fought really hard to get the boond Futures to transition from life to urex and uh you know we had a a team trading the ARB between urex and and life um we had our own broker in the pit in the Bund Futures pit and you know sometimes our broker would like go out for lunch and and have a pint and then come back and like be a little bit off and I'm like you know this pit stuff is just ridiculous I mean the sooner this stuff transitions to a computer the better um and so then I moved back to Chicago in '94 and I said you know if this stuff if the CME hasn't completely transitioned to the screen by the year 2000 this place is going to be out of business and and I just couldn't have been more wrong um I I couldn't have been more wrong about the timing it took far longer than that um I think these transitions always do but but suffice it to say I was always a uh you know a big believer that of course this stuff could be handled more efficiently electronically um I I but I was definitely dead wrong about the timing it's interesting you bring that up I mean that probably meant you had more Edge for longer given that it the transition took a bit longer than you might have expected so definitely a boon in the beginning of drw but I I guess a follow-up question to something you said you said you have to be ready to price anything at any time there's a price for anything you know classic pit Trader mentality um what was it like when a whole block of this new thing called Bitcoin came up for auction sometime in 2013 or 14 and you had to Think Through pricing it and maybe starting starting a company around that how did how did that work yeah so so you know we had a number of people at drw who were interested in Bitcoin and and I started thinking about it and you know kind of read the paper and and um I I was super intrigued by it I mean this idea that you could transfer value in a trustless manner uh was very appealing to me I mean the lack of intermed medaries um uh can be you know can dramatically reduce friction of course I had a very dim view of intermediaries because over time I became the largest Trader in the EUR dollar option pit and um there were often these trades that would come through the pit and you know we would take down a huge chunk of it and then 10 minutes later the block trade would go up from the board it's like oh so some big Bank just ripped off their customer and then came and backto backed the the the trade into the pit like that's not even trading that's just ridiculous and um and these you know intermediaries are not providing a ton of value in the in the system I'm saying this in the nicest possible way at the time I wasn't saying it in such nice such a nice way um and uh and so this idea of you know of a financial system that reduced the intermediaries in the in the system was just kind of naturally a very appealing thing to me um and so uh you know so so we had all these debates about you know well is this important uh what is it that's important about it is it you know is it Bitcoin or is it blockchain I mean all that stuff that people eventually started having debates about we were having debates about in 2013 and so we decided that we would do two things we well a few things we you know we started Cumberland um to provide liquidity in in Bitcoin uh we started a company called digital asset Holdings which is based in New York that was more focused on the blockchain applications and um and we decided to buy some Bitcoin and so yes you know then uh you know the the government options came up and of course a lot of those were uh uh Silk Road coins that had been uh seized and and you know at the time there was this misperception the misperception was you know any criminal that's going to use this stuff to to do bad things and of course I I mean Bitcoin is I I guess the advantage for criminals is that they can you know uh they don't have to you know go out and pick up a a sack of uh of $100 bills or something but but the the bad thing for criminals is that every single transaction is memorialized forever and um so that just doesn't seem like a good uh a good you know uh characteristic to have if you're going to try to do something illegal of course Silk Road you know found out the hard way that that was uh in fact a really dumb thing to do um but that's actually the reason that we named Cumberland Cumberland because we figured well at the time but believes that this is only going to be uh a place for criminals so at least let's distance the brand a little bit from uh from The Core Company um yeah and so then uh you know the auction started happening and and and to us it was just a matter of of kind of pricing you know understanding the liquidity in the market and pricing the auctions accordingly when you first spun out Cumberland I actually have a question where where did where did the name come from Cumberland so uh uh so one of my longtime Partners at drw um Jeff love off was is uh you know former a lawyer in his former life and and so he often was involved in uh naming new companies um and Jeff is a big Grateful Dead fan and uh there's a you know a a mining song about the uh you know about the Cumberland BL um and uh you know given the the you know the mining Link in cryptocurrencies uh he decided to call it Cumberland so it's a it's it's a good good good story there it's a and and I get I get why in the beginning you you wanted to you you you wanted you wanted to separate it out I mean but when you were first like spinning it out when you were first thinking about what it what it could be what were you envisioning Cumberland doing or providing in the space was it was it always going to be somebody that provided provided liquidity were you thinking of it more as a risk-taking venture you know what was the you know what was the thought process behind starting yeah so so the idea was just hey that you know we we uh at drw we know how to trade we know how to take risk we know how to provide liquidity to the market and so let's do the same thing in uh in Bitcoin and that was the that was the Genesis of course with with Cumberland um you know there was it was much more kind of a a counterparty facing situation um but also you know trading on uh you know providing liquidity and other venues so I guess just a follow-up question on that um you've obviously been through multiple crypto Cycles now um and more broadly you've been through cycles of Market maturation you know you were talking about the UR Globex uh things going to the screen is there a is there a recipe for cycle survival that you would he to because you've managed to do to do this through so many different uh Peaks and troughs of you know Euphoria and despair not just in crypto but in in lots of different markets what how do you how do you think about navigating these things you know there there are two different cycles that you're talking about one is kind of a market structure cycle and the other is uh you know a hype cycle I guess um bubbles uh so so you know the way that I think about it is I just you know think about risk management first and foremost um uh I think about um um you know yeah I mean I mean really all comes down to to basic risk management by the way I I will say I think that I think that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general but especially Bitcoin is really one of the hardest instruments to uh to trade um you know a and and the only thing that is clear is that when there's um I think of it as a negatively convex instrument in that when there's a lot of hype then that increases adoption and um and that increases the probability that Bitcoin becomes viewed by a majority of the world population as a superior version of a store of value um and uh on the other hand when the price of Bitcoin declines then people become less interested and the perceived probability that Bitcoin becomes a gold replacement declines and so both of these things are kind of like so when the price is going up you know uh you can build a model that would argue that the fair value is higher than it is now and the the and conversely when the price is going down and and so it you know I think that it's actually unique um in financial instruments that have that characteris IC that's really interesting I mean I guess in Commodities you kind of have the opposite when when the price goes up too much people just demand less and then the price me reverse that's sort of my background but I guess just a follow-up question so a negatively convex asset as you described it like Bitcoin that you know creates self-fulfilling rallies and and sell-offs what about that makes it harder to trade W wouldn't you be able to just Implement a momentum strategy that that follows the the trend uh of which they're would theoretically be large ones and you know yeah I mean I mean maybe it's a momentum strategy but but it has big troughs and valys along the way and and so you know it's very easy to you know if you don't have conviction to to get washed out you know if your strategy is kind of a levered long and oh if it starts to go down I'm going to get out um it's probably a money losing proposition are there any other markets that you've seen that trade similarly to this or what is another way of saying what is the most similar Market you've seen if any to to to crypto I I think it's really it's a very different Market I guess that the closest thing you know I I mean I mean you see some similar price patterns in um in emerging Technologies um and you know this kind of you know like the internet bubble and and um that kind of thing but but I would argue that those things are fundamentally different because still you're talking about the valuation of a company and um you ultimately have to make certain assumptions about the earnings of that company and market share and total addressable Market um and in Bitcoin it's you know it's not an earnings question it's just a question of is this a superior store of value to gold and and uh um and that's really all a question of how many how what percentage of the world population feels that way yeah and it's and it's and it's very it it does it does also seem to be that the answer to that question is is almost a little bit path dependent it's like the more you know the the more the more people that adopted in a in in a short in a shorter period of time leads to crazier momentum and crazier outperformance um so you know it's like it's a pretty it's you know from from mine definitely a very very interesting interesting asset to trade and one one thing one thing that you said one thing that you said in there is uh emerging emerging Tech sometimes acts uh like like crypto and we've been hit with this recent wave of uh of AI applications and and llms and and they've at least even in the short term over the last six seven months since chat gbt really went viral there's been so much discussion about how it might impact our jobs as as as PE as people that deal with the financial markets and and you know a lot more than just that and you as somebody that has navigated a lot of change when it comes to technology and how it impacts financial markets how do you see this recent development and and are you are you keeping are you keeping your eyes on it yeah so right now I'm in Woodside California I'm 10 from Stanford um uh I you know met with a bunch of uh AI people over the last few days um and I've been coming here regularly and doing that um so yeah I I think that it's a it's it is a consequential technology um you know the The Innovation that's taking place in uh you know even specifically in llms is is really very interesting um and so I think it will have all sorts I think it will have I think it will impact pretty much everything um aside from you know somebody that's living off the grid in a cabin in the woods so is this kind of a um is this kind of one of those moments in let's say Financial history where an enterprising young person can go back to to their studio apartment uh and use some new technology to print out some sheets and then come back to the pit the next day and and uh and win is is the llm sort of the the modern equivalent of that uh in that it will give the first group of traders who figure it out an edge and if so how do you think so yeah so so it's entirely possible um uh but it's unclear I I I'm convinced that llms are going to be uh really useful for thinking about some aspects of markets and risk-taking um but it's it's pretty unclear um exactly what those are and and uh how much human intervention you need in that process so it's all it's all you know it's a matter of I I think it's like will be discovered very shortly and then the technology will continue to evolve and so the answer to those questions will almost certainly change it's it's kind of interesting to think about like hey are we at this deep blue moment where technology is about to beat human Traders at you know at their game or are we more at the kind of CM going to screen moment where it just uh should have happen years ago and it it still hasn't um well now it has but maybe in 2000 so I guess are you is it has AI thus far changed the way that you run your life or your business or your approach to markets or are you just still in kind of uh information absorption mode yeah right now I'm in information absorption mode I wouldn't say that I've changed anything meaningful other than spending time on it please let me know when you do know I think one of the uh one of one of the great quotes that you had I was I was reading reading some of uh some of the articles that you had been mentioned in before doing doing doing the podcast and I found I found a really funny quote that I liked uh which is that when the LM had their nickel incident you called it one of the most inep moves I've ever seen an exchange make and I thought that was uniquely funny for somebody that spent so much time in crypto you know because uh We've obviously had our fa our fair share of uh dealing uh deal deal dealing with venues um and you know one one question I had is you you've seen the crypto Market evolve in terms of liquidity uh o over time and and I'm curious how how you've sort of how you view the last you know I guess eight years nine years since you've been in crypto and how it's how it's evolved and where you think it's going to go in the next five years yeah um here you know obviously there's a lot less um at least from outside the crypto Community there's a lot less excitement about it than there was you know maybe pre FTX blowing up um but I still think that there 's uh really important innovation that's taking place in the space um you know I think that the ability to move um to move value instantaneously and uh um you know and and if you want trustless Le is a really important innovation I think that um applying leveraging that technology for traditional financial markets is one of the most uh exciting and impactful ways that um that this technology is going to be used and so I'm super excited to to see that unfold which it will yeah do do you think on in in the terms of in terms of uh the way that we interact with the with the markets so right now obviously in the traditional world use there's a separation between where liquidity lives where you C the that asset uh you know who who can who can who can provide leverages the exchange that provid as leverages the Brokers that provide right is the primes that provide leverage do you think that system is where crypto will eventually go to like do you think that's the end point of financial markets or do you think that crypto is going to show us a different a different way that financial markets could operate I'm I'm curious your take on on that yeah so so it's I think it's um let's see so so first of all you know in the centralized crypto exchange space you know these exchanges decide that they should do everything you know they should be the fcm they should be the DCM the dco um and then in addition to that they should provide leverage um and and of course you know as I was watching this unfiled I said you know this is inherently less stable um one of the nice things about traditional financial markets is that by breaking up these different uh you know these different responsibilities you get more transparency and you get more safety and resilience um now obviously when you switch over to the defi World it it does enable you to open up those different responsibilities to different Market participants in an even more granular way then you can do in traditional finance and it also opens up the ability to uh provide shortterm loans to do um you know to um move money instantaneously it's it's one of the things that you know the lme decided to um to not ask for margin because uh it was going to blow up um some of the large nickel producers and then of course they decided to cancel all the trades one day uh because you know it they were worried that a bunch of me you know clearing members and customers would default and so that's one way of running things um the other way of running things is to say hey we're going to move value in real time when there's a margin deficit you know you top it up right now and of course you have the ability to do that because you can move money on chain and my belief is that that actually leads us to a more transparent more safe more resilient uh Market Financial market and and that is the promise of of a lot of this technology that will in fact enable that to happen so what types of time frames if you had to make a sort of a prediction would you say we're looking at when it comes to um the blockchain ification of certain assets perhaps nickel um things that right now aren't necessarily associated with crypto yeah so so I'm perpetually wrong in estimates like that so I always think they're going to happen sooner than they will so whatever I say just take the over um uh so that's one thing the other thing is of course there are some assets that are um that are physical assets and you know like nickel so you know yeah you can put nickel on a blockchain But ultimately the nickel has to sit somewhere and if you know somebody steals the nickel then you know you have a blockchain that represents nickel and the nickel's not there and that's a problem right so so that kind of stuff is something that still has this uh intimate link to the physical world that is super critical um now there are other instruments that are already virtual instruments like you know equities and and treasuries and um you know people don't usually walk around with their chair certificates and and I think that those uh assets probably lend themselves more to um to digitization to blockchain isation um and so so I think that that stuff is going to happen I mean you know like right now we're experimenting with intraday repo um using blockchain technology so that's on top of uh Canton uh which is digital asset Holdings uh blockchain and um uh you know so and that's kind of powered by by broadridge um so that's an example of um of experimenting with you know the kind of the early days of using this technology to do that and ultimately of course what that does is it enables um value to be moved in real time and even 247 and that's the kind of thing that does will make Clearing Houses more resilient if they want to Avail them themselves of that of that uh technology interesting so I guess just a quick follow-up question if you could tell the listeners a bit more about digital asset Holdings the Canton blockch chain and what sort of problems it solves that perhaps ethereum doesn't I think it'd be really useful for everyone to learn about yeah so so uh you know ethereum is obviously a a very powerful Network um you know tons of of energy and participation one of the drawbacks of ethereum is that every single transaction is is public um and of course you know for most people if they buy or sell a security they don't want the whole world to know they bought or sold that security um you know probably fine depending on the market structure for their counterparty to know uh maybe for a regulator to know maybe for a a clearing house to know maybe for a prime broker to know but um you know for for any given instrument and any given transaction the um you want to be able to really control who could who can see that um and so the it advantage of Canton and then the smart contract language on top of it which is called daml um is that it has uh configurable privacy which was built you know at the core of this uh of this chain um and this is something that the the team's been working on since 2014 so this is a very long very long uh process to um you know to build a blockchain that works with those characteristics I think it would be helpful to expand on what what is the current what what is the issue with the current stack that doesn't allow this to happen right with the current with the current architecture why why can't we why can't we achieve this uh so in in currently in traditional financial markets yeah yeah it's you know it's uh you know why why is that why is what Canton you know enables not not necessarily possible I mean I think you know for for us here we're we're participants in the in the financial Market we understand the value that blockchain can bring can bring to the table um but I think it'd be useful for you know people that are less familiar to to sort of understand you know what what the current what you know a lot of the current issues yeah so right now if you want to um wire money um you know that can take it can take hours and of course you can only do it when the wire windows open open um and so you know let's say that you have on a um you know a spread between a Futures Contract that's in London and a Futures Contract that's in the United States and then after London hours there's a big you know a big rally um and you're you know long the long the Futures in London and you're short the Futures in the US um you know the idea that you could pull variation margin out of the London market and move it over to satisfy the negative variation that you're experiencing in the US I I mean like you're not even close um you know what actually what will happen is the next day that Futures Contract will rally you know assuming then the next day we open up and the markets unchanged you know then the London Futures Contract will rally the variation margin will show up in your account at that point you know you can wire it out maybe that day maybe the next day um you know maybe now you're running into the weekend and so uh the whole system is just very um clunky it's it's a lot of it is batch um so you you know you have these uh cycles that kind of process like once a day or twice a day um and um and and so it just makes everything very slow to move around it means that you need to have a lot of extra capital in the system system in order to deal with um that lack of um you know with all those delays that take place yeah I think I think that's that that that's very helpful helpful framing for people you know it's it's just it's something that we're we're honestly blessed with as people that are in that are in crypto uh you know we we use a system that is accessible 247 and uh you know every time I go back to the uh you know quote quote traditional markets I'm I'm always I feel I always leave feeling a little bit disappointed with what with what I can do uh you know what is what is possible and and and what isn't and then I I I flee back into my metamask and uh and end up and end up much happier um so you know it's uh it's it's good it's good to hear these these these problems these problems are being tackled and you know it's something that uh we we we look out as well um you we I I one last one last question for for you Don you know I think when when people think of uh you know when people think of the Chicago Chicago trading firms a lot of people think of you know high frequency taking taking bips uh here here and there a lot of it a lot of its Arbitrage and I think a lot of your career has been has been characterized by finding these types of Arbitrage opportunities but you also you You' you've Al you also take take risk you know uh and and so I'm love to hear about your process as uh I think our listeners would love to hear too about you you your process for decision- making uh when it comes when it when it comes to risk taking and you know what what you think has helped you the most in your in in your career when it comes to be being right yeah so so you know obviously the little arbitrages are great um uh because you can generate these very high sharp High return trades but the reality is they don't persist uh markets constantly become more efficient and and those things quickly get our out and so building a business that just relies on capturing those little arbitrages is you know it's not sustainable um and so uh you know being comfortable moving out the risk curve is is super important now obviously if you can move out the risk curve and you have access to super low latency uh tools and connectivity then you're in a really strong spot and that's where we try to be um but when I think about risk so when when I think about markets or really most things in the world um I I see a series of probability distributions um and um and and so it's it's when if you look at the world as a series of probability distributions then you're kind of well set up to think about about risk and um and so any time that there's some kind of a perceived dislocation in the market um because when there's a dislocation in the market when there's a violent move you know that there's a high probability that it's mispriced either it was mispriced before or it's mispriced now um or I mean okay probably there's some fundamental thing that changed but high probability that still mispriced because um you know new information has come out and there's been a dramatic move and um so so the way I think about it is is I I um think about what are the drivers of this price action what are the drivers of supply and demand um if it's a commodity or what are the drivers of the fed's reaction function and then on top of that the supply and demand for for kind of the hedging need of this part of the interest rate curve and um and then I try to think about you know what are the things that could change going forward that will um shift the fed's reaction function one way or another um uh you know what is um what will cause the FED to ease right after Silicon Valley Bank uh the interest rate Market priced in a kind of an expectation that the Fed was going to ease by 100 basis points by the end of the year um and of course you know that's not what happened I mean so far the FED has hiked 50 basis points since then and I expect the fed you know may well hike again before the end of the year I expect the FED won't ease by the end of the year but and of course you know those outcomes were all within the probability distribution but my view at the time was that that uh the probability of the FED easing by the end of the year was massively over overpriced that part of the distribution and the part about you know the part of the distribution of the FED continues to hike was significantly underpriced and and um so you know I start with that and then think about okay what's the best way of expressing that risk that that that makes that makes a a ton of sense I I always I I try I I always try to think similarly I think one of the hardest parts is constructing that probability distribution is thinking about okay well what what are the criteria that actually go into building this out it's like okay I think this is a 60% chance of you know this and then 30 and then but then it turns out that you were just completely wrong no I mean I mean coming up with your own subjective measures of the probability distribution is super hard um and and especially when the Market's saying something very different yep as a closing closing question here are there any uh trades that you you know you really really loved that you can talk about here maybe maybe your favorite trade ever if you're if you're willing if you're willing to disclose it that you can think back on and say hey I I I really really loved putting this one on and you know I don't know if it made you the most money or was most interesting yeah I mean I mean here you know I I've done lots of lots of Trades that I really loved um uh I I mean this year I I will say that the dislocation what I perceived as a complete dislocation in the interest rate market after Silicon Valley Bank was was one of my favorite trades um uh I thought that that that that was such there was such a gap between my perception of the uh you know what the probability distribution should be and the markets implied probability distribution um I thought that was just phenomenal um but you know going back in time um one of the trades that and this is a different type of trade but but um you know in 2008 when Leman went bankrupt we were one of a handful of firms that the CME called to ask to price the their portfolio and um um you know we were well prepared for it you know got the whole portfolio from the from the CME broke it down into different chunks of risk had different teams price the risk you know added it up and then submitted the aggregate bid it was actually by product but but uh you know we ended up being the best bid in something like three of the five uh buckets of in the auction and um and there's something you know and then when we did win those buckets we were super efficient about you know hedging off that risk um in you know in kind of the the optimal way and you know all of that that entire process obviously took um a lot of confidence in um in how we were thinking about the risk and and how we were modeling the risk and that ability to then aggregate it up and and in a very volatile environment say and you know here's our number that's it's an awesome story part of History right there it's pretty cool yeah I was I was part of the Leman portfolio but I didn't get acquired what happened there I had to go find a find a different job after that I I had I had a follow-up question for you Don um does your you know another auction does your Bitcoin trade factor into maybe the top five trades or did did that feel like a uh more of a venture thing than a trade uh I I'm sorry which one the the Bitcoin trade the silk R auction you know I mean so that was a series of auctions and and they were really in in relatively small uh in in terms of risk um I mean they were interesting right you know the first one we' never kind of interacted with the United States Marshals um and um but but yeah I I mean I thought it was a fairly vanilla process I thought they did a good job thinking about how to you know how to uh maximize the value and and we were very comfortable trading the asset class so it it it was great well Don thank you so much don't don't want to take up too much more of your time have to get back to uh oh oh I guess we lost on just you said we don't want to take up too much to more your time it sometimes very valuable Jonah so really enjoyed this conversation uh I I really you know I think I think I I think I learned a lot I came away thinking about it if I although if I had to say one thing that I I'd really like to dive into you more is I need to figure out how he constructs those probability distributions me too like what what goes into that but you know I I've tried a few times uh he he's the master at it more more just trying to learn that up well thank you all for joining us uh it was a wonderful conversation really looking forward to you know the next episode AI as always absolute pleasure to co-host this with you and um again none of this is financially advice [Music]

Transcript Text:
when you get these headlines now like First Republic failing or pack West failing or Western Alliance failing and you get a move up from Bitcoin if you don't see the equity markets doing the same thing then you might want to say it all right welcome back to our third episode of thousand X it's kind of hilarious because I'm looking at the price of Bitcoin right now and I don't think it has changed much since the last episode even though it's been two weeks and I feel like a lot has happened we're basically at the same prices at the end of the last episode you you asked me hey Jonah what first 24K or 30k um we both said 24K did it touch 30k almost it was very close so I think I think we were saved by like 200 dollars the high was 29 959 so we didn't I didn't quite get there I would still characterize that as being wrong but technically we're not wrong yet and we're back at the same prices I I like that a lot has changed a lot has changed I think one of the one of the more interesting things uh that that happened in the last two weeks was the the failure of First Republic uh and the and the after the aftershocks of that we we have pacquest and Western Alliance kind of kind of you know collapsing you know in on themselves and I do think uh Bitcoin definitely got a boost from that a short-term boost but I'm getting kind of worried and I don't know if you're uh if you're feeling this too where the narrative was for the longest time since svb bank failures good for Bitcoin but we're kind of seeing that not play out as much anymore and I'm starting to think back to svb and think about well what was the real driver of Bitcoin price action like what was the most important part and instead of reallocation because of bank failure I'm thinking maybe it was just the stimulus effect of the FED saying and the FDIC saying we're basically going to backstop all banks and so now every further bank failure that we get has less of that effect because we already know that that like that is being that's priced in right if First Republic fails and their deposits are backstop well that's priced in because nobody was pricing that them going under in the same way right it's a good point you make um but I'm not sure how much of it is priced in I'm not sure I agree with you in in the entirety of that statement um I I'm kind of leaning the opposite direction as you I'm starting to get a little bit more confident and feeling more bullish uh rather than more more scared of being bullish I think the reason is um you know I think since the start of this Bank bailout situation occurred with the FDIC backstopping the Regionals 300 billion dollars is what that costs staggering numbers uh when you compare it to like what happened in 08 you know that they're they're happy to just dispense of 300 billion to backstop a couple of Banks and depositors uh in a couple of Banks and that basically unwinds the entire deflationary effect of what was going on prior to that with um you know the treasury letting or sorry the uh the FED letting some of their Holdings roll off um pretty remarkable so I think you could say there are what's priced in is a few more Regional Banks failing and maybe another bailout or two but I I think if you you take the view that this Cascade is just going to continue until the entire Regional banking system has been subsumed by bulge brackets like JP Morgan and B of A uh I don't think that amount of bailout has been priced in so maybe we're somewhere in between yeah I I think I I yeah you're you're definitely right that the long-term uh if in the long term what ends up happening is all a lot of these Regional Banks a majority of these Regional Banks get subsumed I don't think that's being priced in that's correct but I do think a few more bank failures what every subsequent bank failure is less stimulus unless it's a ton of bank failures right so obviously if you get like 50 or 60 then that's going to be more than than just you know five or six but what I'm saying is that every subsequent one is just less stimulus in in the market I think that's it's just more it's more priced in and so the court the core of the question also is like okay well why are people reallocating to big or why are people allocating to bitcoin um with svb I think what was kind of interesting is that Bitcoin led the s p but the s p rebounded too which I think is important to remember right risk markets went up after svb it just set up and the Bitcoin went up first and went up faster I think a lot of it was because it was a weekend um but you know it went up first when a faster was the fastest horse because I think people were allocating to it based off of okay well this is stimulus and this is some sort of narrative so therefore we're going to bet we're going to bet on this thing um and so what that tells me though is like if I were to like let's say we ran a regression on it right and we said two variables stimulus Equity markets going up and then narrative I'd bet that it would be 80 20 right it'd be 80 stimulus 20 narrowed that would be my bet and so the reason that that's important is that when you get these headlines now like First Republic failing or act West failing or Western Alliance failing and you get a move up from Bitcoin if you don't see the equity markets doing the same thing then you might want to fade it that's that's sort of that's that that that's sort of the out that's like the outcome oriented approach like if you see if pack West goes down next week and bitcoin's up four percent like to me that seems like a sale as opposed to a buy because of that Dynamic I hear you I mean I guess maybe one Dynamic that boosted us so much in March when svb went down was the fact that Circle um Circle Financial the you know the issuer of usdc dollar coin um held three billion plus worth of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank so if you are holding usdc at that time there is an actual impetus for you to rotate out of your usdc and into eth on uniswap or something or or off chain um because your your dollars were theoretically at risk whereas when if you're a crypto holder and First Republic Bank goes down or Zion's Bancorp goes down or any of these other regionals like for the most part uh you're either not exposed or you don't know if you're exposed or you're just straight up in who cares territory so maybe there's a little bit less like impulse to trade as there as there was back then still The Narrative did cause a pop and you're absolutely right it was a fade meanwhile you know the biggest bank of them all uh the United States Treasury Uncle Sam you know that that one's looking a little shaky as well and uh I don't know if we if we let's say we had a technical default where the United States just doesn't pay back bondholders for a little while what do you think the price of Bitcoin is in that scenario I think that depends heavily on uh heavily on gold my bet my bet is that headline sends us past 30. maybe to 35. um I had this is it I had this tweet it's like I think I think we get to 35k uh if we if if that headline comes out people said that I was not sufficiently bullish enough so I quote tweeted it and I said okay fine all-time Highs but I think like the reaction to that tweet uh is is telling so I that that quote tweet was definitely a joke I think that we were probably capping out at you know 30 35k or 30 36k unless uh you get that and then like a really quick what I what I could see like really propelling us if if I you know if we're hopeful to get to 40 or more is the debt ceiling happens people panic you get like a short-term move down in Risk markets and then it's very quickly resolved and it's behind us and we come out with a good with a good conclusion and Bitcoin has all this narrative behind it already and then risk markets start ripping again then that's I think it's like similar to the SBB situation right where it's you kind of you kind of need that Confluence I think that I think you know cues have to go up I think spy has to go up in order for Bitcoin to get to in order for Bitcoin to get to all-time Highs but if you get that narrative juice and then you get that turn around I mean buy as much upside ball as you possibly can and just just kind of wait it out you know it's interesting you mentioned upside wall I think it's very rare to talk about a mega cap asset that could double in price in the next month or two and you know I'm I'm less sanguine about it I think I think you know we could definitely see all-time highs on short order if the United States were to default and it's crazy that we even have to talk about this like um if you have a spr whoever you are wherever you live in the world if you have a spreadsheet with money in it you have to rewrite some cells and some formulas if the United States defaults like the risk-free rate is no longer risk-free um the the value of investing money well you know or or holding money now versus having money later changes drastically um it it could possibly be you know the most seminal event in financial history and it could occur not because of an inability to pay but just an unwillingness to pay back debt I mean there are a few scenarios we can talk through around that but I I think you'd see Bitcoin test seventy eighty thousand dollars if people need to move money out of you know much like they move money out of usdc and into crypto when Silicon Valley Bank was under duress and eventually failed I think you'd see people move money out of Fiat and into crypto in droves if Fiat suddenly became unstable if you're holding Fiat right now you're holding t-bills and earning earning yield you're not holding cash and letting it burn I think I think you're insane I don't think that's going anywhere in your side I think this is going on maybe maybe we should just fight each other on Twitter but yeah fair enough I I mean I I would obviously love that I think uh you know it'd make my uh it'd make my summer a lot better could definitely could definitely do a lot more things but you know I I I don't think that that's feasible to get to to get to get to 70 mostly because I just I just don't know where that where that buying is coming from because you know even if we hit the debt ceiling and that that issue comes out okay let's think of let's think of the market participants right who are actually you're actually gonna be buying this thing I don't think retail's not buying on it they might buy a little bit on it I think you need to cat like it you might you know you'd probably need to get through 35 40 to get to get retail to get retail back in and even then retail doesn't feel as rich or as bored as they were during covet so there's there's hardness it's harder to get them in you don't think even a few basis points of retail would say hey I'm just gonna go buy a little bit of Bitcoin on my Robinhood account just because something you got a frenzy the high net worth guys I think they they do drive it forward and I think those guys take it to 35. so remember like I am bullish uh so I do think you get you get some allocation from the high net worth the institutions are going to take too long like no institution is going to say I'm buying Bitcoin now because of this not even able to get coin Futures on the CME I think unactivated yeah I think it would just take like take them time to make that decision uh and then the slow allocators may or may not change their Pace based on it um and I say all this because I think in order to get back to 70 you need you like need all of those groups to be firing in all cylinders and so if you don't have all those groups firing on all cylinders it's just harder it's just it's just harder to see um but I do think you know 3540 is a is a reason is a reasonable Target although you know I I'd re I'd reassess I'd reassess there one thing that I was um thinking about and you know I'd love I actually I'm I'm taking this a slightly slightly different way but I'd love to get you I'd love to get your thoughts on this or in 2021 there was such a perfect storm of you're locked in your house you have stimulus checks you you can't do anything your entire life has just gone online and that led to crypto going nuts do you think we'll ever get circumstances like that again that will lead to a crazy run like 2021 and if so how do you think we get there oh man it's a great question I think um I don't think we'll ever like history doesn't repeat itself but it often Rhymes as the saying goes so I don't think we'll we'll get another lockdown with a bunch of stimulus checks but I you know I can see a different type of perfect storm and you know one of the themes that we play on in a thousand X is how old I am and how young you are I would I would put more the question more on you and you know gen Z people who whenever I talk to them it seems like they're they're less doing the sorts of things that that I did when I was young and more like just chasing apparitions of Pokemon around abandoned Lots with their phone or you know living on fortnite watching a con Travis Scott concert on the internet like at some point I think enough of these people are going to grow up and have enough percentage of human productive hours spent online that you know crypto internet money is going to become more of uh more of a thing than than Fiat for a lot of people um I think that the seamlessness of the experience of moving value around and moving digital goods and services around relative to moving actual goods and services and and fiat currency um it's such a drastic improvement you know as the the founder of fireblock says it's 30 acts better it's not 30 better um you know I think eventually for certain people you will have that perfect storm of just constant economic activity inside of some game or or reality that isn't necessarily what uh what US olds think of as normal what do you think yeah I think I think all that's all that's correct so I think there are two things that stand out to me as major you know headwind or not a Tailwinds for crypto not headwinds is one that wealth transfer from Boomers like you people like me come on it's like you know is it parents as parents get older I think that that reallocation is going to bring is going to bring a lot of money into digital assets great I also I also do think uh you know I I I tweet I tweeted this out but I was in uh I was I was in South America last last month and one thing that struck me was just that crypto is a genuine thing there like you can actually go buy things with crypto there are people that use crypto there I talked about like random people that would bring it up and like had Finance accounts and like ever ever you know and so I think what what could end up happening is that as you get you know population growth from those areas as those areas get wealthier the allocation of crypto grows grows grows grows grows a little grows a little bit more um you know as the rest of the world gets wealthier relative to places like the US and and and the UK where allocations are are a bit lower and then here's my little like conspiracy theory or not conspiracy theory but far-fetched uh idea I think could lead to a crazy Bull Run is we have okay so we have inflation right now right how do you solve for inflation well one way is to raise rates another way is to increase productivity and AI is radically increasing productivity in certain Niche areas right now it's very possible that in a year in two years and three years we're back into structural deflation because the productivity gains that AI has delivered us have just gone through the roof and then you get a crazy bull market from Tech you probably like it's very possible that if this thesis is true the 10-year is just ripping forever like like we we saw Peak rates already that's that's possible uh and then at some point A lot of people are going to lose their jobs and I don't know whether it's three years four years five years six years eight years from now but Ubi starts to become a very very very real discussion and I think that could create an environment that's very good yeah how do you how do you escape if you're in Ubi world and you know obviously the the steps it would take to get there controversial but if you live in Ubi world how do you differentiate yourself from the pack well you have to invest well basically um so now here's the question speaking of uh old world things that could potentially transform themselves into explosive digital economies digital products uh uh way back when I was young you'd get in your car drive to the gas station and buy a lottery ticket and that was your your way to you know potentially get rich um Without Really Trying that hard one thing that I was thinking about recently amidst the this meme coin frenzy is isn't this just a a digitally native more exciting and younger version of going and buying a lottery ticket and what would it be like if you took the total Global spend on lottery tickets and just saw that you know over the course of the next I don't know how many decades just turned into Global spend on memecoin lotteries um what would the market capitalization of meme coins be if you if you brought that spend online the US spent 74 billion dollars on lottery tickets last year according to google in one year in one year yeah 74 billion dollars of money were used to buy lottery tickets that's right yeah so you know thinking of life isn't absurdly High number that's just America um you know what what percent of the total crypto market cap is at it's like a solid five five percent yeah five percent of total like total crypto market cap yeah this is 74 billion dollars of buying of crypto this stuff is up 2X yeah and so 74 billion dollars of buying does not equate to 74 billion dollars worth of market capitalization maybe it's 10x that amount so basically what I was thinking was you know to your question about what causes that perfect storm I think you know wealth transfer as you know younger people inherit cash um and just a digitally native version of activity that took place that has taken place for a very long time but you know in a more uh let's call it flashy and appealing way to younger Generations that could create a you know all sorts of activity yeah I mean that would be yeah I I actually didn't realize that that was the total total amount of money spent on lottery tickets but that makes a ton of sense right I mean crypto at the end at the end of the day is a large portion of it is the fact that it's a massive Casino when you have things like when what was what actually the one thing that changed dramatically from last week was the market cap of Pepe yeah I mean that's been for a wild ride but you know that's kind of like comparable to uh the price of a square mile of real estate on what is now the Las Vegas Strip right it kind of went from worthless to maybe a few hundred grand to worth billions and maybe back down and then back up again through some various recessionary scenarios but you have to think that some of this value trickles down um to the ethereum network because you know lottery tickets Casinos gambling that's but one of the many products and services offered on this on this L1 um and that's I think why gas has been so consistently high for for the last few weeks is this type of activity it's just been a crazy uh a crazy uptake in uh in in Meme coinery and it's all it's all retail I mean it's you know it's very hard for institutions to go touch this stuff as much as you know but as much as you might think that we don't pay attention to it we very much so pay attention to it because it's a great signal I think for a lot of things um you know one one thing that was very heavily debated and like group chats and internally was does did the Pepe blow off and the crazy amount of capital that flew into Pepe was that a sign for the health of the market this is a debate and I'll give you I'll give you the two sides as I see it and then you know I'd love to hear love to hear where you sort of fall out on that is maybe have a third or fourth or fifth side but the two sides as I say this one meme coins generally mean blow off which one you have nothing better to do with with your money it sucks liquidity out of Bitcoin and ethereum and that causes Bitcoin ethereum to go down and if nobody's allocating Bitcoin in ethereum then the meme coin can only go up for so long and then everything starts crashing because people reallocate out of Bitcoin ethereum Bitcoin ethereum go down goes in meme coin right so it's like a liquidity the liquidity suck their thesis the the other side is that it's just a isolated it's an isolated run Pepe was the only thing that was running it was kind of the only meme coin that was that that was in existence it kind of existed in its in its own world and there's not that much liquidity there's like 50 million dollars of liquidity backing a 1.5 billion dollar chick coin uh you know I guess uh now now it's now it's less but at the time I saw that saw the analysis so it's uh you know that's that's sort of the two two approaches to it and I I don't know if we've gotten that we've gotten an answer yet but um curious your take yeah I mean I I have kind of uh a Trad fire informed take on this um thank you for asking I think it's uh I think it's a new use case emerging and the reason why is you know the lottery example that I gave earlier to me this is a lottery and so far the two biggest use cases for you know ethereum have been well blockchains in general have been defying nfts in terms of computing and obviously the OG use case is cryptocurrency Bitcoin the Bitcoin L1 supports a currency called Bitcoin that is useful to a lot of people believe it or not stable coins are another use case but like to me this Lottery this online Lottery accessible to the entire world is a use case and so many times you know as a Commodities Trader I used to trade crude oil like one thing that you learn is that as entrepreneurs in Commodities markets um the biggest entrepreneurs who generate the most wealth do so by taking a waste product and turning it into a useful product what I mean by that is like natural gas was literally burned at the Wellhead until you know somebody thought hey this is a cleaner fuel that we can use to heat our homes right um Vaseline a lubricant that you you may or may not be familiar with is uh used to be a waste product or the refining process and then Exxon just started selling it for what it's currently used for um and made a fortune right so if you take a waste product and you turn into a useful product you make a fortune anyway before these these conversions occur markets often disc Commodities markets often dismiss this stuff as crap as a waste of time a problem a waste of resources and you know it's interesting I I sit here as a you know at an Institutional firm servicing institutional counterparties taking institutional risk and thinking and listening to people dismiss this Pepe [ __ ] as just some sort of waste of of block space I'm thinking like maybe maybe not maybe maybe the cree creators of of these types of erc20 tokens which are consuming so much gas and could theoretically be considered waste products are actually useful products insofar as people demand the lottery style upside for minimal effort in the society it's human nature I don't know that would be a one one kind of crazy take on it yeah no I'm I'm I'm with you and at some point you know as institutions we might have to get comfortable speculating on these things you know for for now for for now I think we you know it's hard to like if we were to put one percent of our fund into into Pepe and then we lost it I don't think our LPS would be particularly hard to justify right it's like they look at us and they go why did you buy a coin based after a [ __ ] that doesn't do anything you go well you know could have could have gone up 100 x it didn't but it could have right and so I'm kind of wondering if you know this plus Doge is gonna get LPS and people more comfortable with the idea that you can have these like crazy lottery tickets and they kind of sometimes make sense in a portfolio portfolio context um you know there there was some like options institutional lottery tickets call options yeah there was some uh I think to your point of uh to to your general point of hey this is this is a big use case in crypto a funny statistic was that if you bought every single meme coin that was launched over the last year or something like that you ended and you started with 10K you ended up with something like a mill a lot of it coming from Pepe but also from other coins over the last year which has been a pretty dire year for yeah yeah it's like over the last year it's kind of not God it's crazy because you you end up getting these things super early uh and like some of them end up with like five million dollar market caps or 10 million dollar whatever some of them end up going to 1.5 Bill apparently uh so this is uh you know I'm not advocating for people to go put their money into meme coins but there's some sort of strategy that could probably be developed around this right like if I was if if this is a question for you before you go on yeah let's say that you were going to launch the golden coin meme coin index fund that does that actually does that how would that be a full-time job for somebody or two or three people just to accomplish that feat of getting into all of those tracking it all how would you set that up yeah so I mean I actually think it'd be like for some enterprising young guy out there or woman it's gonna it's probably a good idea to think about hey how do I extract the most value uh from from like trading like what should be what should I be spending my time with you any sort of technical ability and AI could actually chargeable team might actually be able to help with this uh is you can start screening contracts for uh specific red flags so imagine you scanned you know you you scanned ethereum and you look for new smart contracts that were launched and every single time a new smart contract came out uh for for a token that was uh you know a simple meme coin you'd pull in you'd pull in the data and then you ask Chad GPT or you'd ask yourself like hey or what are the red flags like do they have any specific functions that allow you that either restrict you from selling so there are a lot that will say Hey you actually can't sell there are a lot that are like upgradable contracts like can can they upgrade the contract may or may not be a red flag uh you know do they have the ability to Mint additional tokens that would be that would be a big good big red flag so they're also all these sorts of functions that you can go look for in these smart contracts like okay well you compile a list of things that make you want to buy something and make you not want to buy something so you start running a running a screener and to figure out well what are the optimal meme coins to buy now then you probably after like I don't know this is probably like a month or two of work is what I would assume you probably have a pretty good system for picking up meme coins and you can actually probably run that as a strategy but that's that's at least my first my first instinct here is that there's that there's definitely a way to to go screen these these coins in a systematic and programmatic manner make that bet over and over and over and then just call it a day right uh scale that I would use that like scale that and there's no way there's also no way I was the first one to think of this I'm sure that there are people out there doing it and I'm actually now that I think about it more probably a lot of volume like initial volume on these things comes from people doing that is what I would assume um so like the other way to the other way the other way to do it is if there if my theory is true and there are that many people that are running these Bots then like to it you create a meme coin specifically designed to attract bot liquidity right so like you like try to reverse engineer the Bots and figure out what they look for in Moon coins and then make a meme coin with exactly like those those parameters and then you lock it it gets it gets bought by a bunch of those Bots then you just like sell into them and you do that like over and over and over and over could be kind of funny uh the smartest bot people are focused on sandwich trading and Mev meanwhile you when they Zig you sag well you know you know what they say it's it's not about it's not about how good you are it's about the table that you play at you know that's a very good point and uh the table that I play at is increasingly graying and aging so I guess I use chat GPT more just to remind myself how certain financial math works and less to like come up with the screener schemes to you know identify meme coins and potentially profit from them but you know what this is this is fascinating stuff um but one thing that that I think that I think we're both realizing just from digging into a topic that neither of us really took seriously even two or three weeks ago is Echoes the broader theme that maybe these things aren't going away maybe even those 16 guise neutral gas levels for Ethan we're consistently averaging 50 to 150 Guai ethos deflationary is crazy it doesn't doesn't you know all of this activity the fact that it isn't going away and the fact that there are like pearls or kernels of an investment thesis inside of it means that maybe we should just get used to this and even if it does eventually die down the East that's being burned as a result of of this activity is never coming back so it is real and does need to be taken seriously for what it is so I guess on that note I have a question for you Avi um the question is all right we're burning a lot of ease gas you know sorry ether's deflationary against the backdrop of this high gas environment which is occurring because of the meme coin frenzy then you have Bitcoin transactions which are through the roof because of ordinals which maybe you could explain in a minute but um should we just get used to this higher blockchain activity Paradigm what does it mean for price and what does it mean for supply and demand of block space is there an investment thesis there so all very very good questions and I'll start by saying the best thing that ethereum ever did was eip1559 for itself I mean it just like did it opened the door for so much institutional Capital to come in the space I gave a I gave a talk last week at a at a conference that was filled with a lot of uh you know pension fund allocators a lot of institutional allocators and I was uh the second session in the in in the morning and I got an obscene amount of questions on it and one of the things that I brought up was hey ethereum is gender in generating a substantial amount of money a year in quote unquote Revenue through its fever right if he annualizes out to five billion dollars a year and burn fees that's pretty substantial buyback right quote unquote uh ether's deflationary and this is all during a bear Market it's not even a bull market ethereum prices you know it's up to start the year sure but it's not like we we don't have a frenzy by any by any means and so that really hit home for a lot of people and so what I'm seeing is that if as activity like really picks up all right you're gonna get a lot of people that are actually going to start buying based off over the back of that uh you know you know there was there was a note put out by a sell side desk on uh on you know eth being deflationary and a lot of allocators are looking at that very seriously in a way that is actually quite bearish for things like Solana even though my prior bullishness on on Solana not notwithstanding I'm still bullish on it short term midterm maybe less long-term because of uh the fact that if these L ones don't generate fees in the same way and burn those fees and generate revenue for their shareholders in the same way that ethereum does allocators are just way less likely to come in and buy it and so you get this sort of funny like let's like it it you know it honestly is a little bit funny to me because let's say you had these two uh these these two these two platforms ethereum and like a different version of ethereum where the fees were 100th the size uh and they had the equal equal amount of activity you might actually end up getting a lot of allocation to the first one instead of the second one because it like looks better on a on a basis even though moving forward you might actually see all that activity move over because of the fees but right now at least uh because all eyes are on ethereum uh because that's where the speculative money is because that's where the market participants are the they're able to charge those fees uh I do like that the New York analogy for ethereum it's like yes Manhattan's expensive but it's expensive for a reason because everybody's there and everybody that you want to be around is already there uh so you know I do think that that uh that is at least floating around the institutional circles is something that hey crypto now is actually Revenue Trader generating it's now real it's now a thing and the beauty of proof of stake is that all of those fees that are burned and all the fees that are generated by the way all the fees that are generated are now paid back to owners of the asset in Bitcoin it's very different all despite activity going through the roof all of those fees are paid not to the holders of Bitcoin but to an extractive third-party entity miners and so what you get is you just get a worse dynamic because the more activity that exists on bitcoin actually the more supply of Bitcoin is probably going to hit the market and it also deteriorates the user experience like binance just halted withdrawals briefly uh over the past 48 hours because the Bitcoin network was experiencing so much usage and traffic that just basic wallet transfer transactions were were delayed to a point that even binance was was like hey we need to hit the pause button here it's crazy to talk about so yeah it is it is what you mentioned about how the stakeholders of eth are aligned because they literally are staking it and earning the rewards um and processing the blocks constructing them and the fact that in Bitcoin you don't have that in the one you know on the one hand uh the security of the Bitcoin network is possibly more robust but on the other its usability as an L1 is you know there's a flaw there so you know I guess should we should we be worried about Bitcoin like Bitcoin has been the trade this year gbtc has outperformed Bitcoin but pretty much nothing else in in crypto land has uh with with the exception of a few smaller protocols should we be worried that miners minors have done pretty well and actually this is this is this is probably very bullish for Miners and I don't know if that's being reflected in price and I also don't know if like the street has figured this out yet and so he actually could see some like really good okay I just have an alert here Bitcoin transaction fees are exceeding 6.25 BTC block reward for the first time since 2017. just got sent out so uh you might have like whatever has been projected for minor revenues this quarter you might actually have that just be blown out of the water and like come earnings time for these guys you could get a pop if the street hasn't realized they'll they'll figure it out that's a great point I mean Marathon stock is up 173 this year it's it's crazy because I was referring more to like tokens and token looking things but yeah no you have you have a great point with these with these Miners and so I guess the question is um should we like should we be worried about Bitcoin dominance as a result of the fact that transactions have exploded on bitcoin and L1 that isn't necessarily built to work like ethereum and is deteriorating its ux like I I would think no I think I think eventually these you know ordinals and ordinals or Bitcoin nfts uh in the shortest possible explanation like I think this is going to die down and I think Bitcoin is going to remain a usable network but if it doesn't Look Out Below I'm I'm I'm I actually think the opposite I think that I what probably happens if I were to chart out a path is that we get Tech we got a tech solution to this we don't get a like die down solution to this there's no like a community of developers that's all in in agreement working on bitcoin the way that there is on each like their Bitcoin core devs but they're they're split into factions yeah but so I mean ordinals were developed these BRC 20s were developed like I think what's happening right now is you're seeing the or origin Sparks of an organic development Community for Bitcoin I think you're 100 right in that it doesn't exist today but I would bet that in a month in two months and three months like the number of people that are trying to figure out how to build on bitcoin probably two x's over the next month or two months based on this activity because like people flock to where you can make money at the end of the day and the reality is that you can now make money building on bitcoin so it might be very difficult but I think people are going to try and they might not it might not work but there's going to be an effort made because if you figure it out like I'm already seeing right now the so right now when you buy these BRC 20s it's all sorts of like it's kind of messed up right just for the listeners what what is a brc20 just for the the uninitiated and I'm gonna pretend that I know what I'm talking about and then just take notes on what you're saying so ordinals are effectively nfts on bitcoin a brc20 like has nothing to do with it in erc20 in a technical sense it's not like it's a token standard for building on bitcoin the same way that erc20 is like a standard token built on built on uh ethereum a brc20 is effectively still an nft but it's just like a bunch of the same nfts that are all fungible and so they're kind of quote unquote like tokens right so like when you you can go to brc-20 dot IO and you can see all the top brc20s it's just a play on words again and when you go and actually buy and sell these things you go to a Marketplace um forgetting the exact name of the of the website I'll pull it up in a second uh but you go you go you go in a Marketplace and it basically lists them out like in lots of a hundred or lots of a thousand at like different prices as you would see on open C like when you go on open scene you see a collection of all these different nfts well it's the same thing with these brc20s except that they're all the same they're just like varying amounts of them so it's like a hundred a thousand a ten thousand and one million of these Pepe BRC 20s and so there's no ex there's no like exchange for them yet it's more of a like listing of these nfts that represent different amounts of different amounts of the tokens but someone right now is working on building an amm for them hmm like I'm like they're like pushing you know commits commits to GitHub that's one I don't work like the developers working on their donut instead of exactly if you ask me are they gonna pull it off I have no idea like I don't even know if it's techn I'm not I'm not the most technical guy in the world I have absolutely no idea if it's possible to go actually build out on bitcoin I don't even know what it would look like if you did you get a whiteboard behind you so we know you're we know you're halfway Technical and serious yes as an investment professional yeah whiteboards mean you're very technically uh proficient I I have an HP Laser Jet that's that's my um claim to fame here that's how you guys legit I have a Cisco phone stratify whoa I know right oh nice I like I like regressed when back when back in the world like 20 years pick up this thing it's actually super useful by the way but I'm I'm so big on phone calls now uh what landlines yeah no just like phone calls in general I hate zooms I've grown to really hate them well Welcome to My Generation I I I totally sympathize and if you ever want to have a phone call like I'm right here I have a telephone waiting for you to dial it it's just like because when you're on zoom and then you have to like look them in the eye and pay attention and this is anyway this it's a whole thing get on the phone you go walk around I live on the beach you go walking up and down the beach used to get the same stuff done but you're like moving so much better anyway I completely lost my train of thought that doesn't matter I mean I think in every episode we have to spend at least three minutes talking about something unrelated to crypto and trading last time we talked about going outside and chill it chilling out for a bit now now we can just imagine Avi Feldman walking on the beach with that um that giant that that phone with the giant antenna the 1980s cell phone from Wall Street um Michael Douglas starred in that movie I don't know if you know who he is Avi but he's an actor um yeah so yeah I mean hop on the phone forget about Zoom for a little bit maybe maybe that's our our thousand X piece of Zen for this week yeah maybe we should start ending these podcasts with a piece of advice completely unsolicited we'll try our best to not make it terrible piece of advice yeah we're both wearing black t-shirts today so it probably shouldn't be fashion related we're mourning the the loss of the days when no one cared about ethereum and Bitcoin block space now it's a big frenzy in New York it would be very fashionable but this actually as a has some stuff on it we've got a casino Casino symbol the Sega it's a Sig shirt actually picked it up at some uh like they held some tournament in my college a long time ago uh uh while I was in college at my college when I was in college they held they held some sort of tournament for uh for trading like algorithmic trading like a bunch of the firms in Chicago I think I think that you clearly didn't otherwise he'd be working there no no one later and that's what America is all about one one later it was also like a really like it was a very like silly event um like it was it was just very unrealistic the way that the way that it was the way that it was put together but anyway that's what I'm gonna blame on the fact that it was uh that that I didn't win this is that so okay what the piece piece of advice if you ever if you ever fail just make sure you blame somebody else for it I I would rephrase that and sort of spin it back to crypto Trading um as follows I would say You're Gonna fail but just make sure that when you fail you don't die and that way you're still around to catch what hopefully is the next success I think crypto involves weathering some pretty difficult periods of time um financially and so if you can stay in a trade that staying power ultimately turns you into the contrarian who ends up uh reaping the asymmetric rewards after you know everybody else uh gets out of the way I don't understand why you would do this to me like I clearly I was like clearly joking with my piece of advice and you come in there with some like real advice to give to give to people to make me look bad Jonah are you kidding I mean we could go back to the the automatically generated transcript here obvi but I needed to I need to throw something in there even doing like 70 of the talking on this one we'll get you we'll get you talking on the next one I had a lot I want to hear your I want to hear what you have to say you you have a lot more crypto experience than most so it is ultra Ultra valuable for me for me as well well then the next time we're gonna have a very special guest on this podcast and a very interesting guest someone that you probably have never heard on podcast before because I don't think he's ever done a podcast before but he's one of the most successful traders in American history so I'll leave you with that again uh none of this is investment advice crypto is risky um but great having you on a thousand X and and thank you so much for joining we know your time is valuable and we we really appreciate you listening in very much so and I will reiterate none of this is investment advice thanks Jonah thanks Avi until next week

the fact is with Solana that at this point it's like so tightly controlled by people that really deeply believe in it that it is kind of priced for failure what I'm saying is like there's like zero there's zero fast money in this thing right now yep uh and so any I think any hint of Rejuvenation from Solana probably skyrockets this thing um I think it would get one big game drops or one yeah there's there's just no there's no fast money in it oh hello hello you've got uh Avi and Joni here I want to welcome welcome you guys back to the now real inaugural first episode second episode of thousand x uh podcasts we took a bit of a Hiatus for a few months there for for a variety for a variety of reasons but you know we just wanted to make sure that we could bring you this content consistently and you know via consistent platform that you guys can come to and expect that we're going to be regular with our with our talks and appearances so that they've got a few months to just figure out what that would look like so we'll be coming to you for about 45 minutes to an hour every two weeks talking about our takes on the market and I'm super excited about it you know I think most of the people that pull up this podcast at least for the you know for the for the first one probably know us from uh you know either either Twitter or from a previous podcast or other other podcast experiences so I won't waste too much time on on introductions and you know your time is valuable so we can we can uh we can hop right in I'm excited too Avi uh glad to be doing this I mean episode zero was it was a good chance to to Workshop how we're gonna how we're gonna do this podcast and since then it's been a pretty busy Market I mean we were bullish um we we were right the price of crypto doubled pretty much over the course of our little Hiatus but now it's off 10 12 in what looks like kind of a a scary retracement a lot of people in the market are asking themselves hey is this just a return to 27 28k that that range that we had since the banking crisis or is this the beginning of a fresh downtrend that's gonna you know wipe out a lot of wealth um I tend to think the former um I think that people often get pretty worked up about you know regulatory uh headwinds or this or that fire sale going on as a result of you know perceived liquidations Mount Cox others what have you um I think most of that is frankly priced in I think people often ignore the the second derivative of the information like Hayes is the regulatory climate going to get worse or or less bad than from here uh from here can it even get any worse than this um I you know I tend to be more of an optimist that's my bias I think the regulatory climate will become less restrictive rather than more and I think the market is more than robust enough to absorb the upcoming spat of liquidations so short-term chop possibly bit of amplitude not not much to to do in the near term but medium to long term remain pretty bullish what do you think yeah uh it's it's tough and I'll give you the three things I'm thinking about right now the first is on the way up it was very hard for me um maybe less less hard for you to identify the type of the type of buyer that was buying uh post 28k post 29k like who are who are the guys that are coming in and really really hammering it I think from 20K to 25 to 26 a lot of the buyers based on the way that the market market was trading based on your average order sizes that you were that you were seeing go through based on the way that CME open interest was trading and versus uh open interest on finance and all these and all these other platforms you could make the argument that you know it was the high net with individuals it was large macro funds it was potentially we brought up Hong Kong and Dubai really coming into this coming into this market and then also people that were betting on the digital gold narrative you know gold 2.0 gold is ripping as well gold went you know cold went up 10 15 uh from from the uh bottom of the bottom of the banking crisis and I think a lot of those buyers um what I'd say is that they dissipated around 28k uh you just didn't see that type of activity in in the market and what we were betting on at that point was retail coming coming in and you know pushing it higher maybe pushing it to 33 35 you get above 30 and maybe retail Mania comes back in uh and so what actually ended up happening is I think a lot of people including you know ourselves were positioned a little early for maybe a rotation for Bitcoin to all coins uh you know expecting expecting that retail would come in and effectively what happened is that that didn't materialize um so the question that I have so the first part is okay well who who are the buyers on the way up we kind of knew until 28k you bet on retail coming in post 28k pushing it pushing it to 30 they managed to do a little bit didn't didn't manage to go further it didn't extend to all coins there wasn't retail on their for all coins so now we're coming back on the way down and the second part of this is okay well we know who the first set of buyers were and we know that retail didn't really appear and in the second how do you know that how do you know that reads like what do you what do you look at what should listeners look at to see like hey is retail starting to to fomo into this asset so I I think the unfortunate so for for me a lot of that is a little bit hindsight it's saying okay well if I look back on it the biggest alt moves from the large caps are 15 20 percent uh there wasn't a ton of rotation out of Bitcoin into in into into into all coins uh there didn't seem to be a massive or a large increase in volumes on derivative products on on binance or okx or hobby uh and so in hindsight what I'm saying is that I didn't see retail come in in a large way and so now we have a situation bitcoin's trading at 27.5 at this current at this current at this current level and my question is okay if it's if retail is probably not going to buy the dip because they didn't buy the breakout and Retail tends to buy breakouts more than they buy dips then you have to bet that the first set of buyers are going to come back in the market and drive this up so you know your your high net worth individuals your people betting on gold but gold is now trading poorly and equities are trading okay and actually there's been a decoupling uh of Bitcoin Bitcoin from equities in the wrong direction whereas before there's a decoupling in the right direction and so my view is that the type of buyer that propelled us up is likely no longer present and Bitcoin has been trading very it trades in a very Trend heavy fashion right we Trend it all the way from 20K to 30k we've seemingly broke the trend now and so if I were to you know go to my head say where's Bitcoin going to be in a month probably 24K in my opinion because now that's not a massive move for Bitcoin I mean okay I'm I'm sitting here saying hey put a gun in my head that's a 60 chance you get 24K 40 chance you get 30. but what that means to me is that hey I probably don't want to be in all coins yeah I probably I probably want to hold a reasonable a reasonable amount of cash and I want to be cautious uh with with my buy because I think that these guys that allocated originally the high net worth side is going to look for Value levels and I don't necessarily think that 27 5 or 27k is that value level yeah it's kind of just that post banking crisis range it's not really something where you say wow this is this is a real generational buying opportunity 24K I think you'd attract some people certainly the people who are saying hey maybe I'm a little bit too late should I buy when it was trading 30k at this point though you know I have a bit of a tin foil hat thesis about who the mystery crypto buyer was Bitcoin buyer really my my sort of conspiracy theory here is that um as part of the D dollarization narrative de-dollarization is a cool word but just abstracting in a way for a second what's really going on that you have governments like China that hold 10 trillion US dollars worth of U.S dollar denominated Securities and cash and cash equivalents and they're looking at what happened last year with the Ukraine war and what the U.S did to you know the treasury effectively did to Russia's U.S dollar denominated assets which is you know drumroll they took them um and thinking to themselves hey maybe we should let a little bit of this U.S dollar denominated exposure roll off and reinvest it into other things you know you can see that happening in gold gold markets the you know Chinese Central Bank will publish on a delayed basis you don't know if the data is spot on or not but um you know they publish their Holdings and they you know those Holdings are going up they're not staying you know static so I think that if central banks are accumulating non-dollar denominated Bearer assets like gold and reducing their US dollar denominated Holdings they're probably doing something similar with crypto a bearer asset an alternative investment and that was sort of my you know my hunch especially when Bitcoin would start to outperform during the Asia session not during you know North American Stock Exchange hours over the course of this sort of last leg up from 28 to 30k now like you said it's absent and usually what happens when you have a big buyer in the market an elephant in the room and prices don't seem to reflect fundamental reality because the flows are what Drive the prices usually one of two things happens what definitely doesn't happen is equilibrium what can happen is that that elephant in the room is just bigger than everybody expects and the market takes off or the elephant you know just kind of gets sleepy and walks back out in the jungle and falls asleep and then prices uh you know kind of come back off and I think the latter of those two is what what just happened um I don't know is that crazy no I don't think I don't think it's crazy I remember I remember us talking about this offline um where we were looking at the uh at the balance sheets of uh we looked at China and India and there's been a lot of there's been a lot of gold accumulation I don't think it's insane to think that uh you know I don't necessarily know if I'd go so far as to say that governments themselves are buying but it's possible that government-funded funded vehicles are buying right yeah uh you know maybe I threw through a couple of through a couple of layers they they might be allocating but what I think is absolutely true is that the banking crisis caused a lot of uh people in Silicon Valley to buy uh Bitcoin it caused a lot of high net worth individuals uh to buy I think that um it also reinvigorated the narrative for People for People overseas and I also think that uh not necessarily overlooked because I think it was reported on enough but the opening of Hong Kong to crypto is very is very important uh you know in June they're going to be allowing uh retail trading in in Hong Kong and this this is anecdotal which probably led to reasonable amounts of buying from Hong Kong because as people see hey I can go access crypto again I can go buy crypto again and maybe you um I can actually go front run the smaller tickets the retail once once this uh once it's open up to them uh and then you look at you know what was happening what was happening in Russia with the foreign with the foreign reserves being being frozen uh you know that that's all that's always in the back your mind um especially as things heat up between the between the US and China so I think there's just a little bit of Confluence for why you might get allocation allocation to crypto and it did it did have to come it did have to come from somewhere um I do also think that CZ buying probably helped a bit that's uh I don't know anything about that but that's an interesting Theory I mean at this point like I agree with you that Hong Kong is super relevant I think that it's a good reminder to all of us and you know just any Market that you can't like unless the G20 Nations get together and just ban this stuff um it's it's a global market uh one government even one as powerful as as you know the United States government can't necessarily uh control this Market uh effectively unilaterally um you know when China banned crypto it was It was obviously negative for crypto a few years ago but the US really stepped up and and you know things took off from there now you see kind of a you know the pendulum swinging back the other way so it is interesting that Hong Kong's deregulating right as the US is you know sort of bolstering its regulatory efforts uh I mean it's it's in my opinion you know I don't want to speak too strongly in case uh you know people people are listening too closely to us we get we get too big but I think it's a massive strategic mistake for the US to make right now and I think everybody else is actually very excited about I mean even the UK is excited about it and there's a lot of uh they're they're actually one one thing that's going to be very interesting is that our our internal opinion is that there's probably some resolution either positive or negative to the Ripple lawsuit in the next two to three months or there's some decision Point that's going to occur that's going to give the market a lot of information about how the case is going to go and the what that means is that on that headline if it's positive you probably want to buy as much not just Ripple but you probably want to buy as many alt coins as you possibly can especially the ones that have been deemed high risk Securities D5 probably does very well on that day if it's negative right continue holding no altcoins because you right now you probably shouldn't be holding that many anyway that is that is actually an interesting point you bring up um crypto is one of those markets that's nascent enough where you still have a bit of time to react to news um you know in Trad Phi if OPEC comes out with a decision to cut like if you're trying to click click Buy on the nymex uh you're just too late right meanwhile you you seem to have an amazing track record of reacting to these things and usually what sort of time frames do you see them you know play out over like for example if there were a decision in that lawsuit or if there were you know perhaps some sort of perhaps some sort of uh guidance that came out of Washington maybe it'd be too late to trade xrp but how would you think about rolling risk into you know out the curb into Alt yeah I I think about it really is uh it's it's just two two uh two axes it's just and it's time is time by the way is not really one of them it's probably it's price movement and relevance of news um you know and price movement is generally correlated with Thai but not always sometimes you get some some pretty simply slow reactions I think that generally the more complicated the news the more uh you know like the the more complicated the news the more Edge there is so for example with a ripple lawsuit if the lawsuit is a ripple has settled uh for a fine uh and that's and that's that's the headline that comes out that actually doesn't really tell you that much you need to figure out well what ex what exactly what exactly happened did they did they say did they not admit guilt and they just settled did they say hey it was a security at the time of issuance and now it's not a security that they say hey it's a security at a time of issuance it's now security we're going to pay this fine and then we're gonna shut down shut down next right so it's like you you kind of have to understand you know like what is good for the market and what is and and what and what is bad for the market obviously that comes out in the docket it might not appear directly in the blue in the Bloomberg headline you might actually have to open the PDF and go and go and go read through it um but I've noticed a lot in crypto and this is generally become better and better over time just as any Market would things take a while to be digested by the market uh and it all it also you know some some things tend to tend to happen that uh are are inefficient so you know one one example of this is the Doge moves basically every single Doge move that has happened because of an Elon Musk tweet has reverted in 48 hours to 72 like they hit rate on that trade is so insanely high that if you short if you like sell Doge 45 minutes to an hour after an Elon tweet about Doge like your hit rate on that is like 90 percent right and so you still use you can actually you can actually actually play it play play it play it from both from both sides I mean I remember um you know one uh one one example of this was if I remember correctly like a few months ago when the market was ripping sand had announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia to invest uh you know in in in a in them or in one of the games I'm forgetting the the exact details of the news here but uh it on the news it went up you know like six or seven percent but it was on a day where Bitcoin and etherific and so when we saw that we were actually late to the news it was up six seven percent but on a day when the market is ripping that aggressively and the theme of the moment and the animal spirits of the moment were all centered around Dubai it was centered around Middle Eastern money it's like okay well that's actually probably a good still a good trade because we were Within I'm gonna say like five five six percent getting their stats of the benchmarks yeah it's not not it's spitting distance of the benchwise it's not that much so you buy the ended up to date 20 right and then you then you you you clipped that um so if that had happened in a market where Bitcoin was up where Bitcoin was down a percent I'm probably not taking that trade so you also have to contextualize it within okay well what's happening in the rest of the market how many like how many people are there staring at this stuff how much money is there to to move around I'd say that now this this Market is a market where you need to be very careful with those types of Trades just because of what we were talking about earlier this doesn't seem to be a lot of trading interest yeah I mean retail retail interest is kind of what you have to monitor I mean back in the day there was the coinbase premium you you know if coinbase traded over a bunch of other exchanges you knew that it was retail buying maybe one day we'll get the Hong Kong premium but um you know maybe maybe listeners should just try and develop some Metric for uh retail driven strength to to use as kind of a barometer for hey should I should I be trying to do these you know riskier should I dip my toes into riskier all coin trades or should I just stick to bitcoin and eat stay disciplined stay patient and you know interestingly to your point Abby like I guess we had you know in retrospect the best opportunity of the year would have been one that I was a little bit too scared to capitalize on in any form of reasonable size which was the uh the dip buy during the banking crisis when unchain activity was going crazy people were swapping you know Stables into Bitcoin and eighth because Bitcoin and eighth seemed Stabler than the stable coins and um you know there was clearly this sort of shift in the Paradigm from hey this is a correlated macro asset to hey this is you know this this crypto asset thing might actually be fulfilling its promise as a you know a banking system alternative and on that note you know people who saw that coming would have had a real opportunity in the benchmarks that didn't play out too quickly to actually react to and so I think we might have another one of these types of opportunities coming down the pike possibly as the debt ceiling approaches and I know crypto people aren't necessarily as focused on this as you know if you're a treasury's Trader or or you know just a you know more of a Trad five participant but what this one seems kind of real like it's like what am I seeing on that side Jonah like what are you what are you seeing with the debt ceiling that worries you well okay so in 2011 the United States of America got downgraded from AAA uh not because of an inability to pay but because of in potential unwillingness to pay that was a big deal I mean gold that was the beginning of a 20 or 30 gold rally I forget exactly how much but it was a big one um and a lot of markets tanked a lot of risk markets gold went up um now I guess the government technically shut down in December of two thousand 19 I want to say for 25 or 30 days and they kept paying back on they kept paying back their debt they were servicing their coupon payments they were repaying principal of T bills um they just shut down government services and basically they subordinated employees of the government and their salaries to servicing their debt they put the debt holders first now we've got a situation where the political this was over the the Donald Trump uh wall thing now I think the vitriol is just as high if not higher than then and unlike then interest rates weren't you know aren't zero anymore so you have Mom and Pop holding money market funds trying to earn four or five percent you have people holding t-bills you know billions and billions of dollars worth of short-term Securities roll off every month so if the government were actually to default if there were if there were to be a standoff in Congress that results in no resolution whatsoever and the government Yellen is already using Extraordinary Measures to quote her to just pay back what the government owes right now if that ends during What's called the the X date um sometime in the next month or two with no resolution then you end up with an unprecedented event in financial history whereby the supposed risk-free rate is no longer risk-free the United States government will say hey we owe you you know hey hey Mr you know dentist we owe you a hundred grand sorry we don't have that for you right now we got you though like wait a week or two until we figure this out in Congress then I think what do you think gold could do or Bitcoin could do in a scenario like that it doesn't uh it doesn't look that many I mean maybe if there's not paying attention to the right place but it doesn't seem like that many people are worried about this what what is it do you have the timelines mapped out in your head when you think this would become a real issue um the basically what's going on right now is a t-bill expiring in May yields three and change percent 3.3 3.4 a t-bill expiring in June yields four and a half to four point eight percent so you've got 150 basis points of differential in you know just yield for government securities with a one-month differential so that tells you pretty much all you need to know about um trepidation around the date where the United States might potentially default it was supposed to be late June early July now they've rolled that forward because supposedly tax receipts were underwhelming but I can't even believe that they're discussing this and you know it's in every major newspaper on the front page but um markets aren't necessarily getting roiled yet because I think we've been through a few of these that have resolved in an okay fashion yeah I mean I think I I think I think in that scenario it'd be interesting to like get an exact look at the Historical analog of uh of what gold did during that time but I 30 percent both times it was real that's big okay you you okay you confirmed that okay nice um yeah I I bet that Bitcoin would do quite well in that scenario me too yeah I I and and if you look at that if you look at the correlations between BTC and gold and then BTC and uh um uh equities it's it's basically flipped over the last or over the last month I mean now is a lot more correlated with gold than it is than than ones with Equity so I think that if that causes gold trip then Bitcoin rips I think um it would probably catalyze a decent amount of of high net worth buying although I do think that the one the one thing that I do worry about with Bitcoin is just and this has been talked about a decent amount but I think it's important to talk about a little bit more is the supply Side Story is still quite large you have the government sales at Bitcoin and you have the maclock sales of of Bitcoin that are that are that are coming through so my my take on that is that it would be a similar to what happened before banking crisis where I think what ended up happening is it it just pushed up the low of Bitcoin so I think a lot of new holders came in because they were worried about the banking crisis and those holders some percentage of them are going to be converted to long-term holders of this asset and are going to stick in this asset for a while uh but that doesn't necessarily mean this thing goes up in a straight line so I I would bet that something similar happens like you probably get a plus 15 plus 20 move from Bitcoin and then a retracement to higher than where it was before maybe maybe a 20 to 30 move depending on how on how serious it is and now and how much and how much gold moves and then you get and then you get some sort of retracement I think the story of Bitcoin has always been it really Rockets hard when retail gets involved um and so my view is that for the next uh you know month or two potentially three to four months we're probably just going to be trading sideways to to lower unless we get like a massive Catalyst like this so I view I guess what I'm what I'm trying to say is I wouldn't view this as a long-term Catalyst to buoy the price of Bitcoin to 40K I would view it as an opportunity to trade it the similar to what the banking crisis was with an additional benefit of it making Bitcoin better long term because it just converts more holders I think you have a really good perspective on that too I think you've made a career for yourself uh not just being long for you know the big upswings but also being Nimble and getting in and out as appropriate um I tend to I know that my bias is a little bit more to try and just focus on the long term because that's a framework that you can cling to when things are going badly when you're staring at a bunch of red numbers um you know but it is important for for everyone listeners us included to just think a little bit more critically about how to lighten up ahead of uh had a potential problems and re-add when you know things look scary but actually they're they're you know constructive so I guess to that point um you know our podcast is called a thousand X there is some alt buying out there Pepe just thousand x what what the heck happened there that's a that's a wild one dude I mean if I if I knew if I knew what was that what was happening there I've been all on Pepe did please you did you did you buy any no I mean I just saw it and I was like this thing what it was too late it was it was alive for like three days and then Pepe the the Frog was worth 125 million dollars yeah dude I mean like I feel I feel like these things I actually think um so if I if I were to make a bat Jonah I would bet and this is not Financial advice by any means so please nobody take this as Financial advice but I would bet that Pepe becomes the Sheba of next cycle like it just it probably just does something so absurd that you hate yourself for not owning any would be my guess um but I do think like crypto just tends to do this from time to time where it'll find one asset it'll just absolutely Pile in that asset and then people probably forget about it for like 12 months and then suddenly like mid bull cycle when uh when retail interest comes back or things like pulls like another like 50x would be my guess as to what as to what it does um maybe it's down like 90 first and then it goes up 100x but it's it's funny like I there is I think uh when we talk about retail it's really about new money like there's no new money in like I would bet if we ran the numbers on the owners of Pepe the vast majority of them would be people that were pretty deep into crypto already yeah you know whereas when you look at something like Sheba a lot of people that were buying Sheba during the crazy Bull Run that was like the first token that they bought those that's like they'd only they'd like been on Tick Tock and they'd heard about Sheba and they watched a tutorial to get on uniswap and then they bought some eth and then they sent it over and then they bought Sheba and like the whole reason for buying eth was to buy Sheba and there was like this non-trivial amount of new money in the door um that got us that and I think Pepe is just an extension of people in crypto getting bored like I I would I would bet and maybe maybe we could run the numbers and I'll I'll tweet something out about this once uh once once once we take uh once we take a look at it um and release the cast as to whether we I confirmed my theory or not um but but my bet would it's just a bunch of defy insiders uh that are so you think basically you think people are getting into these meme coins that like the Gateway the Gateway is Bitcoin and Eve they're not like just lifting Pepe with Fiat they're they're just watching value around that was already in the ecosystem that would be that would be my guess for now with that being said I just think The Branding is so hilarious that it probably does pull like a crazy move in the Bull Run I think so I mean again not investment advice none of this is investment advice but I you're not wrong and it's crazy like what it highlights is that like actual wealth got created on that somehow and I think what this highlights is that in crypto you have this fantastic dichotomy between you know Bitcoin geopolitically relevant keeping central banks honest like not even a dark horse for next Global Reserve currency type arguments flying around eth World computer like fantastic technology scaling Solutions of remarkable complexity and then on the other end of the spectrum you have this right and it you know you could say this is bad or less worthwhile or whatever air quotes but you could also say hey maybe you know there is a casino element to certain pockets of crypto or an identity element or you know a community element that that actually has value that traditional Finance just completely ignores like penny stocks don't take take into account so I don't know I think it's an interesting phenomenon to keep tabs on even if you're trying to pretend to be a serious professional uh or or are one yeah you need you need to because I think also like that I mean for for better for worse a big portion of the uh like product experience of crypto is the ability to gamble and the ability to to bet to bet on these things so I mean if Pepe does if like a bunch of meme coins rip really hard then that's actually good for youth if they're built if they're built on eth right a bunch of coins on Solana rip really hard that's that's good that's good that's good for Solana um one thing that has been I think pretty striking over the last uh six months especially post FTX is that effectively every other L1 has just died in terms of activity and in terms of Interest relative to Ethan and l2s built on top of ether like really feels like there's it's um you have to be a pretty massive contrarian at this point to bet on the app chain thesis like uh to bet on a thing like polka dot or to bid on a thing like uh like Cosmos um and how would you I would do elevator pitch the app chain thesis like what is it for people who don't know yeah the the way that it's it's really it's really about uh Native Native interoperability and customizable blockchains right so like if you have if you have an L2 on eth the L2 on eth is effectively just another layer to build a bunch of applications with a bunch of applications still have to share that block space and there's generally a set format to the data that exists on that on that L2 right so every every app has to interact with the same the same programming layer of that of that L2 whereas an app chain it's a little bit more customizable so you can just have one chain per app customize that chain so for example if you have a uh trading platform like a GMX that exists on an app chain then maybe what you want to do is you want to make sure that when you order transactions that go through on that chain uh you get preference for liquidation transactions so that you have a lesser chance of getting of getting bankrupt on that on that train and then if you're uh exchange without you know that that isn't like a GMX you're like a unit swap then you're built on a chain that doesn't have that built in because there's kind of no reason for that to be to to be built in so it introduces a little bit more customizability and then you have um you know native interoperability between the two I think uh like a main issue with options is one that UI ux that really sucks right now it's just impossible to use interoper building doesn't really exist on on a great level and also it's a lot it's more complicated obviously to build out your own custom chains and the dev Community just like hasn't really hasn't really gravitated there and obviously you get a lot more security without with l2s and uh with with Heath right now but I mean I remember you know even two years ago people people really not really bullish on the on the app chain thesis and maybe you know my maybe my information's information is outdated here but at least at a high level it just seems like people people aren't really interested in that anymore so that's um an area that maybe we have to maybe we have to spend some more I always like being contrarian and uh and yeah I mean it is is definitely the contrarian moment to bet on alt l1's app chains uh basically scaling scaling Solutions or scared scale to L ones that aren't really in Vogue right now and I think I guess what happened during this this most recent consolidation cycle slash bear Market is that I guess the market just kind of asked who cares like does anyone you guys have built all these really fast chains but is there even demand for eth right now um and like do we need all this block space uh do we need to invest time and effort building applications on top of these alternative blockchains when you know eth works just fine for the rudimentary things that we want to put on there and you know maybe that was a valid thesis but maybe the pendulum will swing the other way uh in in the next six months um heart hard to bet on though very hard to bet on especially given the decimation in Holtz I guess what would you look for as a leading indicator if you want to start buying near polka dot Solana one of those I think I look for just like right real real activity starting up although Solana Salon is kind of an interesting one because I think Salon is priced for um I don't want to say it's like price does a dead asset because it still is valuable but the fact is with Solana that at this point it's like so tightly controlled by people that really deeply believe in it that it is kind of priced for failure what I'm saying is like there's like zero there's zero fast money in this thing right now yeah uh and so any I think any hint of Rejuvenation from Solana probably skyrockets this thing um I think it would take one big game drops or one yeah there's there's just no there's no fast money in it there's just like no fast money there are people like Chris bernicki who sit around on uh on on Twitter and you know say hey Salon is a actually pretty good pretty pretty great asset if you like multi-coin um I think the only the only thing that you'd have to really worry about with Solana is the for selling from FTX um if like that that's actually kind of an interesting NPC unlocks and and yeah well Salon is mostly unlocked so it's uh you know so it's like maybe like redemptions for multi-coin but um you have uh yeah like but with FTX it's probably gonna take a year or so to actually start selling as far as we enter as far as we understand it um I'll go double check with my lawyers and follow that up with the correction if I'm wrong but I'm that that's that's the latest information that we have it's gonna it's gonna take a while uh to actually actually start selling uh selling these assets so uh you know I think for at least a short term not not particularly worried about that um so yeah I mean it's it's it's it's it's definitely interesting I mean near is like I have no idea what's going on with that thing man it's like hard to follow these these things sort of died like a terrible death in my opinion I don't understand like this was this was like the greatest thing since sliced bread for a while and then it just kind of faded into the backdrop fairly quickly I you know I go back and forth on alt L ones on the one hand I think hey you know like like Abby says time to be a contrarian they've been beaten up to a degree that eth just hasn't and I do you know I am bullish for I do think there will be another bull cycle so put on a survivable amount of this stuff and just hold on you know and put your eggs in a few different baskets the other side of me just wonders like have the existing offerings of l1s like have have their reasons to exist when completely disproven have they have they Fallen flat on their promises like Solana got taken out by a walking app like that was too much for Solana this like performant vertically integrated chain to handle um near you know it's supposed to be this unbelievable user experience and then no one just showed up to the party at all I like I don't understand so again it's kind of like thirty thousand dollar Bitcoin didn't understand that that doesn't feel like a stable equilibrium these things are either going to go up a lot or down a lot but they're certainly not just going to kind of float around in a correlated way with Heath and trade one to one yeah I I agree I I think the the the the the the issue is that like all activity has just migrated away and so these things are floating around with these pretty inflated valuations and are trying to I think work hard on the BD standpoint I think what it what it takes for these things to really take off at this point is it seems like it they've lost the organic War what do I mean by that it seems like they've lost the ability to organically attract developers in crypto to go build on their platforms and go organically attract retail so it's like these guys are gonna have to just like win big uh accounts for example Amazon nft platform I don't know who they're built on but whoever they're built on unless it's on a custom chain probably does very well right uh so I think it's things like that like what if snap Snapchat decides to go launch a chain and they go partner partner with one of the one of the top L ones that isn't ethereum well that probably brings a lot of users to that chain so what I'm saying is that these the the winners of the L1 are probably not going to be uh from massive organic growth at this point as far as I see it it's probably going to be from a top a top-down heavy approach just because the organ is Dev growth yeah it's just going to be Biz Dev because the organic growth is just totally all on Ethan and l2s and Biz Dev is harder when there is a massive regulatory headwind that kind of targets your gateways your on-ramps and off-ramps between Fiat and crypto definitely makes it scarier for web 2 companies to to dabble so how's your day yeah it's uh it's been nice um traded some crypto uh let's go here let me ask you a question I actually didn't I didn't look at the markets a lot to that I mean I always look at the markets like two to three hours a day um you know that was that was today but um I I actually did manage to take some time off this weekend and a little bit this evening this is avi's birthday I'm an old man I'm an old man now a few more of those and you'll catch up with me um it's pretty exciting I hope I never catch up with you Jonah I'm joking um so yeah basically I think it's good to take a little break from Market sometimes like crypto is just too much like at least oil would give me my weekends this is non-stop so you kind of have to self-impose a little bit of uh a little bit of a break otherwise you know lose your mind right I I agree I think it crypto's also one of those things that just totally trashes your dopamine right because you're the library well you're just constantly getting dopamine from something you're either earthing you're either getting dopamine from prices doing what you want them to do or you're feeling pain from them not doing what you want them to do and then you're also constantly getting pain do you're constantly on Twitter or you're constantly talking to somebody about it it's just like this overwhelming presence in your life that I think it can make it hard to step back out and look at the big picture unless you force yourself to go take those breaks yeah totally even even even 24 hours is enough in my experience you know just like sit there with your own thoughts for 10 15 minutes take a log and that go outside because you know how many people I know that just don't do that I just don't give themselves any silence at all like at any point during the day they're listening to to music or they're looking at trading view or they're on telegram or they're on Twitter it's like you know anyway this is not a self-help podcast so maybe it should be I mean the thing about it is like in traditional Finance um you know 15 16 years ago like cell phones were not a constant Interruption there was no slack Bloomberg messaging was pretty much the most real-time form of markets communication markets had hours like things were things were kind of old-fashioned in a way and now they um there is this non-stop barrage of information dopamine or lack thereof and I don't know I guess I guess in the times where it's tempting to click around and do stuff buy some meme coin because you're bored um ultimately uh if if I find myself getting too caught up in that little Vortex of um Discord I I feel like it's it's time to step back and just cling to a medium or long-term thesis and try to do less you know at least that's how I end up avoiding problems yeah I think that's I I think that's actually a very very fair fair approach on the market I also know you've been uh you ever every now and then you do keep Shabbat yep that's right I heard you do the same every now and then every now already told me um man so what else uh what else is going on in the in in the markets today I think you've got a little bit of like if you're in crypto your long-term thesis has to be that there's some kind of Financial relevance to this asset that's going to exceed just gambling right and I think that when you see things like the 10.2 or 10.1 inflation print in the UK you see what's going on in Argentina or Lebanon um you know it's those are those are little tidbits from macro reminding you why you're why you're bought into this um if you did or why you might kind of consider buying it I think there are two things that have really and you know um the the second one's a little a little bit more a little bit more new but the first part is yeah on the on the monetary side there's been just a tremendous amount of strife over the last year or two in in the macro worlds and play in places that you mentioned and that really brings to lightweight Bitcoin is so valuable uh I think on the second Point there's the rise of AI and all these deep fakes these like crazy I don't know if you saw the the song that was like produced by AI that was uh that was a Drake a drake copy sounded sounded exactly like him they're gonna be so they're going to be so much insane uh you know content out there that you're just not gonna know if it's real or not and that verification that like true verification of uh you know are you a real human or not is this a Content that is produced by a real human is that is that is Ron DeSantis actually saying that or did he was it was he faked it was true anyway I'm not getting but um you get you you get you get what I'm saying right it's and that I actually think can be solved for in some ways in some ways by by crypto right um just you know any any time you go hey prove prove that you produce this video do it the same way that you prove that you own an address with a you know with a with a digital signature that's a fantastic point there is an immutability I mean obviously I'm sure it will will find a day when Auto GPT starts launching random blockchains thousands per hour but I mean in terms of the chains that that have relevance today they are immutable you can prove that something happened with a time stamp and a settlement that's a great Point Abby so I think those those are the like over overarching themes to you know maybe uh maybe wrap up with is uh those are the two most interesting things that I'm seeing right now in the in in in the crypto world and um to recap on uh to recap on markets just uh just just things happen I mean things haven't really changed in the last 45 minutes since recorded but I do uh you know if you put you put a gun to my head I think Bitcoins I think bitcoin's 24K in the next month go under your head Jonah 24 or 30. 24. okay we're on the same page not investment advice of course none of this is cryptos risky but what a you know what a sobering thought from a long-term crypto bull um you know just another reminder to sort of stay safe out there and be disciplined not go crazy with risk tell our listeners uh stay safe and uh have a good uh have a good day evening night enjoy yourself wherever you are out there thanks for listening

instead of looking at all the same stuff that other people are looking at try to go find the new stuff that's out there the stuff that's overlooked right and put in the work the thing that's beautiful about this Market environment absolutely beautiful is that we currently have in my opinion a lazy Trader problem where people aren't putting in the work hey guys uh welcome to the Thousand X podcast with you've got me Avi and Jonah van Berg here it's funny normally I'm uh I'm a guest on podcast and this is actually the first time that I've a lot of podcasters or start started started a podcast and you know I'm happy to have I'm happy to have Jonah here as my you know as my partner in this I think it's been a it's been a fun it's been a fun ride met Jonah almost almost a year ago now uh and you know consider him one of the one of the smartest guys in uh in in the space and we we chat pretty pretty regularly about what's going on what's going on in the markets and we realized that it'd be fun to do this in a public format where we go around we hash we hash our ideas we talk about what we're seeing in the markets and we discuss what we're seeing day to day as two professional Traders you know we I love consuming content on podcasts I love listening to to smart people talk about smart things I don't know if that's going to be this podcast but we'll I guess we'll find out and one of the things that I felt I was I was missing was a perspective from people that are in the markets day to day right so you know I I'm the head of digital assets trading at golden tree which is a 50 billion dollar asset manager we just recently spun out a spun out a crypto desk and we've got a team of 10 people working on working on digital assets right now trading we have a look you know we we have we participate in liquids we participate inventure we sort of do everything under the sun which I guess is a little bit unexpected for for traditional fun but I'm in the markets every day one trading view with you guys every day I'm checking nanson with you guys every day and so we're you know we're we're in the markets uh looking at the data and Jonah Jonah does the same you know that's you know he's a he's ahead of trading over at over at Cumberland right now and I don't want to speak too much for him but the the bottom line is we wanted to start something where two practitioners could get together every couple weeks and just talk about what they're seeing in the markets and hopefully generate some interesting content for you guys the listeners out there from people that are doing this professionally we're not that many professional crypto investors crypto Traders out there so you know hopefully hopefully we'll have some great discussions and we're happy to have you along for the ride definitely I mean couldn't be more thrilled to be doing this with you Avi um you know you're obviously well known in crypto circles I'm more of a newcomer but I appreciate you welcoming me into the fold here um you know I gotta say uh as head of trading at Cumberland it's been it's been a pretty wild ride over the last year crypto has gone from you know let's call it Euphoria at the beginning of the year to now I don't know whether you want to call it despair or you know absolute panic but um this is uh this is a wild asset class but it's an important one the geopolitical relevance of of crypto is on the rise and you know one of the Theses that Avi and I had when we were talking about starting this thing was like hey internet money web 3 Bitcoin all of this stuff like it's you know never before in history his early stage technology been so liquid and transparent so if you're gonna spin up a web 3 company if you're going to trade Bitcoin if you're gonna just get involved in uh the digital world and it's native assets you gotta understand these markets and so uh you know normally tech people uh and Market practitioners aren't really kind of on the same page and we're trying to kind of bring everybody to the table to talk about this stuff it's it's more important than ever trillions of dollars of value are getting kind of washed around in these markets and and you know we think that crypto podcasting it's a great way to learn about the space but in general um what we've heard so far is is mostly you know crypto podcasters tend to be journalists so nothing against them they do great journalism but there aren't really a lot of Traders out there podcasting and talking to other Traders and you know giving listeners the flavor of what goes on on trading floors you know I'm uh avi's uh you know a young Thundercat a superstar in the crypto space I'm I'm more of an older guy um I'm about 10 years older than him uh I before this I was an oil Trader come from a Trad five background I was a partner at vital uh it's a big fossil fuel Trading Company the biggest um and I I guess I joined crypto because I found it so fascinating and it started to look familiar uh a bit like a commodity would for a number of reasons that we can get into on the podcast but I have more of a Trad five background so um ultimately hopefully Avi and I can kind of unpack this this really confusing world with a balanced perspective where we're not going to come in and you know have this I guess you get you get a pretty binary perspective in the space you get people who say crypto is a scam it's all [ __ ] it's going to zero there's a lot of that out there and then on the other end of the spectrum you have these sort of crypto euphoric people who interpret every everything that hits the spaces Giga bullish and we want to provide you guys the balance perspective try to interpret things in a reasonable way and help educate people about what we believe to be a pretty important movement so yeah looking forward to it Avi you really you really aged yourself there with the ThunderCats reference I had no idea what that was so I looked it up for for those of you that don't know a Thundercats was apparently a show that aired from 1985 to 1989 it was in 2D Millennial stuff there's in two wow I can't imagine watching a 2d show about Thundercats well I I'll take I'll take it as a compliment Jonah you should man you're a Thundercat so with with all with all the with all with all the intro out of the way how you feeling about the markets today uh well all right so it's a good question I think we're in for a lot of volatility volumes are in the toilet right now if you look at March as a reference point for just Crypt had the number of dollars of crypto that were traded every day you were you were in the you know kind of 10 to 15 billion dollar range if you include all coins you know let's let's take volumes that we think are legitimate that are published in a you know in a sensible kind of way derivatives plus spot I think you're down 60 60 to 70 percent from those volumes uh on average and so it could be a holiday liquidity vacuum it could be like uh no one's ever gonna care about this space again type thing it's the most bearish interpretation possible my personal view is that we're in for a bit of volatility and then we're going to start to grind higher like this is this is bad the second biggest exchange just exploded and turned out to be a you know an insolvent like pick your flowery word to describe what FTX was so I don't see much Fallout from here if anything there's more of a deficit of crypto than a surplus at this point what do you think Avi yeah it's it's interesting you know I I tweeted on a chart the other day uh that basically it's like that famous Wall Street chart right where it shows you the path the path of a bubble and it basically it basically ends with depression right an apathy and we're getting we're getting close I you know it's it's it's it's actually reminding me very much so of what happened in in 2018 where in 2018 you had that you had that break of you had that break of 6K you sell you sell off to 3K a lot of that was around minor death spirals it was around balance sheet offloading it was there was there's even there's even a rumor at the bottom that said that was circulating that freaked out a ton of people that satoshi's coins were on the move and obviously none of that you know none of that what did that feel like like you were in you were in the markets then what what did that feel like to you as a Trader like for me I'm new in this I you know it obviously feels pretty miserable right now what did it feel like to you back then when it went to 3K well you have to you have to remember that back in 2018 there were no real use cases for crypto it was all speculation today it's a lot less of that I mean you have thing you have defy you've got a lot of games that have integrated tokens you actually got a lot of usage of of eth you know you see Bitcoin actually being used in a couple in a couple different areas the the store of value narrative has really has really taken you know taken hold and you you can point to a bunch of different things about crypto and say hey okay yeah FTX collapsed yeah all these horrible things have happened yes there was a lot of Leverage on the system but there's fundamental usage for these applications and I think that in five years that that's going to be taken up and that real world assets are going to come to chain or you know metaverse economies are going to take off or whatever whatever narrative floats your boat at the at the time you know today it's actually it's a lot easier than it was in 2018 and it's it's for that reason because in 2018 you were you're sort of sitting there and you're thinking yourself okay so Bitcoin just went to 20K and it went down to three we had a tremendous amount of people come in and just get burned what's going to bring people back is crypto just dead because there are a bunch of icos that all went under Bitcoin Bitcoin bubble popped ethereum bubble popped and there wasn't that much that was happening on the building side that was visible to many people so if you were really really in it you started to see the inklings of defy the first iterations of defy and the people that really saw the future looked at things like uniswap it was launched in 2018 and they said okay this could be something but the majority of people they weren't looking at things like that at the time so what you got was you just got this overwhelming sense of depression that it just wasn't coming back and that meant that ninety percent of the people that I knew that were involved in crypto in the beginning of 2017. you're sorry at the end of 2017 we're no longer there at the end of 2018. say probably more than 90 so many people I knew just left they just didn't come back and this time it's a lot different was Cryptid Twitter a thing back then it was there was there publicly available it was yeah yeah you know it was it was it was it was a thing yes totally a thing um it was just a little bit stupider than it is today but more fun hard to imagine and uh oh it it was it was it was a complete Cesspool but it was a lot of fun and I was I was I was a really tiny account back then just following all the big guys uh but you know as I was I was there and and trying to try to keep up but you know you fast forward to 2018 and so so many people so many people just left right they just they just got out and when I compare that to today most people I know are sticking around and that actually makes me pretty bullish and it also makes me think that the the Hallmarks of a cycle are going to look a little bit different moving forward than they have than they have in the past because we've reached a critical point where there are enough people in this world that really believe that crypto is going to change things and can look at history and say well this is what happens in a in a boom bust cycle things go down 90 percent and then they go back up the useful stuff right and so today it's it's a little bit less depressing than it was than it was in 2018 because you have you know that that sort of foundation but it's still it's still apathetic I think people are scared I think that there's there there are a lot there are a lot of headwinds from you know both regulation Market structure there are all sorts of things that are our headwinds for the asset class but I'll flip I'll flip this on its head a bit and I'll say look at all of the horrible terrible things that have just happened and look at where Bitcoin is trading and look at where ethereum's trading yeah I mean in any asset class when when the price action looks kind of like it's outperforming the most horrendous set of news events normally you're supposed to interpret that as a sign of strength and you know I agree with you to the extent that every time you're talking about use cases for example like this isn't a 2018 scenario where people have you know totally justifiable means to say like hey this what what is this stuff used for like let's just start with the very basics Bitcoin is probably a better store of value and means of exchange than the world's bottom 100 Fiat currencies like I would if I lived in Chad I would rather own you know at worst a stable coin at best Bitcoin rather than whatever the local currency is uh in my in my environment for various reasons um stable coins real Innovation uh you can move value on Christmas at 3am you can keep money effectively have a dollar bank account that you can't get from JP Morgan if you don't live in a developed economy and then digital ownership we you know plenty of people I know laugh at nfts plenty of plenty of older people who know what Thundercats are laugh at nfts but you know if you deny the ownership of digital goods and services you know kind of kind of Grandpa Simpson at this stage so you know just right there you have the basis for something valuable um so I take your point about how this this isn't 2018 anymore and the point you made about how people aren't leaving the space like that's true too just look at this from like a practical investment perspective right now right you've got okay so you had one of the largest exchanges in the world blow up yeah you had it be a complete fraud you had them apparently just basically selling BTC and eth to go buy their [ __ ] coins of choice sorry uh you know bad coins of choice uh and then you have ethereum trading at 13 30 in in Bitcoin trading at 18K and that to me what that signals is that people really people really want these things people want Bitcoin people want ethereum and if you're bearish right now I think you're just coping I think you're coping with the fact that you probably got hit on the way down and you're coping with the fact that you didn't buy 15 15 5 and you're coping with the fact that you didn't you didn't buy you know a thousand dollar or sorry 1100 East right and you're sitting there and you're going well it has to go down okay why why why exactly why does it have to go down similarly people were coping on the highs when Bitcoin was trading 69k and you know things were getting more bullish and Bitcoin wasn't going up um bullish went from a macro perspective I think you had you know weakness uh in crypto against the backdrop of signs of macro strength that should have been a signal that things were headed lower and now you have the the opposite situation so you know it's a good point you make there 100 you have it you have a situation now and this is I think a useful generalizable framework for how to think about trading trading the markets right okay who are the buyers and who are the sellers in every scenario whenever I wake up in the morning and I assess the market I look at a bunch of I look at a bunch of different data points right you look at your funding rate to look at your open interests you look at you know on chain on chain metrics you look at flows order books whatever you want to look at right one thing that I try to do every morning is I'll sit there and I'll think about who's a buyer today and who's a seller today of these asset class right of these assets so in Bitcoin let's let's walk through that here who's who's a seller right who is selling 18K BTC that is new to the market right or that that want that wants to get out of their position forget whether they're new let's just talk about who would sell it ordinarily you know the listeners probably want to know like who who are the natural sellers of Bitcoin you've got miners right they mine Bitcoin they sell it to fund their operations some miners some some miners hold on to bitcoin and raise you know funds via debt or Equity to fund their operations um but some miners just go and sell it so you have constant minor selling that's one source um another source would be let's say whales early Bitcoin people who you know bought Bitcoin on Craigslist with some QR codes and now are worth hundreds or hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and they just say hey I want to launch some to you know buy another house right there's probably a bit of that or maybe some you know retail investors who got in at higher levels and now need to sell to to sort of fund lifestyle type things or a tax tax event um you know those are the types of sellers that you would normally see throughout the course of an ordinary business day in Bitcoin and an eth it used to be miners but they stopped after the merge which is which is a beautiful which is a beautiful thing and you know one one thing that is important is contextualizing when they're when those people are in the market and when they're not right so let's let's use Bitcoin 18K as an example so miners when you actually if you look at public you know public Miners and their balance sheets they don't really have much Bitcoin left and I think that's actually a reasonable comp for looking at how much Bitcoin just miners in general have to sell um it's just not that much right and so 18K BT is publicly available who's going to sell well well it's people yeah it's people it's people that you know are okay maybe they're underwater and they they want to they want to exit their positions or maybe they bought lower and they want to they want they want to exit their positions the people that are underwater I think basically everybody has sold post FTX right so if you were worried about losing on your Bitcoin position or you were worried are you or your stop loss your stop-loss got hit or your stop-loss got triggered or you're panicked about crypto or you just want to pull cash out and you want to raise your cash balances because the world the world looks really scary all that selling has actually already happened like who who's gonna who's gonna be the new person to panic here or the new person to say I'm gonna get out of this the marginal seller in my perspective right now are the people that bought lower and are just looking to trade orange shorts right because the people that lost faith in crypto or the people that wanted to raise cash or the people that panicked out because of FTX or the people that got their their stop losses triggered or the levered Longs all those guys just got washed out over the last over the last month yeah and so what you need in order to I think send Bitcoin lower is you need to entice new sellers into the market and new sellers into the market would come either a via a Black Swan event like a binance or teller going down or B Because macro goes down in correlation Traders come into the market and push this thing lower so right now the only person that I fear are the people that bought 15 16k and they want to take profit I don't think that that type of buyer bought 15 and 16k to sell 18K they probably bought 15 and 16k to sell 21 or 23 or 25 or to hold it for the next for the next cycle right they're not they're not buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin to flip from 16k to 18K yeah and and that Universe of people even if they did decide to buy at 15K to flip it 18K like they're just not holding that much Bitcoin that group like in Commodities markets in tradpy you call them weak hands they're they're day Traders they're not holding huge amounts of volume that move the market but like you know the the group of people that I was scared of that I was I was thinking gosh you know now that we've had this Fallout from FTX who's what's the next big wall of selling to hit the market I was worried that bankrupt lenders holding portfolios of coin would just be lambasting bids across the entire market and you know the the whole like FTX Alameda and you know name your list of bankrupt lenders selling billions of dollars worth of bitcoin even even the what little liquidity is left in the you know the Benchmark asset sitting on those balance sheets it might not get liquidated for years I mean they still haven't sold the mount gox tokens um or or unencumbered those like it's it's just less of a concern than it was and that that that was the big fear for a lot of people was the the bankruptcy proceedings I don't know what do you think yeah yeah no it's a big big fear for for for us too and you know that's why what do you look at I mean I don't know what's what what exactly is going on uh with with some of these with some of these bankruptcy proceedings but I know from you know our our internal our internal expertise that they take they take a long time to play out and that you know it's not it's not it's on overnight it's not an overnight liquidation and also by the way a lot of these people actually there's just not that much on the balance sheets anymore I mean selling you you you would have great insight into this so I wanna I wanna hop into it because I know you guys do do a lot of OTC but selling a billion dollars of Bitcoin well it sounds like a lot isn't that much anymore in the grand scheme of things because this thing trades a lot Bitcoin trades a ton and so I'm curious you know what what have you got I mean as a as as a firm that does a lot of uh trading with a lot of different counterparties what what have you seen post FTX in terms of change of Market structure or change of the type of person that you're trading with or the behavior of the people that you're trading with I'm curious what what you've seen internally that has changed yeah I mean thanks for asking it's uh I think it's a super relevant question I mean prior to FTX and we can get into what happened later with FTX I think a Marketplace is comprised of a number of different essential Services liquidity is a very important service custody is another one settlement perhaps the most important service if you send your Yen or your Euros off to some entity you're really hoping to receive your dollars back right so whoever you're doing that transaction with your settlement agent is very important you know then there are all sorts of ancillary services like uh you know providers of Leverage Etc anyway all of those Services were kind of getting Consolidated under a very limited number of roofs you had FTX basically doing all of that um you have binance doing all of that and at the time it seemed to run you know you can probably provide more insight into this than anybody you know your your crypto native tried and true like that's kind of against the ethos of crypto and decentralization anyway it was happening and as an OTC liquidity providers you know you adapt you go where the volumes are you start providing liquidity on exchanges you optimize your latency you go high tech science the science it figure it out as best you can but then post FTX blowing up everything changed right we were seeing sort of a decline in the number of counterparties that were interested in self-custody and trading OTC or custo you know using a a famous custodian you know there are a couple out there Zappo coinbase and then trading OTC most people were just sort of like banking with FTX and doing everything with FTX now the market instead of going that like Ultra centralized Direction which is kind of like call it commodity derivatives or equities it's kind of done a handbrake turn now things are starting to look a little bit more like FX we have silos of capital in this case digital asset Capital all around the world you have nodes of uh you know settlement agents uh we're one of them for example uh in the future there will be more perhaps banks will get involved and then those other Market services like provision of liquidity provision of Leverage those are all you know kind of being provided by leverage now you can get good leverage from Ave for example or you can get good liquidity from us and the providers of settlement in the future will aggregate all of those different Market Services white label them and offer them to you know customers the way that Morgan Stanley offers uh you know g10fx liquidity to people without necessarily providing it themselves so um ultimately what we've seen on the OTC side as a liquidity provider you know we provide liquidity on Exchange and OTC we've seen a you know record number of onboardings and uh counterparty interest in the month of November as people are looking for new you know Avenues to trade in the wake of FTX we're seeing basically all of these Market services decentralized we're seeing a big focus on Ethan Bitcoin after an initial flurry of like altcoin liquidation you know people just seeking liquidity and bids and uh solvency in any way they can and uh the nature of the counterparties that are onboarding surprisingly institutional um FTX really had deep inroads into the institutional space it wasn't just retail investors who were on that platform it was you know big big companies and those companies are now rethinking the way that they uh the way that they trade so you know FTX was a compelling story but I think now people really want to diversify their options for crypto liquidity and the odd thing about all this just to put you know kind of a Finishing Touch on the comment is um the volumes haven't really like crypto Market volumes are down but OTC volumes are up so otcs at least for now is a larger slice of a smaller pie and let me turn that around to you Avi um what if you know on your side as a proper investor in the space who understands all coins better than pretty much anybody what like where where are you focused on deploying risk Now versus before that blow up yeah it's a you know it's it's a good it's a good question and that the the tough part about post FTX is that you have to reevaluate every single counterparty every single person you trade with rigorously right and you really you really have to dive into it but basically everybody that we trade with now it's like okay let me see let me see let me see your audited financials who are you audited by are you audited by a a big four are you audited by some random three-person company in Idaho right it's like show like show me show me who's who's actually looking through your books right and you you ask you ask for they're worth parameters and then you just have discussions about how they manage risk in general because having those discussions a lot of the times gives you insight into how seriously people are taking it if you sit down with somebody and you and you ask them hey uh you know what do you what do you think about exchange risk versus protocol risk versus you know just like General market risk and they have approximately two minutes of content for you what that tells you is that they haven't thought about it that much help us think about it what is protocol risk what is exchange risk what is counterparty risk in like sound bites like how should we be thinking about this yeah I mean it's it's really it's really you know a a holistic thing I mean for for each for for each and I won't I won't bore everybody with the with the details but for each Silo of risk we have an extensive amount of metrics that we track to make sure that we're not taking too much risk right so with protocol risk you know we have we have Engineers on our team that look at every that look at every single protocol underwrite the code and basically answer like a three-page template on everything that we want to know about this protocol and everything that you know ever everything that we know we're taking a risk about uh and Grading it on a scale of one to five and then we set our risk parameters from there on the counterparty risk side you know it's looking at it's looking at financial statements we also have you know a big a big checklist of all the things of all the things that we wrote through and we actually have a committee of people both from tradfy and from crypto that now go sit down and every single counterparty that we use has to pass the test of this committee trying to poke holes is hey is this going to be an issue is that going to be an issue is this going to be an issue is that going to be an issue right you know like one example of this was uh you know if we're we were looking at we were looking at a trade on compound what like you know uh deploy deploying some Capital onto compound and one question that came up was in the in the event of a collapse of tether or a collapse of binance I'm not saying these things are are going to happen I'm just these are Black Swan events super low probability but let's say that happens or in a collapse of maybe even U.S usdc or a crazy A crazy event that none of us that none of us have foreseen how might that impact either pricing on compound could crazy liquidations occur uh you know how does oracle interpret uh you know smooth smooth out price if it if if it does will reserves be there so for example if we borrow a bunch of assets against usdc and then we pay back those assets is there a scenario that has caused a bunch of people to go borrow usdc so that utilization is super high and that 40 rate that compound caps out at isn't enough to attract new estc into the system and so we can't actually withdraw our usdc right because there's none left in the protocol right so it's like okay so you start you start to think through all the different all the different you know parameters and and what what you need to be thinking about at any at any given time and so you know we we group we group these things uh in into their own buckets and we have large checklists and discussions about each type of risk each type of risk that we're taking and that's you know in hindsight obviously very very important given given what happened with FTX but ongoing that's that's still going to be a huge you know a huge a huge thing and and people need to people need to start start paying attention to that is I think it was a very rude awakening for a lot of people to realize that no matter how good of a traitor you are if you're not conscious of these exogenous risks outside of Market risk you can still lose a lot of money in the space that's it because it's it's pretty amazing now that also presents that also presents opportunity right yeah like it presents opportunity and that's why we're here because there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for people to understand how to navigate it's I mean you hit the nail on the head right like Risk can sound boring to people who are just sort of dabbling in markets because it does involve homework and confusion and math and you know a lot a lot a lot of stuff that's not necessarily categorizable is fun but at the same time once you get it out of the way and once you integrate it into your process you know like you said when you're dealing with the exposed wiring of a brand new asset class tradable in a way no new asset class has ever been tradable before there are assets that will thousand X within that asset class and you know you can see during bull markets like 2021 how that how that can change people's entire uh you know lives um in terms of you know just like trying to contextualize what that opportunity might look like in the future I think I think it'd be pretty important to kind of dig into like in the wake of this post FTX hangover the price action is sort of telling you that you need to differentiate between one centralized crypto company called FTX happening to be something other than what we thought it was and like Bitcoin or ethereum processing blocks like those blockchains work just fine and they did throughout the entire collapse of that centralized ecosystem so I think the point you made earlier about how buoyant prices are against the backdrop of all this misery and and sort of bearishness tells you that that the kernel of something very important is going on here and you know hopefully what we can pick apart on this podcast is like what do you buy what do you invest in and what do you look for to capture what you know I assume both of us probably assume is going to be a you know the upswing in in the coming cycle and we do believe this is a cycle we don't think this is a secular decline here so say on the Cumberland side one thing that we're looking at is like D5 Primitives uh even though they had their summer in 2020 they're starting to look pretty interesting again like if you're just going to ask yourself what is a blockchain good for the entire centralized lending industry just disappeared as a trading house you need to borrow lots of capital and coin to facilitate the liquidity that that people need and again even though volumes are down tens of billions of dollars worth of this stuff for trading all the time and so this is this isn't a market that telegraphs signs of apathy right so if we're going to provide that liquidity to the market we have to figure out where we can go and borrow stuff and increasingly it's on chain you know back in the day uh you know way back six months ago it's pretty easy to just go get Bitcoin or eth loan to you at stupidly low interest rates from companies that are now bankrupt that's over now you look on chain you get fantastic liquidity on things like Ave and a couple of other protocols and it's like wait a second this is this is real like this is real amounts of capital perhaps if like you said Avi if if the protocol risk is justifiable and you can analyze it all in the white paper it's clear as day you can see it Unchained like if it makes sense perhaps that's that's like the next leg of something something worthwhile it's just D5 Primitives you know yeah I I agree and I wanna I wanna talk about a little bit about how I've started thinking about investing especially post post FTX I think it was Warren Buffett who had that you know I I buy I buy great you know great companies at great prices uh that that that's a that's a little bit how I'm thinking about the market right now which is which is that you have finally sorry a separation between the good and the bad and crypto so in 2021 there was this concept of the hot ball of money right you'd get speculation move from one protocol to another protocol to another protocol to another protocol and price would follow where these narratives and where these people were going but the narratives were they weren't real they were transparent they were fake and they were manufactured in many in many ways because people wanted them to be true because if it was true then they could make a lot of money and you fast forward to today where their l1s and their D5 protocols and their metaverse and gaming companies that are all proving that they're more valuable than others either through better BD or continue Dev adoption or better Tech progress you're actually seeing differentiation in a lot of these in a lot of these companies and valuations actually haven't caught up in many cases so the way that I think about this is is really is really twofold it's what is one how good just on an absolute basis are these companies what's the address of what's what's the addressable Market you know how big can they get how valuable is it really is it you know better than the current than the current state of things and then the other angle is well how much is that appreciated right now right and you start to realize that because of the recent collapse in crypto a lot of valuations have come back down to earth right there are protocols with working products in defy at 30 to 60 million dollar valuations and their Venture deal is getting funded at 30 million dollars per product right now right and you got to scratch your head and say wait a second that doesn't one of these things is wrong now it might be that the Venture stuff is just way way overvalued or it might be that they're these liquid products out there that are actually useful that are just beaten down because the Market's beaten down and because nobody's actually doing doing the real work to come in and to come in and figure out what what the real what the real value these things are right and so you sort of have this really nice Market environment right now where you can be both a long-term investor and get in at you know reasonable valuations for some you know they're they're obviously still a bunch of very overvalued things in crypto and I think that will that that will persist uh you know and a lot a lot of them will fail and a lot of them a lot of them will blow up uh but there's also a lot of undervalued stuff in crypto in crypto right now and my goal as an investor is to come up with ways to screen and assess that undervaluation right so one of the things that our analysts uh you know our analyst in over the last week which I thought was really useful was going through they went through the top 300 projects on coin gecko and they basically gave an explanation of what it was let me tell you there are a lot of random projects out there that you've never heard of that are in the top 300 on coin Gecko and out of it came a couple of interesting gems we were like oh we didn't know about this thing before but it actually looks kind of interesting it actually looks reasonably fairly valued right and so going through this process of especially now instead of looking at all the same stuff that other people are looking at try to go find the new stuff that's out there the stuff that's overlooked right and put in the work the thing that's beautiful about this Market environment absolutely beautiful is that we currently have in my opinion a lazy Trader problem where people aren't putting in the work everybody's going on Christmas is coming up you know holidays end of year Market's depressed no this is the best time to be working 14-hour days looking at random stuff right because this is this is actually great trading it's a great trading environment it's a great investing environment and you're not I'm not I'm not fighting anybody else guess what nobody's fighting me on this because they're off on vacation right now yeah that's good that's great it's great for me or just or just sitting on the sidelines like from from you know the liquidity provision perspective you see you know in terms of counterparties that we trade with if you're an allocator and you're you're in charge of deploying Capital into crypto crude oil stocks bonds everything else you're kind of gonna get fired if you go and launch a bunch of your investors money into crypto right now and lose 40 percent of it meanwhile um you're not going to get fired if the thing 3x is from here and you Pile in at the same time as all your peers do because then it's kind of justifiable that's the you know kind of the game theory of passive Investment Management in many cases and so um nobody's you know nobody's proactively knife catching at this point uh there have been several knife catch uh acts of heroism by various you know people and institutions over the course of this year and I think you know at these lows a lot of them have been burned so I think they're on the sidelines and like you said Avi there are some real gems I mean we don't we do a version of what you were talking about we haven't gone through the you know the coins on coin gecko that we aren't invested in but sometimes we just review the ones that we are invested in we look at them and review and say why did we do this why are we invested what are the sort of key performance indicators the kpis that are that we're looking for in terms of you know metrics of success that we expect to drive the appreciation of this token according to tokenomics that we've theoretically looked through and you know if you if you do that review which is a version of what you were specifically describing Avi like on on your portfolio yeah you can do this as a retail investor you can even if the only thing you hold is Bitcoin you should just think this through like if you do it once a month often it's it's kind of evident that you should either be adding a whole lot of risk to your your crypto position or perhaps reducing or cutting it entirely and you know I really like that framework I think I I might have picked it up from one of your podcasts a long time ago but um it works it works just like what is this coin why do I want to own it yeah and and I think the the mistake that a lot of people make is they they associate kpi with fundamentals and it's this is just something that you should do with any trade right so a lot of the times we'll be trading off of Just data right so funding let's say let's say we find a coin trading at 200 annualized negative negative funding rate open interest has gone Forex people are shorting it and they're just aggressively off-sites right should we look at this and go okay this is a candidate is this a candidate for a short squeeze okay let me pull up let me pull up my parameters for what makes what makes a good short squeeze right are they shorting because of an event are they shorting because they're just shorting are they you know where where are the shorts where are the shorts coming in what's the average entry price what's the average entry price of the shorts and then you know you start to you start to construct a plan right you start to say okay so if I know that the let's asset a the average entry price of a short is 10 bucks it's trading at eight right now uh I know that it's 200 annualized but it normally trades you know at let's say negative 10 annualized because that's just how things have been trading trading recently and I know that uh this much open interest this much open interest is added okay then I can start to construct a plan a trade plan I say once it hits 10 there's probably going to be a little bit of a squeeze and the short the short the shorts are going to exit once funding rate comes in but let's let's say I'm being conservative if it goes in below 50 40 annualized to short I'm going to take off some of the trade and take off 25 30 if it goes below 25 annualized it'll take off 75 if open interest decreases by 50 I'll take off 50 right and now you start to have almost a system for trading these things yeah so when you hear the word kpi because I know a lot of a lot of people a lot of people will will hear that and they'll go okay well what does that mean well it just means a plan just have a plan like take your take whatever data you're using take whatever information and you apply this to the fundamentals too right maybe you're maybe you're betting on Matic and you're saying I think that Starbucks is going to drive a ton of usage to Matic okay monitoring yep take a look set up a system to actually make sure that your thesis is your thesis play I think one of one of the funniest things about crypto and this happens to me all the time Jonah I mean you'll have a thesis you'll establish a position it'll work fantastically and it'll have been absolutely not because of your thesis at all those things work out for you usually uh on our side they don't but nice to hear that that you're hitting that single Sometimes some Sometimes some sometimes they do sometimes I mean some things one thing you mentioned just now that's super interesting though is like the process is so important and like one thing you mentioned as part of this like kind of mock process is the funding rate to getting short crypto like you were talking about a short squeeze scenario shorting crypto especially shorting all coins has never been more expensive than it is today there are no lenders left except the ones on chain for all intents and purposes with maybe one or two exceptions if you're very institutional so like Matic you brought it up you want to get short that thing you are paying through the ears to bet that that's going down and do you really want to do that with crypto you know 60 70 80 90 off the all-time highs with uh the FED about to Pivot with narratives starting to to pop up that are looking a little bit bullish and one one particularly interesting thing is in the wake of this binance uh scare assets are getting yanked off exchanges like crazy nobody wants to leave their money on an exchange anymore even the slightest bit of crypto Twitter fear people just pull hundreds of millions billions of dollars off these exchanges what does that mean that means there's less crypto available available for sale at any given time so it's almost a bullish technical that really contradicts The bearish Narrative right so the people you know if you if you've identified like Avi said like one of these one of these uh candidates for a short squeeze and all this is playing playing out in the backdrop probably a pretty good time to get to get long and play for Avi I think you tweeted the the god candle um that's you know certain it's it's not it's been a bit of a bit of a me a bit of a meme from the past but basically I just I just keep seeing all these people shorting the market and I keep seeing all these people being bearish in the market and price isn't going down and you just have to take your ego and throw it out the window you just listen to what the Market's telling you when I was an oil Trader in 2020 like people were people were saying in 2020 no one's ever going to use crude oil again you know it sure went negative that's really scary it's really just one little Benchmark at one particular place in uh you know Cushing Oklahoma that went negative the rest of the world's crude oil was pretty positive at the time but you know you heard these narratives like it's over it's no one's No One's Gonna burn petroleum anymore and you know obviously uh Bitcoin now and crypto at large is sort of where crude oil was a hundred years ago but I think that's it's an important lateral to make because you know if there's any other asset class that represents liquid tradable early stage technology it's Commodities and I think the you know the fear the you know the fear in Euphoria Cycles there kind of mimic those in crypto and we're certainly at at a point where people are once again calling it a you know crypto kind of a useless asset class scam no use case but obvious you said like Matic Starbucks like at what what what's going to make you believe in crypto if not polygon breaking companies with billions of users into this space like metamask has 30 million users that's got to be the biggest app in crypto right now uh and then polygon suddenly just lands Instagram uh Reddit Starbucks Nike uh what what's going on there uh like should we be focused on FTX being a big deal or that being a big deal what do you think I you know I'm I'm with you I mean I think you know this this has been sort of sad Ad nauseam at this point but FDX is not crypto yeah like FTX was just a player in crypto and crypto is here to stay and that you know that that that that's almost like a it's it's a it's a cop-out for people to get out of the space I mean it just it just doesn't make any sense you know when Lehman when Lehman went down yeah sure there were people calling for the end of the whole banking system but was that true no I worked there I again it's the old man in the room having been everywhere got to get to claim that one yeah people were talking about a resource War back then you worked at you worked at Lehman I did I did I was you were you there when it collapsed that's right I was I was a uh I started as a first-year analyst in the credit default swaps trading department at Lehman Brothers in 2007 and you know that was like considered a good job at the time are you kidding I'm not that was my you were in you were in CDs in 2000 you joined Lehman and did CDs in 2007 yeah my mom is super disappointed in me everything it gets worse from there then crude oil and now this like you know that was crazy I mean the thing the thing literally blew up uh you know we the the CEO said everybody's fine like the company's liquid um you know I sat on the credit desk so obviously the guy who traded um corporate Financial bonds like JP Morgan and Lehman of course and Morgan Stanley and Goldman he was down the road busy you know bidding Lehman debt to try and support the price of it uh to make the company seem more you know credit worthy to external investors who you know the CEO and his cronies were hoping would bail it out and then Lehman ran out of cash the bonds tanked and then you know spiraled into bankruptcy pretty quickly um and then shortly thereafter I got like an email from Barclays Capital which bought Lehman's businesses out of bankruptcy uh sort of like CZ almost did with with FTX before he backed out where it's like you know you get an email that says Dear Lehman employee if you would like a 90-day conditional uh employment offer that can be terminated at will at any time from Barclays Capital please reply with accept in the subject line otherwise please reply with uh you know reject or deny I forget and yeah that that's that was my career at that point um that stunk but yeah people were talking about a resource War they were like okay well you know the banking system's gone so you're gonna hoard physical gold uh you know buy some land with fresh water the distressed credit guys were all over that stuff golden tree was probably crushing it and um you know honestly like it was a weird time but usually you know when something like that plays out in any given Market you're or in you know oil going negative in 2020 you're like three to six maybe nine months from the dead ball lows at worst or you've already seen them like how you know it can always get worse of course but like you said at the beginning of this podcast Avi like prices are holding in right now and the bottom just fell out they're wait like if you're a Trad five participant in crypto if you just joined crypto like I did at the euphoric highs in q421 and you're looking at this like how do I justify this career to my family I think the um you know I think the the takeaway here is like it's it's scary but it's just another market like this is not some new thing that's going to zero it's just another Market cycle and we've seen so many of these before it almost feels benign compared to the Lehman one where the whole financial system was about to collapse except this time in crypto you don't have a digital Tim Geithner to bail everybody out you don't have like in 2020 a digital OPEC to cut Supply and pump prices back up econ 101 is just gonna play out like it did in your college textbook and you know like you said if you do the analysis you understand the white papers the protocols and the credit risk and the counterparty risk involved it starts to become predictable and you know if you and I are both bullish and we both do our homework independently like you know perhaps there's a threat of bullishness out there um with a bit of you know basis in reality I would hope you know I think I think that's a that's a beautiful way to end this which is that everything old is new and everything new is old and Jonah is the old man in the room has seen it all so I think that was uh you know I really really really really had a good time what do they say Avi five years in crypto is one year in normal life and you've been in crypto how long no it's uh one year in crypto's five years in normal life it's dog years oh [ __ ] it's my old brain just you know anyway um I've been in crypto for I guess six years now wow it's been a while so that's 30 years you're a 30-year veteran of this stuff but anyway this is a great this is a great uh great time chatting with you Jonah I think we covered we covered most of the topics on the next on the next podcast we're gonna have a we're gonna have a pretty special guest but I'm super excited for you guys for you for you guys to meet he hasn't done many media appearances but he runs one of the most successful trading firms in the world and uh I think if you think hard enough you might be able to guess who it is I'll give you a hint one of the trading firms is where we work great great talking to everybody and as always uh none of this is investment advice crypto is risky be careful out there great talking to you Avi [Music]
