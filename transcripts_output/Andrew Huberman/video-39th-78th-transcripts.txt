Title: How to Build Strength, Endurance & Flexibility at Any Age | Pavel Tsatsouline
Published: 2025-02-10 13:00:51 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Pavel Tsatsouline, a world-renowned strength and conditioning coach, former military special forces training instructor, author, and founder of StrongFirst—an online school focused on “low-tech, high-concept” training to build strength for men and women of all fitness levels.

We discuss the most effective and efficient ways to build strength, endurance, and flexibility. We cover bodyweight-only, free-weight, and machine-based protocols and describe training splits and lesser-known but highly effective ways to train, especially for people with limited time.

We also discuss local versus systemic nervous system and muscle recovery, how to complete training sessions with increased energy, why training to “failure” is not advised, optimal rest-between-sets protocols to improve performance, and how to vary effort levels across each week and month to ensure regular progress. This episode brings you highly practical, science-supported, and real-world-tested training methods to build strength, endurance, and flexibility from one of the world’s top experts.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Pavo satlin Pavo satlin is considered one of the Premier strength training and fitness coaches in the world he has pioneered the development of various programs to improve strength which he calls the mother of all Fitness indeed today you will learn about strength as a practice as a skill that can be applied to sports that can be applied to general fitness to getting leaner to getting faster and to improving your endurance as Pavo Satan explains by building one's strength through body weight exercises free weight exercises and occasionally machines one can develop incredible levels of Fitness at any age we discussed some of the spectacular examples of people in their 70s and 80s performing strength Feats like 100 pull-ups per week and we emphasize that one does not have to be seeking hypertrophy one does not have to be seeking getting larger muscles in order to get exceptionally strong I myself these days am focusing primarily on trying to get stronger and build endurance for sake of health and for General Life reasons and because getting really strong turns out to be very beneficial in every aspect of life today you're going to learn how to get extremely strong you can add muscle if you want in parallel with that or as pav Satan explains you can pursue strength and flexibility for their own sake and there's tremendous value for doing so so today's discussion pertains to women to men and frankly to people of all ages I do think that pursuing strength as its own thing independent of muscle growth right which we hear so much about these days everyone wants hypertrophy grow muscle this and that pursuing strength as its own thing is a tremendously valuable Endeavor today you're going to learn how from the world world's Premier expert in this topic you're in for a very special episode with Pavo satlin he is truly in a class all his own when it comes to Fitness and strength training before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme this episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with Pavo saulin Pavo sat welcome Andrew uh pleasure to be on your podcast I respect your work a lot thank you likewise thank you I will say that you and perhaps one other person have truly changed the way that I think about Fitness the way that I train and I'm super excited to talk to you today so I'm withholding excitement there are a bunch of different ways to think about this thing that we call Fitness strength endurance hypertrophy and there's so much information out there now how do you conceptualize fitness meaning do you look at things through the lens of Are We focused on nervous system bone connective tissue or muscle do you look at things through the lens of anterior chain posterior chain hypertrophy strength I would just like to get your sort of high level conceptualization of this thing that we call Fitness with the idea in mind that most people would like to have some level of endurance some level of strength and feel healthy and presumably look however they want to look but let's set Aesthetics aside for the moment how do you think about this thing we call Fitness well first of all Andrew is uh strength is the mother mother quality of all the other qualities so this is again it's a statement by Professor M mat going way back and without a foundation of strength you cannot build anything so any athletic event requires a base of strength of course that uh shot putters going to need much more strength than Triathlon uh Triathlon athlete but they all need strength speaking of which uh in Triathlon in Marathon running in distance uh in cycling it's been proven that putting athletes on a heavy low repetition strength regimen the kind that doesn't really add muscle but just makes you stronger neurologically and uh it makes them race faster so once you're stronger everything becomes easier how much stronger you need to get that will vary in the Soviet Union they had something called the model athlete so they figured out that for every particular event uh your odds of succeeding are going to be much higher if you're able to you know Squad this much or bench this much and jump this high and so on and so forth and this is easy enough to find these numbers for your individual Sport and talk to various coaches for people who are not competitive athletes who just want to enjoy life you just need to think about uh having a reserve of strengths for whatever it is that you might do so look at some PT standards and let's say in the military or in law enforcement and possibly apply them to yourself I don't want to impose my set of Standards because there are many different like I might prefer you know pull-ups and X and Y and Z but if we're looking at strength as the foundation for General physical preparation right so there's such a thing as general strength preparation that's part of that there's also you know special strength which is Sport specific work that's different and uh there are different ways of getting this done but as you and I know that uh certain exercises are going to have a great carryover outside these particular exercises so as long as you're mobile as long as you're symmetrical and those are the things you have to address first you need to look into work of uh gr cook for example then strength has to be your priority once you have reached a certain level strength that's appropriate for your sport or appropriate for your lifestyle at that point you can just maintain it and focus and other qualities so I will um give you an example uh Soviet scientists research and Gena they OBS they measured a number of athletes in 20 different sports athletes of different levels so they evaluated various quality one was absolute strength and other was rate of force development pretty much power and the third was is the rate of muscular relaxation so how quickly the muscle can relax after contraction which is very very important and they have found that uh strength grew just very little from the intermediate level to the advanced level there's not a lot of improvement power increased a little bit more but the speed of relaxation is just just shut up as the athlete be became more advanced so it's again so strength it is the modable qualities but that's not the end all for everybody so reach the level that is appropriate for your Sporter activity then just maintain it efficiently and uh focus on something else if we talk about strength if we talk about other qualities well we'll get to them later what movements do you believe if they exist all people should include in their weekly routine someplace when thinking about how to develop perhaps maintain but but for most people it's going to be the goal of still achieving some strength okay strength increase excuse me I think there has to be a very low quantity of exercises just very few exercises you want to focus on and uh I'm going to give you some options to choose from so what we try to do a strong first in my company my school of strength is we try to provide people with various simple very low Tac High concept ways of addressing reaching their needs because for one reason or another for this indiv the barbell is the preferred tool for another it's the kettle bell or body weight or some or something else so I'm not going to say that if you don't do kettle bell swings or barbell squats you'll never amount to anything that's just not true but you can pick some you can pick some events so you definitely ought to do something for a posterior chain you absolutely do if we are looking at uh at the barbell I would start out with the narrow Sumo deadlift so this is narrow grip but not Nar grip pardon me but your stance is just wide enough to let your arms through uh your arms stay parallel to each other and uh so you just find it very comfortable stance for yourself so Professor Mill has been in your podcast he explained to you about the uh you know different hip architecture and so on so you have to find whatever works whatever works for you and when people talk about functional strength training and then they start standing on a ball and jugle oranges doesn't make a lot of sense to me because that doesn't look like my life or yours probably right but if you have to get a heavy bag of groceries or something you got a deadlift and the narrow Sumo deadlift so if you look at powerlifters an example would be classic example would be Ed cone that's a narrow St Sumo I'm not talking about wide Sumo that's a very sport specific event and uh you practice that first you learn how to hip hinge it's extremely important to learn how to hip hinge again uh Steward stress that how important it is for your back health and for your longevity so you learn to do that then whether you decide to pursue deadlift or not if you decide not to pursue High numbers in the deadlift maybe it's not appropriate for you or maybe you're liking the coaching a fantastic exercise for everybody is a zercher squat so in the zercher squat you hold the bar like this in the crooks of your elbows so it's resting right here it's possible to pick it up off the ground but it's you know it's it's an advanced skill that's it's an advanced skill better just to walk it off the rack the advantage of the zerra squad over let's say the back squat or the front squat is even if you have messed up shoulders wrists elbows you still can do that coaching uh desert your squat is very easy very simple and you have tremendous reflex of stabilization uh of your midsection it's just very very powerful so you acquire that skill of getting tight so getting high numbers on that exercise in the zercher so let's say an athlete could shoot for double double body weight it that's that's a really good goal and the bar for those listening not watching is cradled in the in the crooks of the elbows in front of the body are the arms uh cross you can hold them like this you can hold them like this or different ways of holding them you definitely would want to get proper coaching uh you don't want to you know you don't want to bruise yourself you want to be comfortable you want to do it right but it's not doesn't take a lot of skill to do that you find some pressing exercise and again uh if we're sticking with the example of the barbell the bench breast has gotten better reputation you know thanks to the gimm Bros and you know all gim Bros do is they bench pretty much well these days they also check out their phones I guess every set between every set the 11th rep I joke people checking their phones yeah there we go but if you look at athletes they athletes who also do some lower body work some posterior chain chain work and something for the midsection and again Zer sad could address that they are making a great use of the bench press so it's nothing it's a very simple exercise well not very simple it's a relatively simple exercise and uh unlike other pressing exercises it allows you to make strength gains with a very low volume of training so you can do several sets of five once a week in the bench press and keep getting stronger good luck doing that to the overhead press or the one arm push-up or something like that so those are just couple examples uh there are many other examples you can do snatch grip deadlifts you can uh list as very very long we can address the same thing in the same way with kettle bells you can look in the body weight exercises but you need to find several exercises that have a reputation for building strength that reaches beyond the ability to do this exercise if you just do curls you know you're going to do you're going to get better at curls but not at much else so Canadian um Canadian scientist back in the 80s the duale and his team made some interesting uh some interesting discoveries and again they just found that doing something leg extension is not going to carry over to the squad it just not the coordination is so radically different so you find several exercises that you enjoy that don't hurt you that uh you uh have the equipment available that you got the proper coaching for and you pretty much stick with them and there's absolutely no reason for you to change these exercises it's possible to change them on the margins you know from a wide grip bench press to Nar grip bench press uh squats with a Paws and so on and so forth but you don't really have to do uh a great variety of things variety it's a good topic we can discuss this later but uh like looking at the example of weightlifting as much as we can find many reasons why variety could be beneficial improved neuroplasticity uh reduced uh reduced risk of repeative strain injury and so on but the so did the statistics in weightlifting there's no correlation between the number of exercises and uh the platform results and for people outside the sports it's going to be the same so find this limited just limited battery of exercises that you can ex you can do well you can do painfree and just enjoy them for years I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night now one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to ensure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of the Pod cover called the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity I find that very useful because I like to make the bed really cool at the beginning of the night even colder in the middle of the night and warm as I wake up that's what gives me the most slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep it also has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover go to 8sleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in both your short and long-term health is your body's ability to manage blood glucose or blood sugar to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or crashes I first started using levels about 3 years ago as a way to understand how different foods impacted my blood glucose levels and it's proven incredibly informative for determining my food choices when I eat specific foods and how I time eating relative to things like my workouts both weight training and cardiovascular training things like running and when to eat before I go to sleep to allow for the most stable blood sugar throughout the night indeed using levels has helped shape my entire schedule so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself you can go to levels. linkhub levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now they're also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. link spelled l i n k/h huberman to try the new sensor in two free months of membership would a combination across the week of some sort of squat let's say the zercher squat a um perhaps a kettle bell swing or something else for a posterior chain pull up and dip be a fair Fairly comprehensive program absolutely I'm a fan of dips I like dips a lot I heard you say that you uh were some years ago you said that you were using dips for economy of time um and I started getting into dips I um haven't quite figured out the best way to load dips once because once you get past 15 20 repetitions of the body weight dip it gets I turns into something else sure absolutely uh it turns into aerobic exercise perhaps well uh Luke Iams uh he was a powerlifter from the Golden Age of American powerlifting he says anything over six reps is bodybuilding yeah I'm trying to stay in the lower rep range today I'll talk about this with you more uh because I think a growing number of people both men and women who are starting to do weight training or really incorporate strength training into their program are seeking a combination of strength and perhaps endurance as well without putting on too much size maybe size in some select body parts Andrew I think they need to uh do possibly several different types of types of training but going going back to your examples dips are fantastic if you can if your shoulders can handle them if you know how to do them it's a great exercise but not particular Democratic that's the problem so either you can do it safe or you can't and possibly it's possible to coach some people to do to do the dip so if you're coaching somebody to do the dip the first prerequisite is to build up to a full skin the cat so it means you're hanging upside down you know look up what it means folks uh on a bar so you got to be able to get yourself in that position so if you're able to do that and if you're able to get out of the position you know strongly and confidently there's a good chance that you can start up and doing dips and be coached into that if you can't probably not so either try to build up to that unless there medical restrictions or not uh you mentioned the example of pull-ups absolutely pull-ups are one of the best General strength exercises and again to your listeners uh General versus special special in Soviet terminology just means sport specific so the carryover when you start doing pull-ups when you excel at pull-ups or the dips you are going to get a carryover so far beyond these exercis which is exactly the reason you do that so I like your choices very much yeah what about specialized training for grip strength I I believe that if somebody's large if they can squat 500 lb if they can deadlift 600 lb I don't really care if um the question is can you open the pickle jar sure this is a critical I just get my wife to do it so uh it's uh grip strength is extremely important and you being in neuroscientist you know the disproportional representation the motor cortex of your gripping muscles and the forarm and everything so so uh and there's another reason why grip is so important so if you make a fist if you make a very tight fist you're going to feel uh you're going to feel the Overflow of tension IR radiation going to other muscles so pretty much by gripping tighter you are instantly increasing your strength in anything that you do and uh so very simple example for your listeners take some um pedestrian exercise like curls and and do as many strick traps as you possibly can the way you normally do them and then start just crushing that bar or that dumbbell or whatever that you're curling you will immediately be able to knock out several more reps so that makes you so much stronger and again the value of a strong wrist and grip is obviously very important uh for whatever reason obviously it correlates with longevity we don't know why we have no idea correlation is not uh causation so we don't know whether getting stronger a stronger grip is going to make us live longer but statistic basically is worth a try right so one can either find exercises that train the grip in the context of developing something else or train the grip directly so either way is is great so the first examples would be climbing the Rope or doing pull-ups and weighted pull-ups on a rope that's a great way to train obviously so what you do the way you program it is uh let's say once a week you climb the rope and a couple days a week you do pull-ups that's a good way to go about it and you don't need to do anything else and another example would be some exercises like the cattle Bell snatch when you start snatching a heavy kettle bell and you drop it from overhead that eccentric loading uh is is very very powerful and that develops grip very very well and again right now we're talking more about what uh what people in the grip world called the crushing grip you know how you squeeze something there are other types of grip that they differentiate but this type of crushing grip is what's going to help most athletes and non-athletes the most and uh I also warn you that uh hanging on the bar and doing Farmers carries beneficial as they are for many reasons it's not going to do that much for it interesting I started incorporating Farmers carries thinking it was going to improve my grip but they're healthy uh if you look at McGill's work you will he he will tell you that carrying two heavy objects it's going to really pound your spine and uh but on the other hand as symmetrical carry it appears to be very beneficial then there's another interesting example now right now I'm not talking about grip training at all uh I'm not even talking about strength training but I'm talking about sort of a former run uh Dr Mike Prost who used to work with the US Marine Corps Navy he developed this very interesting protocol and a test called the kettle bell mile where you take a kettle bell that's approximately 30% of your body weight and uh he he has good reasons for why it has to be that way and you pretty much run with this kettle bell and you switch hands as much as often as you want and it's a fantastic way to uh improve your running posture to develop very stabilizing muscles and to improve your ability to rock but it doesn't beat you up as much rocking does you know rocking carrying heavy weight that's it's rough on the body so it's a fantastic way uh it's a fantastic way to to train your endurance an additional way how heavy is the kettle bell that 30% because he says when you start going heavier it's going to affect your gate so you're not really you know you have to you have to kick your hi over to the side it becomes it becomes something else that's a heavy Kettle Bill 30% of your body weight yeah I mean I'm 210 lbs it's not not trivial it's probably something like to 62 LBS or something like that uh 70 lb Kettle bill it's not no no no it's not trivial by any means but it's also not something you jump in to immediately and also what's very cool is because you get to switch hands very often you're not destroying uh your ql and other stabilizers that Contracting isometrically and so what we're doing right now here is kind of a form of anti-glycolytic training if you muscle contracts briefly and relaxes contracts relaxes with and the contraction Cycles are really short you're able to avoid glycolysis you're able to keep that muscle working aerobically for a long time and not beat yourself down so uh to the listeners who'd like to try it start by walking with a kettle bell pass you know switch hands off and then eventually build up to running and obviously build up gradually held like a suitcase yes only only like a suitcase mhm okay yeah there's a podcast um led by a guy named cam Haynes he's a bow hunter he's one of the people that really brought Extreme Fitness and Ultras to the sport of bow hunting and is legendary there and for his podcast he has you carry the 72lb rock up a it's about 1,000 feet of the wildness and I've done it it's uh it's hard because of the shap of the thing and so you're moving it from shoulder to uh to you know to football carry to uh you know uh infant carry and uh you're not talking about that you're talking about suitcase on the right correct are you trying to crush the grip while you're doing it no you're not no this is not this is not developing a grip whatsoever and and you're running at a 10 20 minutes 30 minutes well he's go he says run for a mile that's the goal and he has some numbers I can give you a link can look at up Dr Mike prast and direct grip strength strength training is great as well so for example the best product for that would be the captains of Crush grippers from Iron mind iron mind iron mind is the company that started a serious grip training pretty much in modern era and their grippers are the golden standard some years ago my colleague as strong for Brad Jones and I we decided to get serious about it and see what that feels like and we spel spent many many months we were both able to build up to uh uh closing the number three gripper uh from a parallel set so uh that means that gripper takes 280 lbs to close and when you're using very small muscle groups it's extremely extremely hard and the observations that we both made and uh other colleagues and people have made that once you are able to do that everything becomes so much easier however the training itself is extremely hard because people are thinking that when you're training the grip is just some kind of isolated thing you can you can write it drive the car and you can kind of squeeze this little pink thing that you picked up at uh at the department store no when you train with a heavy duty gripper like the one from Iron mind it's a full body effort and you need to use um pretty much every neurological trick in the book in order to to uh exert yourself so for example if you uh if you have ever seen uh the sunanin stance in Kate which is it's a stance where the knees are kind of pulled Inward and uh shoulders are pressed down there's a lot of lot of tension everything everything's very very seriously engaged the toes are gripping the ground so you're pretty much gripping the ground with your toes you're Contracting your glutes you're bracing very very hard you're compressing your viscera your ltis firing and you're sending this all this effort everything the only thing they're not working like you try to keep your traps and face out of this and you're directing this effort into your goup you get just as tired from doing that work as from uh doing like heavy squats or something that's remarkable but if you like that it's a fantastic thing to do well the the motor neuron recruitment that you are describing is phenomenal um I have one reflection on this relationship between grip strength and Longevity uh just a a little bit of Neuroscience um you may be familiar with this so forgive if you are but for the listeners as well the motor neurons that control movement of the Torso lie closer to the midline on both sides of the spinal cord the motor neurons that are responsible for more distal mus muscles um that is further from the midline sit outside of those and so as you get out to the movement of the digits you know the fingers and toes um those are the most distal from the midline the rate and pattern of degeneration of neurons as a function of Aging even if there's no ALS or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or anything is always outside in we don't know why this is it may relate to the uh presence of the enzyme um sod superoxide dutas um but it does seem that people that train their peripheral strength they can offset some of that outside to in or distal to more uh close to the midline degeneration so I believe and this is just a belief that it's not just correlative that when one trains their periphery they actually can offset some of the degeneration it's also the way it's mapped in the brain which is a kind of a discussion outside of here we need to get some diagrams up for people to really um conceptualize that but it's also the case if you look at older people 70 80 90 their calves are generally atrophied even if their torso is still very thick and muscular if they did training so I feel like obviously training the core and the Torso is so key but training the the peripheral muscles at least from the perspective of longevity it makes sense why that would be important well there are so many reasons obviously to do that so I think that whether you choose to do that directly with grippers or and there are some other devices obviously unlimited number of devices and exercises or as a part of another exercise like climbing the Rope uh definitely strongly encouraging your listeners to do that I'm going to try this running with the kettle bell on one side for I'll go out for a mile with it on the right and then oh no no you s all the time as much as you want because if you try to do on one side you're going to pound your stabilizers just pound them you're not going to recover forever and this way this is one of the secrets secrets to developing uh isometric endurance is very uh rapid switching you know short contractions and uh brief rests and over and over and over that way you are not uh you you know the muscle doesn't go uh into esia and you know keeps getting oxygen pretty much I'd like to talk about concentric versus Ecentric portions of a movement concentric generally being the lifting phase and Ecentric of course folks the the lowering phase um is there a case for just doing concentric movements yes um is there a case for emphasizing the Ecentric portion uh how does one balance those when thinking about soreness recovery and frequency of training okay well first of all the case for concentric only is if you're trying to minimize muscle girls and uh if you also are trying to minimize soreness so for athletes uh in weight classes or athletes in sports where you get punished by carrying extra weight it's a very good idea so for example uh when Barry Ross coached telis and Felix at that point she became the uh fastest she won the 200 meters uh in the world she was 17 years old I think she was the youngest and so he would have her do deadlifts and they were conscent only and she would have her drop the bar and uh the reasoning for that is is exactly that you're able to get stronger you're not putting on extra muscle mass also it's it's safe it's really very very safe way to train and in programming in programming a protocol for somebody who's not necessarily in that in that boat it's still just for the sake of variety you may want to choose to avoid the avoid The Eccentric on certain days like you're trying to recover accelerate the recovery so you uh lift the weight but then you step down so you could definitely do that eccentric work it's suppos supposedly very helpful to promote hypertrophy but there are a lot of ifs and butts in there I'm going to talk right now about The Eccentric strength work Ecentric work for strength specifically it's very because the muscle is strongest whenever you're lowering the weight it's very easy to uh do something knuckleheaded and get hurt which is Jim Bros do that all the time and instead of doing that what the wise much wiser approach is to get a perfect spotter great competent Spotter and put on after you've done your normal couple of low repetition heavy sets add maybe 5 10 pounds over your maximum and make a perfect eccentric with an intense ion of lifting it so you're lowering this bar that you're just you know the bench press bench press barbell you lowering to your chest and you're loading yourself like you're ready to press it back you pause on your chest without losing tension you're ready to blast it back and then your spotters take it off you and you do this about do this about two three times this uh this sort of a strategy or variation of it was uh us used by reek will he was uh he was able to bench press over 50000 lb wearing a t-shirt uh at a body weight of buak 81 back in the 80s one of the great greatest uh bench pressers who was extremely intelligent about his training and he did the same thing with his heavy attempts as well and incidentally even better not even better I should say you do this in a different day when you combine this this same type of eccentric with a very uh uh con perfect assisted trip not Force Trap like Bros do it's so you bro you know the guy shaking there and dying no so again let's say that your best bench press is you know 315 so you load up 325 you lower it perfectly and you're not and you're lowering at the speed of your uh Max attempt so you're not going very very very slow you know how guys do it they take the first uh quarter of the range of motion very slow and they fall through that doesn't do anything at all no you lower it at that uh rhythm of your maximum weight you pause and then you press it and your training partner gives you enough assistance to make it feel like it's about your 90% so the fact is you're not you get to feel a supera maximum weight but you're not experiencing any psychological stress it's very very powerful and again you do this uh you do this maybe for one or two singles this uh also ties with the Soviet research on gymnast they came up with something called artificial controlling environment so they compared a group of gymnasts that was uh working up to some strength demanding skill with doing typical regressions and at the same time they were also working on um typical strength training weighted pull-ups and so on and the other group would have the coach provide this perfect assistance to enable the athlete to perform the skill at a high level as they put it uh living their motor future motor future but with enough help not to to make it hard but not stressful and the difference in gains were just just just dramatically so much gain so much faster so I would say that would be a very good way to use uh eccentric work uh isometric isometric training calls can also be very powerful for strength and a great value of isometric training is and its ability to coach you to live properly and not just live properly other uh other athletic events as well if let's say that you're trying to learn to throw a front kick and you're doing it you're all over the place but if you place your foot on a wall and if your coach or Sensei positions your body your foot in a certain way and teaches you to start to start applying pressure to that wall and the ground at the same time and kind of a pulse it against the wall adjust your body uh and then you relax shake off your muscles and you go hit the bag and suddenly you're going to do so much better the same thing let's say that you're trying to optimize your uh position for the bottom of the deadlift so you load up more weight that you could possibly lift and then you wedge yourself under and you start applying pressure and it doesn't feel good so you change a little bit so isometrics are very powerful for uh not just for strengthening the sticking points but also for optimizing the angles then we're also dealing with something that um there's also great disinhibition effect so what your listeners might not know is uh so there two you're you have two pedals in your nervous system as and pardon me for telling you this you don't need obviously you know all this but there's the exitation inhibition there's the gas the gas pedal and the brake pedal and there are various influences some of them psychological but not all of them that are taking away from your strength that's called inhibition and under certain circumstances there are documented cases like a lady lifting off the front of a 36 pound 36 100 pound car to save her son and there are documented cases of that so that disinhibition takes place so isometrics does have some disinhibition effects property is very very powerful also isometrics teaches you to uh teaches you not to give up on a heavy attempt because if you put um the experiments were done in a safe manner on the machines obviously but if you put an inexperienced person and uh the machine is moving a slow at a slow rate so when it starts speed starts approaching zero uh that inhibition takes place so pretty much the subject thinks the gig is up I'm not going anywhere that's it I'm done I'm just giving up because I failed but training with isometrics allows you to develop to develop this kind of a neural Drive endurance that you need to grind through safely through a heavier tap so very very powerful how would you incorporate isometrics into it so you can do this uh as a part of your warm-up you can uh also do pause reps they're fantastic it's when you combine combine a eccentric concentric and isometric contraction all in one so perfect Temple for the squat you lower to the parallel and you stay tight and you stay there for 3 to 5 seconds and then you explode upward so that uh that's a great way to train I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor ag1 ag1 is an allin1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're

supply of vitamin D3 K2 with your order of ag1 again go to drink a1.com huberman to claim this special offer I'd like to talk about neural Drive um I attribute you with popularizing maybe you invented it but um certainly popularizing the term like greasing the groove uh in one of your books and by the way we provide links to um Pav's books in the show note captions I'm a collector of your books than I love them um some of them are getting to be collector's items they're a little bit harder to find but you'll have to compete with me on eBay um but some of them can be found elsewhere and we'll provide links uh to those but this notion of greasing the groove complet completely changed my conceptualization of strength training because I was weaned U more or less trying to run cross country during the cross country season only ran it once but I greatly enjoyed it continued that sort of training or trying to put on strength and size kind of a a numb skull young male approach to things but what it served me reasonably well I'm grateful that I included both however I was so tuned to this notion of training a body part creating an adaptation then waiting for the adaptation to occur and then training the body part again you know the arguments are all over the Internet two times a week three times a week and then I came across this concept of greasing the groove which as a neuroscientist felt so intuitively correct and turns out to be correct you'll explain what it is but the idea that more frequent training or practicing of a movement opens up a tremendous number of opportunities for development of strength of size hypertrophy if one wants and I would say just generally more flexibility over one's Total Fitness program once one understands this concept you no longer look at this split or that split or this many reps or that many reps or this volume or that volume oh that is important but you can start to think about it through the lens of the nervous system and to me it was like uh water in a desert to finally encounter something that brought together all these different concepts so could you please explain for people what greasing the groove is and then I think the implications of it will become obvious but we'll also spell out please interrupt me because this is about to become a this might get really long so please interrupt me at any time so first I'll talk about the neural component then we're going to talk about the frequency and the morphological adaptation structural adaptations as it leads so ladies and gentlemen greas the groove we are talking about uh let's use an analogy let's imagine that you are a bow hunter and you work in your garage and then you walk out of your garage and you sho an arrow and you just go back to going about your business just working in your garage or let's say you're a kid who uh who practices martial arts and every on every break between classes you just go in the corner and you practice your kada this is the best way to practice your skill in small portions in a spaced out manner what's really fascinating is um traditional education and traditional strength training it's based on the cramming model so remember cramming for an exam so you're studying at night and you somehow squeak by and you pass it okay great and then a couple days later you happily forget everything so in contrast imagine that you let's say you're studying a foreign language you write words on cards and at every opportunity you're standing in line in the bank so the Lesser Mortals are fooling around on their phones you're just going through your deck like oh can I translate this word I go put it back in the deck flip it over then next time you in some other place you do this again so this is an example of space practice versus the traditional Mass practice and the evidence of the superiority of space practice is just overwhelming it goes back to the 19th century and there's at least like a more than a thousand papers published on that and still very few people do that which is really sad and uh strength is a skill so two interesting things happened in the 50s one is Thomas rash he was an American uh exercise physiologist he proposed that strength adaptation was largely uh largely uh skill and he looked at pretty much the adaptations he noticed that there's no correlation between the muscle growth and strength then uh at the same time as Soviet scientist uh tanov was his last name he was measuring the electrical activity in the muscles of weightlifters who are pressing overhead and back then the Press was one of the competition events and what he found is as the athletes got stronger after some months the emgs started dropping off when they're lifting the same weights so pretty much he found out that the nervous system activity became more economical they were able to try less hard yet still live the same weights or pretty much they they could try harder and lift even heavier weights and hypertrophy could not explain that because in the 50s the Soviets were very anti- hypertrophy they were just doing doubles triples singles pretty much so if we look at what's going on it's uh the heian mechanisms so pretty much every time that you activate a particular connection synaptic connection you know between the neurons that connection becomes uh Stronger so if you do it over and over and over so the grease the groove is the analogy is that command that's coming in from your brain to your muscles that's the groove that's that pathway and the more you use it pretty much the more grease it becomes so it's like becomes a superconductor so in the future you don't have to try as hard to live the same amount of weight or you can try the same amount and you can live it harder so we're not we haven't even addressed the neural drive yet we just pretty much made the Mo neurons more responsive more responsive to it and um it's a very easy and very simple way to train and uh strength comes very easily and very very unexpectedly to make sure that it does happen you have to address uh the issue of specificity so specificity pretty much means without getting too too much into the weeds to get stronger first of all you need to lift weights that are heavy enough and uh if you're looking about percentages of one R Max we're looking at like 75 to 85 typically if you go to light you don't make the impression on your nervous system and it's just not specific enough if you go to heav very quickly you're just going to burn yourself out and uh so pretty much like it's a weight That's Heavy enough to respect and light enough not to fear and second of all and this is very surprising is you only do about half or fewer reps that you possibly could do so for example let's say that you're lifting 80% of your one rep max and let's say that you're able to do eight reps maximum with it that's your that we're just fairly fairly common well you're only going to do about three uh three to four reps per set and that's it and the Jim Bros at this point go crazy like where's the intensity well intensity and strength training is just how heavy the weight is it has nothing to do with the f and it's been proven over and over that that's much more important than how hard you're exerting yourself there are times for that there are absolute times for that but if the weight is heavy enough and if you have the repetitions that you possibly could do you're going to get stronger it's very safe and you're not going to burn out psychologically and it's also very easy on your body so um also that builds muscle as well purely because you're able to do a very high volume of work I'm not able to explain the mechanism why it builds muscle but as the Soviet found out in weightlifting research there's a correlation between the volume and uh Robert troman between the volume and the hypertrophy everything else being equal you're going to get bigger so almost every day you're doing the sets of three four WS maybe even five and they start adding up and before you know it you're stronger and at the same time you have developed muscle so to summarize the grease the groove you're trying to train uh moderately heavy as often as possible while staying as staying as fresh as possible and uh if you decide to do it in the gym a very simple protocol would be a set every 10 minutes it sounds really bizarre like why why why would would you rest for so long this apparently has to do with initial memory consolidation there's so much is still unknown so we do know the G the group works great but we speculate that some of it has to do with some the same phenomena related to uh to learning in other fields so if you're doing something over and over like like you're saying 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus two is four you're just using your short-term memory you're not memorizing anything but if you say 2 plus two is four you go get a coffee you come back and you try 2 + 2 four so there's that desirable difficulty that you have in there and you have to process that instead of just go through the groove that uh that apparently helps helps this adaptation so rest for at least 10 minutes do sets of about the repetitions of half of what you're possibly able to do and you know listen to your body typically train two three days in a row and then take a day off but listen to your body incidentally this Greaser group is the topic of uh my next book I have completed it it's not published yet if if you look at uh I can't pronounce the Hungarian professor's last name chahi thank you thank you I appreciate that so he's talking about that perfect uh challenge perfect practice lies in that channel between boredom and anxiety so if you put yourself in that channel and if you keep lifting this moderately heavy weights with a moderate effort over and over and over you're going to get strong that's one of the many ways to get stronger are you doing anything in the um rest periods between these 10 minutes so is it uh let's say uh bench press um wait 10 minutes till you bench press again but in the meantime you're doing zercher squat 5 minutes after the first bench press that's one of the way to do that you can do up to three exercise three exercises at the same time so let's say like Zer Squad and the bench press and maybe a third thing but I say those two are enough and uh another option is you can do that you can incorporate this into if you do only one exercise you can squeeze it into your lifestyle or your athletic practice so for example uh in uh that's say you're teaching a track uh track uh practice or martial arts class and every 10 minutes on the clock you just have the class do drop and do three hard let's say three one arm push-ups okay and then get back to the class so there's no interference whatsoever in fact it's better than no interference back in the 60s Soviets found out something called the uh strength after effect so if you do strength work that's not exhaust in nature and that's not novel to you it has a tonic effect uh just for any any uh anything that you can do with your brain or with your body anything so what they would even do some coaches they would do soal strength warmup let they would um B up as usual for a track class let's say track practice then they would do let's say three sets of three of something like with 80% Max which is not much and they start they start their practice the then the coach noticed that the athletes are starting to droop a little he'll repeat that you know he might repeat that up to three times so what you have is by having this short very small dose like a nano practice of strength you rejuvenate yourself and your productivity increases so much so whether you want to just do the strength exercise several of them in that one hour period or whether you want to combine that with writing a great American novel that's you know that's your business I suppose if someone has access to the appropriate equipment at home you could incorporate Grease the groove into your entire day that's ideal yes and obviously it's difficult with some equipment but what you could do you could use the heavy duty grippers you could do uh one arm push-ups you could uh uh you could keep a kettle bell under your desk and do press it at at every opportunity and again the idea is really just practice you just try to hit it perfect perfect trap and notice that uh if you have some issues if you're a warm-up dependent person for Orthopedic issues I'm talking about warmup in the very much in the uh body not the mind in this particular case then it might not be appropriate for you although you know with 10- minute rest it might still be okay but uh practicing a skill without the warmup that means rehearsal is very powerful for improving that skill people think they automatically equate performance with improvement with learning but it's not so not at all when you are doing something that's just out of the blue it's uh you know the way a sniper would take a cold shot that's so much harder because you have to produce that solution uh or maybe an example that's closer to most uh viewers GF uh you go to the driving range you start hitting it and like wow you you're amazing you just get yourself fine- tuned you hit you're perfect then uh then you go and you play the game and you cannot replicate that because suddenly different club uh different topography everything's different and you didn't have the luxury of that tuning yourself up right there so it feels it doesn't feel like you're stronger but you are going to get much stronger I've been eager to share with you some recent findings that are not my own but that I think you might be curious about and then I think most people hopefully will be curious about as well it's not greasing the groove specifically but it provides a at least partial mechanistic understanding of how particular types of physical movement with this High motor neuron and attentional engagement can generate high levels of alertness that can be devoted to as you say writing the Great American novel perhaps uh there's a guy at University of Pittsburgh named Peter strick who for the first time started to map the connections between the adrenals and the brain and he was able to do this using some really cool technology the basic takeaway is the following uh adrenaline released from the adrenals as uh some of the listeners may know doesn't cross the bloodb brain barrier but turns out it binds to receptors on the Vegas which then stimulates noradrenaline in the brain and provides this increase in alertness so then the question is how do you get your adrenals engaged you know we can sit here and we can we can do a staring competition which I'll lose um for certain but you know there are all sorts of psychological tools we get you know caffeine Etc there there're all sorts of ways to cold water but it turns out what Peter found was that there are particular locations in the motor cortex that send a two uh basically a two synapse connection D synaptic connection directly to the adrenals and the areas of motor cortex that Engage The adrenals cause them to release adrenaline but just by sheer movement of particular muscle groups are the core as you were talking about before like bracing the core causes the release of adrenaline which then via the Vagas uh causes the brain stem area uh to release nor adrenaline wake up the whole brain essentially increase learning and performance in anything and as well the stronger and stronger activation of the motor neurons deliberate activation of the motor neurons seems to engage adrenaline release now to me this was a wonderful way of um trying to persuade people that they have internal control over this thing that we call motivation that movement itself can increase adrenaline which can increase the tendency to want to move as long as again you don't want to have too much adrenaline either right right and and I'd like to talk about that um but I think I and so many other people were kind of raised and conditioned at least in this country to think oh if I want to increase my level of motivation I need to like um I don't know watch an inspiring video that could be great or I can uh drink caffeine and that or an energy drink and certainly that will do it but to me the the discovery uh that particular movements and particular muscles being engaged in activity itself changes the neurochemical milu I mean of course it had to be right it's a big duh but I think that um anyway I was excited to share with you uh these data I didn't discover them that is new to me so I read The Naked Warrior I was closed when I when I read it um but it's a wonderful book because it talks about body weight um only exercises and this concept of for instance like trying to crush um one's fist on uh you know making a really strong fist on the other side and how that will increase your uh your gripping ability on the other side this kind of thing yes as you know with your background and Neuroscience obviously there's so many uh neurological phenomena like if you can think of like muscle software that we have access to that if we become conscious about accessing that we can be so much stronger yeah so when you talk about you know doing a a set of three or four repetitions or two to three repetitions at about 85% or 80% of one rep mask waiting 10 minutes and then the intervening 10 minutes going and trying to learn something important or physical or cognitive this makes perfect sense to me because of the relationship of adrenaline but also the way that your tire nervous system has changed in the in the intervening period and plus you have the contextual interference so uh one of the Greer group is not something that I invented it's something that I was able to codify and explain and possibly refine but it's been around since the day of Ecclesiastes and uh specifically in strength training Paul Anderson Paul Anderson one of the greatest weightlifters of all time uh he was uh he was a big favorite of the Soviet public you know very tough group to impress but they called him The Wonder of nature he was so strong and uh Paul Anderson would do a set of squats then he would wander around drink some milk half an hour later do a set of presses then go do this again and uh so he reinvent not not should say reinvent no he invented without knowing neurons from Nyland many of the Training Concepts are just Cutting Edge today and again so this concept of contextual interference remember I talked earlier how if it's harder for you to produce a solution if you're trying harder to remember 2 plus 2 is four or how to throw the ball then you're going to learn more as opposed to if somebody just hands it OH 2 plus 2 is four so Paul Anderson had both the spacing time came like so the the groove has been forgotten in the sense of time and the contextual interference he did another exercise that erased whatever previous groove right there and it's uh it's very fascinating how looking at some of these oldtimers and just how how genius s were MH yeah the unconscious genius aspect of it is is so cool and of course I don't want to be disparaging of common um gym programs these days but I do feel like the way that most people train yeah you'll do that yeah the way that most people train in terms of thinking okay I'm going to hit the gym you know three four times a week or I'm going to train chest one day and chest and biceps while that has some value I feel like um for creating all-around strength and hypertrophy there's just such a incredible Treasure Trove of other things that you're sharing with us today that that are just not discussed as much because people don't take the lens of the nervous system component one one thing that I'd love to ask about the nervous system in terms of training adaptation and Recovery is that I was weaned somewhat under the uh thought patterns of Mike mener this was in the Darian Yates era and I knew Mike a little bit I paid for a consult uh with him over the phone we never met in person um so that had my mother asking you know why is this grown man calling our home and why are you wire in the old days you had to wire somebody money so I do um but it was so worthwhile because uh Mike taught me that the goal of training was to induce an adaptation anything additional was not necessary and in his case he he felt was counterproductive very infrequent training Etc and it worked tremendously well to take me from like 150 lbs to 210 lbs which I had no need to do but my body just reacted like crazy but then again I was 16 17 and 18 years old in that time probably could have done any number of different things and and experienced similar results who knows but the concept of course is that you train to induce an adaptation then you rest and then you allow the adaptation to serve the you know moving higher poundages in good form this sort of thing the problem however is that and mener highlighted this is that training of any kind running lifting Etc taxes both the nervous system as a whole and the muscles locally and the connective tissue how should we think about training and recovery so when you describe Grease the groove I could imagine if I had a home setup or I'm going to the the gym I could maybe do four or five rounds of this training but at some point M it becomes counterproductive so um wow a lot of great question I'm just trying to think about how to schedule this sort of thing keeping in mind that the nervous system fatigues as a whole and then there's also the issue of local muscle fatigue or or even the propensity for injury if you just overdo it sure yeah so if we could just Riff on this if you don't mind Andrew I'll break it up because a lot of great questions right there so one as you mentioned there are different ways of training and again uh we the greas grp load parameters apart from the long rests are very much based on Soviet weightlifting system and I'd like to talk a little bit about that later another system that a completely and radically different and it ties very much to Mike menser's training uh for reasons who become obvious is the classic American powerlifting system from the SE from the 80s and uh when people argue about training methods what they need to understand is uh there are many ways to get the job done you know at his research in Estonia found because there's so many different combinations of stimuli and the different different adaptations that result you can arrive to similar outcomes in a lot of different ways so to say this is right and this is wrong you cannot sometimes do that I mean I can say most of things are wrong but I can also say there's multiple right ways of training and they can be radically different and they're different because they rely on very different phenomena so in this particular case you're talking about recovery and frequency which is again a great way address it I'm going to talk about two systems that are completely different and yet have that same pedigree that they have brought so many gold medals so one system is the Soviet weightlifting system is again where athletes would train several times a day and Bulgarian system is a more extreme example of that and every day and the Other Extreme would be the American powerlifting system exemplified by U uh hassid Marty Gallagher Ed Co Kirk kaasi so starting from the 70s through the '90s those a really glorious day for years powerlifting and in that system they would pretty much do one or two heavy sets per lift once a week so it's kind of a little bit like Mike menser's work kind of but not but we we'll we'll address why so how can that be and how can both systems work so you address the recovery there's a concept called heterochronicity which heter means different chronicity refers to time so the different systems in the body to cover recover different rates and if you don't take that into account then uh you're going to have some serious problems so the Soviet system took uh if you look at the Soviet system with frequent training they looked at okay we want to do frequent practice which is exactly what we do we don't want to beat the muscles up so much that they that takes some very long time to recover you know not too much eccentric stress not too much acidosis avoiding things like that uh and they were able to adjust the loads in such a way so let's say your weights are heavy but not too heavy the Reps don't go too high so you're able to recover pretty much pretty much overnight and the benefit of that is it's been shown that if you fragment a given workload over more days over more sessions you get better results and it's uh your body is able and your nervous system endocrine system your carcass everything is able to handle much more if it's split into a small doses so let's use an example of a meal let's say if you're trying to an eating competition how much you can eat in 24 hours so it's not like those Coney Island you know how many hot dogs you can e one sitting no but you would probably eat a lot more if you spread it throughout the day and uh this is the same idea so it's like that Parable from Nim talb about uh the king that got anger in his son and he says he's going to crush him with a big rock and he realize well what did I do I don't want to kill this kid but the king's name King's word is King's word right so he ordered his uh peons to break up the rock into pebbles and then just dumb his pebbles in the kid so that's the same idea so fragmentation the load always is uh allows you to do more and do it safer so something else is related to that in some training systems some training systems rely on adaptations let's say for strength uh that go in the muscle that go beyond just the contracto proteins just you know the part you know my part that make uh that create Force so for example the Soviet system they also tried to increase the storage of creatin phosphate with which is the kind of immediate fuel for for muscle contractions for this type of work we're lifting heavy weights over and over and so by training sometimes easier you're able to keep stimulating that creatin phosphate adaptation but without the still allowing muscles to recover so this kind of a dance and it's fairly complex then on the other hand the American system did something completely different and uh the explanations for what happens in the muscle with this within this American System we don't know for sure but there's a hypothesis by Russian specialist Vasa that's seems quite credible so here's so again the system here's the system you train hard you do one hard set once a week or two hard sets so the satellite cells that are immature cells in the muscle they're sitting there waiting to jump in in you know if you need to replenish the messed up ones in order order for the satellite cells to get their job done they try to figure out scientists try to figure out what sort of a stimuli our or required and one the can a strong case can be made that a very particular damage to the micr structure of the muscle can can provoke that stimulus so but that damage has to be very very specific if you beat up the muscle with a baseball bat you're just going to get a whole lot of scar tissue and you know some satellite cells will just die and others will just be become scar but if the cross bridges in the muscle the cross Bridges is that part that does create force in the muscle if they do tear in a very specific way it seems to do the job so the way the muscle contracts is so there is a imagine that you're rowing a boat on the water so water is one proteins called actin and masin is the the ores that are moving in there so the ore dips into the water Hooks and pools and that ore relies on available energy in the muscle so these uh ATP molecules of you know stored energy they're floating around and the head mein head needs needs that ATP in order to both to hook to produce Force but it also it needs ATP to unhook as well and it's in this in between stage is called a rigor so whenever the muscle has produced Force but there's not enough energy for it to relax so the muscle is stuck in riger so think of riger mortars so if you tear dead body's muscle you know there it's going to tear and supposedly this is going to happen only when you're able to uh when the consumption of ATP is really high in the muscle but the but the supply is not and so if you're if you do that in the first let's say 20 20 30 seconds before acid do is set in that's what that's what should happen because if you wait longer when there's a lot of acid in the muscle acid uh it kills that reaction that uh it kills that reaction that uses ATP so you're not using As Much Anymore sure the the demand is down the supply is down but it's on demand so it's not so good so if you erase that fatigue point so if you try to deplete that caum phosphate that kind of Rocket Fuel of the muscle within about 20 30 seconds then presumably some of these hooks some of these ores are going to get stuck and when the muscle lengthening and they're going to tear and that's a very specific tear it doesn't happen in the outside of the muscle it happens just on the inside in there whether this is true or not I do not know but it's a pretty good theory that does explain Mike menor's method and and explains the uh American powerlifting meth method interestingly about about MK mener and again to the listeners who are not aware of the method that means training Muscle really hard very infrequently with very low volume professor yiv kashki before he died you know famous Soviet Sports scientist known known in the west mostly As the father of what is called petrics in the west and but he's also done many other things as well he spoke very highly about mener he thought mener was brilliant mener was an innovator but many people some people get good results from it like you did and a lot of people do not and uh so pretty much what prasena suggested that might happens is eventually uh you'll reach the limit of adaptation of how much you can deplete how much you can deplete the crean phosphate in that window that's when you hit the wall and this is where the American system comes in this system is called cycling the history of cycling is fascinating the relationship uh the interaction between the Soviet and American strength schools is absolutely fascinating so just to go back for a minute Soviet track athletes in the 50s were using the typical stupid High rep uh High rep reps to burn then in then in the late 50s uh some very sharp young specialist vital chov he uh made a case at a conference what are we doing let's look at what he said let's look at Paul Anderson D hebburn Bruce Randall these North American strength THS let's look what they're doing they're lifting heavy stuff for sets of three to five reps let's knock this down s off soov track athlet started doing that right there so this is how the Soviets for example learned from Americans that's an example of how it went the other way uh the classic periodization as is known mization in which you kind of start out with higher volume and less specific to lower you know to lower volume more intensity and so on that uh periodization is not used by lifters in the Soviet Union lifters thought that's just completely not it's it's just not usable it's just inappropriate for their needs Arad the professor and Olympic champion made very strong case why but Americans who got some limited information about it American powerlifters not weightlifters were able to de during training system based on that premise something that the service didn't do and the way it worked is is like this you don't necessarily have very high volume but you start I'm going to give you a most classic example of this type of cycling again this is again Cassidy Gallagher Cole and Kwasi four weak blocks let's say they're um that there's like going to be three four week blocks maybe four so you do lift once a week on week four you go for a PR so let's say this is a month of fives so this is on your week four you're going to do a PR set of five you plan for it week three is somewhere around your old PR week two is lighter week one is lighter still okay and then after that you may increase the weight but still relative effort is going to drop and you're going to kind of repeat the process so it does multiple things on the muscular level so what Paras explained you pretty much decondition yourself tempor temporarily and you progressively increase that Crea and phosphate use so initially when you decondition it doesn't take as much to get the stimulus you don't have to push really hard in first week you push harder in the second and harder and harder there's a concept uh their Concept in uh periodization so Sport Science of react it versus resistance reactivity means how responsive your body is to the stimulus and resistance kind of like in the medical terms you know how much it can you know it it's uh it's not affected by it so when you're starting light after a layoff your reactivity is high and your resistance is low it doesn't take much so boom sudden you build this muscle and then you can building up and when you reach when you reach a peak then you just then you just uh step back again and uh on the side of the nervous system and endocrine system much later Soviet research they said you can train hard maximum two weeks out of four that's it more than that you cannot handle so for every month you're training two weeks hard the other ones you're cruising you're not as hard sometimes easy sometimes uh there are different ways of programming it the typical one that you hear about in the west as you're kind of build things up for three weeks and then down in four it's one of about 16 different possible Arrangements doesn't have to be there can be um here's one brilliant way uh Franco Colombo who uh passed unfortunately was not just a great bodybuilder he was a great chiropractor and great strength athlete super strong very strong and Brilliant so he told me about one his deadlift cycle week one moderate week two heavy week three moderate week four very heavy again this is different way of arranging the same concept and these American powerlifters were able to build a system that built the muscle probably exactly in this manner what was happening at the same time oh yeah and there's also another angle how that system possibly has worked this is fascinating any type of exercise that you do uh makes your muscles more slow twitch it's just the way it is it's very very bizarre yeah even explosive even explosive even just trying to crush the bar and drive the deadlift up even that the more you do it so gold spin's research back in the 80s that any cycle of stretching or contraction resets the uh heavy chain mein you know the contracto proteins that makes it towards slower time so any type of work if you do biopsy on somebody who is a couch potato you're going to find that person probably has a higher uh concentration of white fibers than you and I wild very counterintuitive very counterintuitive and uh so that's like a default setting for the fibers however if you take time off uh it something changes and it changes be it goes beyond the change so this uh this research came some out of Sweden I believe when they trained a group of subjects and strengths they saw a predicted decrease in the ratio of type 2x fast f fibers then they took a couple months off and then they experience they called it MHC overshoot m in heavy heavy chain again like Fast fiber overshoot so they had something like 70 more per uh fibers after that wild nobody takes two three months off these days and but they figured out vasansi figured out that is not needed for athletes because obviously you get de conditioned in other ways right so remember we talking about het heterochronicity different processes take place at different rates so it's like you're constantly playing the whack the mole so this is is getting out of shape but this is not recovered yet it's it's a game that's that's a game of uh training programming so in the American system first of all the infrequent training it reduced the stimulus for the conversion of the fibers towards towards a slower isopor slower types and the second all the taper that they did later so suddenly switching for five to like one triple one double for a few weeks if you do that for just a few weeks you're do like a one triple one double you're not going to lose muscle mass because it really takes over a month but there's enough time for the uh for the myin to configure itself to a faster time so that's probably what happens interesting and neurologically I think what happens probably they exerted themselves very strongly once uh once twice a month so it's again you know neural Drive probably with strength and disinhibition and other things like that and the irony is the system has lost its popularity some records in deadlift like Dan Austin's record and possibly NAA said back in the 90s and 80s there's oh yeah Lamar Gant Lamar Gant is this is the strongest deadlifter pound perp pound in history so like 683 at Buck 32 or something like that and it was done back in the 80s so he trained that way done Austin in other lifts records have increased in part because of the equipment changes and some other reasons but uh at cone dominated the platform for decades and so there are some great great lifters who train this way but then the system lost his popularity for reasons have nothing to do with its Effectiveness it doesn't mean it's appropriate for everybody though because train a lift once a week for one or two sets there's not much practice and that's a problem so unless you're training under a very high level coach or you're already coming in with great skills it's really good second if you need any kind of level of endurance or if you're playing other sport you're going to be very sore from this type of training so it's a great system for certain type of people I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need but nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium all in the correct ratios but no sugar proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it extremely easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on high hot days when I'm sweating a lot and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element they have watermelon Citrus Etc frankly I love them all and now that we're in the winter months in the northern hemisphere element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock I really like the chocolate flavors especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up so you put it in hot water and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate especially when it's cold and dry outside when hydration is especially critical if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman to claim a free

red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light sources have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cell and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing improvements in acne reduced pain and inflammation even mitochondrial function and improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the juv whole body panel about three to four times a week and I use the juv handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try ju you can go to juv spelled jv.com huberman Chu is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off Chu products again that's ju spell jv.com huberman to get up to $400 off based on what you just told us about Franco's training and and the rest seems that shorter training Cycles might be ad vantageous even just conceptually and and practically like I I've tended to break up my year into 12 to 16 week training Cycles been doing that for a long time and now that I'm 49 this is the year that I decided I was going to start modifying my training a bit because certain little things aren't working for me as well okay um you might laugh I'm actually curious whether or not you'll laugh or approve um I switched at some point to uh using the belt squat these belt squat platforms I just feel like that you may want to explain it yeah the belt squat is essentially you stand on a plat form so you're on uh unfortunately you're on display for everybody there but that's not why I do it you step up onto a platform sometimes it's called a pit shark Rogue makes a Bel uh belt squat there are other ones of course have no relation to any of those companies and you wear a big thick um lifting belt but it's kind of sagging in the front and then you uh as if you were going to attach a weight to it but you attach yourself to usually it's a cable or a um or a lever between your legs sounds scary but that lever or cable can drop below the level of the platform you're standing on and you can load up quite quite a bit of weight on this what I love about it is um you can get uh very vertical if you want or just a little bit of forward tilt because you can place your fingers on the on the handles you can grip them if you like the point being there's a lot of degrees of freedom in terms of stance and um I like that you're not loading the shoulders true I I you know I don't want to sound like a wuss but I'll do it um you know I I moved from standard squats back squats to front squats then to hack squats and then now I've been um playing around a lot with uh the belt Squat and really enjoying it because you can go really deep you can blast out of the bottom position you can load up lots of plates on there if you have the strength to do so without the feeling that you're just compressing your whole spine um or worrying about dropping the weight so I'm enjoying working with it I love your thoughts on Belt squats true um but in general I I am hearing you and I'm thinking that moving away from this uh 12 to 16 week Cycles is going to be advantageous because what I'm finding is that it's hard to account for Life events in that way and and plan training and travel and all this but four weeks is kind of a manageable thing this month this is what I'm going to do and of course the months work together the body doesn't know the difference between February and and March as it were well in California it doesn't places it do it does right exactly the seasonal Cycles are real elsewhere um but I'm thinking shorter training Cycles might might be a a strong conceptual and practical framework um and um yeah I'd love your thoughts on both of those the belt squat or a a leg work that's non-spine compressing MH and uh shorter training Cycles as a general theme that people might think of incorporating into their training the belt Squat and this leg work that's not spine compressing I'm going to address healthy people like yourself so if somebody has medical restrictions you got to Belt Squad because the doctor says so that's what you got to do as long as you're also addressing the rest of your posterior chain as long as you're training your lower back your upper back obviously your neck which obviously you're doing that and in some other manner there's absolutely no problem with that so let's say you're doing some shrug pools or something you got that taken care of or you're doing some deadlifts and also for powerlifters what powerlifters do it's a tactic is uh when you're training the same lift especially if you train the same lift very frequently there is always that that heterochronicity something's not catching up quite as fast so you're going deadlifting and uh your hands are beat up use straps you know or you come into the deadlifting and your back feels like well it's time to deadlift my back my back is not quite ready well you could go do a neuros Sumo or something like that so there are ways of modifying things this way so you're able to if let's say you hit some hard deadlifts or hard squats and you need some additional leg work sure you don't need any extra stimulation for your upper back and midb however if you are a person who has more of a minimalist who does fewer exercises then you just can't afford that because then you're going to have to do some additional exercises you're going to do something else so may I suggest for your listeners and viewers to do zercher squats again a fantastic exercise it does not beat up your shoulders it does not build up your elbows or your wrists it may leave some bruises you know but it's okay you can live with that and uh does that answer with the Bell squat yeah and by the way machines in general here's also very interesting observation about machines machines are very Ed use ful for advanced trainees and uh fairly useless for beginners oh I love that you said that I barely touched machines early on in my training I dare I say call it a career but I've been doing it for more than 30 years so I'll call it a uh a stage of yeah it's a decent run um but if you imagine but imagine the scenarios what people do what do people do oh it's safer get in climb into this machine right there you're not developing any stabilizer so you get out of this machine you get crushed somewhere but on the other hand if you are more if you're more uh Advanced lifter so like you know Marty Giger one of the top powerlifting coaches in the world he might recommend leg presses in a very specific deadlift stance to a lifter and uh this is going to increase strength on your leg drive without beating up your back but you're already doing your deadlifts you can definitely do that so Advanced lifters may make a good use of machines and they don't need to be taught how to do that they can figure it out but beginners really should just use exclusively free weights I'm not saying everybody should do Squad bench deadlift kettle bell snatch and this and that no there's a large menu of exercise to CH choose from but you got to choose just from that menu where you discover the weight that's free that's truly truly free uh should we move on to the cycle shorter cycle yeah the shorter cycle a lot of it depends on the type of programming that you do so the type of agression that you use so if I may may I step to the side on that so in strength training you can look at the typical linear progression we just progressively increase the weight it only works for beginners obviously you look at the wave progression where you know you're going up for a while then backing off and then going up again and interestingly enough in this classic American Cycle there's a wave there even though the weights keep going up every week but if you uh if you did a set of five with 500 pounds on on the fourth week of your fives and then you went to 520 for triple 520 for triple is a lot easier so there's a D Lo built in there just people don't realize it so it is a form of wave loading as well then there's also the step loading step loading is a very interesting way of going about it and I believe it's the preferred programming choice for do it yourself people who not necessarily aspire to records but want to train in a very simple Manner and step loading pretty much means where you start out it's kind of like reverse think of George castanza approach to uh Progressive overload right so it's like regressive overload do the opposite instead of starting light and going heavier start fairly heavy and then stay with it and then stay with it and stay with that until it becomes fairly fairly light and then increase in that casee you're staying this longer so that's a good approach for Less experienced people more exp there are limitations Advanced athletes run into limitations of this method and finally there's variable overload which is what's used in the Soviet weightlifting system and later in Russian powerlifting and there's no progression there at all it is just based on pure appur adicity irregularity so it's like imagine muscle confusion but the smart kind and nervous system confusion where it lows Whiplash like at least 20% every time in volume from session to session or week to week and excis are changed and so on so there's no progression whatsoever so if you're using a fairly conventional linear or wave progression the shortest cycle is generally a good idea at least for older lifters like in uh using the American powerlifting experience older lifters uh with came back at Ernie France Rick crane Rick crane especially who passed recently unfortunately so they were observing how a an older lifter can't afford to start as light because he stop losing ground too much and he can't afford to go as heavy as well or not for long so they pretty much switched to Shorter Cycles something like eight eight week Cycles even possibly six week Cycles so it's uh it's a legit it's a legit approach but there are many different ways obviously because you looking at the at the big picture you kind of have to look at it uh you know from up close and from and from afar but overall I'd say yes if uh for older and more experienced lifters it's a it's a good idea great most people I think who do resistance training these days uh would like to also have some degree of cardiovascular fitness in fact I think one of the great things that's happened in the last 5 to 10 years is that most everybody men women we can talk about kids and kid training but um adult men and women thinking about muscle the importance of having muscle and being strong in particular as part of their longevity and health this is a great progression that's so very different than when I was growing up where the only people at least in American gyms that lifted were preseason uh football players uh bodybuilders and maybe a few other you know uh Niche groups but now things have really changed earlier we were talking about what um you know why the Soviet system and uh training for strength is has been the tradition and here why things are just so different in how we conceptualize resistance training and I'll just go out on a limb and say what I believe and have thought for a long time which is that what screwed up everything in terms of people's conceptualization about how to use resistance is bodybuilding that you know I mean no knock against people that want to make bigger muscles that was a screw up number one yeah that was yeah it it seems to be that the idea is you know you go to the gym multiple times per week you get a pump I mean notion of the pump like it always feel it feels aversive to me not the pump itself but when people talk about it it just feels a little inappropriate like let's get a pump like it just feels weird when people say that in any event um but this whole notion of just flushing the the the uh the muscle with blood and getting it to you know sure you get some window into your potential future self if you go home and and eat a bunch of food and sleep but somehow it it's so um unathletic sure in its approach and I have friends who've done competitive bodybuilding and that sort of thing not too many but so I I've have respect for the sport at some level but I feel like the way it's spilled over into quote unquote gym culture has um done equal harm and good and and what I like so much about your work is that it's really about strength as a skill strength as an asset for longevity yeah um and I guess when I think about somebody who wants to be strong somebody who wants to be healthy I also have to ask should people be training for for strength and endurance like the two opposite ends of the spectrum because it seems to me that would be the answer great question as opposed to what most people do which is hey I'm going to go to the gym maybe I'll push a sled and then I'll I know I'll do some kettle bell swings and then I'll also do some pull-ups and then I'm you know I'm GNA like take a picture of my tricep in the mirror I mean it just seems like while it's better than doing nothing yeah it's clearly not making America that much healthier um and I just think there's such a vast landscape of opportunity in training for strength and endurance but they seem at such odds with one another for most people so maybe we could just kind of throw up on the on the Whiteboard here this notion of training to get strong strength as a skill strength as something that's valuable for longevity I think we touched on that a little bit earlier and then endurance the ability to carry two suitcases to the airplane without coughing up along at the end also the ability to take a hike with your partner or your kids maybe actually have a backpack on your back and not have to stop every 50 Paces just being a fit overall person which one forgive me for the duration of this question but when when travels to Europe I haven't spent too much time in Eastern Europe but when you get over to uh you know Switzerland or Austria you see people who are strong and they have endurance I mean I imagine a sherpa is strong with endurance as well right by the way sherpers are really messed up their mitochondria are truly messed up this is a excessive hypoxia it's very interesting their metabolism is quite severely anerobic it's very weird Oh weird they're the markers of oxidative stress is is really really high but sorry that's off topic no no we can touch on that because it's interesting people who live at altitude and uh up to a certain point Danver is good the Himalaya is not good okay well yeah I have Scandinavian relatives and and um you go to Denmark or or Sweden or Norway and you just look at these people are so healthy their posture is great they're strong and they're not spending a lot of time in gyms sometimes they are so what's going on in terms of strength and endurance and maybe how bodybuilding and this no of building muscle has perhaps um caused some issues that we need to help people reconceptualize once again several great questions let's talk about bodybuilding and then before getting to endurance uh what you said it's it's absolutely true but I'd say that's there are different types of bodybuilding if you look at bodybuilding historically it was guys were strong I've had the honor of knowing some uh Golden Age Arab bodybuilders like Franco Coloma and Dave Draper and Clarence bass and these guys were formidable they were not just uh pretty boys they were absolutely extremely strong so I think something happened in the culture where bodybuilders stopped stopped valuing strength some bodybuilders there's still there's still a number of guys out there who are following traditional method and are strong also interestingly enough the Bro split you know hit once a mus a muscle once a week it's not necessarily bad if you again follow more of a into this classic American powerlifting model so instead of training three times a week you train five you know in addition to your squad day deadlift day bench day you can have shoulders day and arms day and whatever but you go heavy you know look at reg Park you know with his uh sets of five and if you focus if you emphasize this medium reps and again Soviets eventually came to the conclusion that um for strength you should stick in the one to six repetition range and you shouldn't do a lot of singles and doubles threes and fours should predominate but fours and especially fives and sixes this is where you get both hyper Trant strengths that's that beautiful combination and fives have a great tradition American powerlifting as well if you train with fives you're going to get muscle and you're going to get strengths and you're not going to complicate things so there are some bodybuilders out there who train in this particular Manner and they're fantastically strong just not many of them unfortunately but I also would like to add that there's another influence that messed things up I would take the Bros of the '90s with a big bench press and the chicken legs to these guys who standing balls and juggle oranges and what whatever the hell they're doing I I mean this uh the idea is so there's the concept of neuroplasticity which obviously you know so much more than I about that that's always throwing her out oh you need variety and so they throw every circus trick at the uh at these poor clients and by I use the word clients purposefully like at strong first at our school of strength we have students because haris lot of clients but in that world they're definitely clients well today you're going to stand on one foot and then you're going to pull on this cable and then tomorrow you're going to kneel and you're going to do this kind of thing while asymmetrical loading and uh symmetry are absolutely something that's needed under certain condition you need to do it in a professional way like if you look gray cook gray Cooks work gray will tell you just get yourself symmetrical and start lifting instead of uh Reser to this unlimited uh What uh colleag of mind Mark riing called randomx of variety so I'd say that's the other there way too many choices and when there are no constraints when everything's available you go to a store everything's available you don't know what to pick and you can stick with that so that's that's a very big problem I would say so I would say the less time people spend on the internet unless you know you're looking up research papers or doing something else valuable or fine watching a good movie that's all right so unless you're looking up a research paper or watching a movie forget about it or your podcast or my website that's it the rest of it is off limits but strength and endurance uh endurance is a very broad term and if we talk about let's talk a little bit about training for athletes for endurance and let's talk maybe a little bit for the general population we're trying to do for health and again for just going for a hike so the endurance of being able to do triathlon or Swim a very long distance the adaptations are primarily taking place in the slow fibers and you have some very specific uh adaptations to the capillaries and the mitochondria so many things but in a very specific way and that's not going to help you let's say if you're a fighter it's happened over and over where a guy who's been uh marathoner he takes up MMA MMA and he starts getting gassed really rapidly because while he has uh his slow fibers can keep going forever but not at the intensity that's required for this particular sport so and also we're talking about there's endurance that's peripheral and Central so you're talking about obviously your heart you're talking about your lungs you're talking about the plumbing but then you're also talking about the extraction and use of the oxygen which is huge and it's totally different it can be trained with the same methods but adaptations are very different so then when people realize that oh let's start smoking these MMA guys in Marsh larts guys and BJJ guys let's just make them puke and that's going to improve the endurance and it does improve their endurance but a very high cost so in the sovet sport Science there's a term the cost of adaptation comes from Felix me Professor he was a well re a cardiopathy or but later again his re research and stress is amazing so there's the cost of adaptation and it's the same thing is uh pretty much as buying buying a car or table you can get the same table for for a lower price or you can pay the top dollar so you can increase your strength while at the same time blowing your back out or you can increase your V to Max while uh getting arisma in the process or you can do it in the healthy way so one of the issues you have to look at the trying to lower the biological cost of the adaptation so in strength training we do that by very careful and not training hard too often so again the American system it's two weeks out of four the Soviet system pretty much the same although the planning the planning is going to be different first if we look at the cardiovascular adaptations the before before we looking into the um into the mitochondrian and into the muscle most of the work should be done below the threshold pretty much so what's the threshold so for Runners let's say you're running and you you're able to maintain the conversation and when you start running too fast and you cannot maintain the conversation you pass the threshold it's like you're going faster and you're breathing harder linearly and suddenly it goes like this like a hockey stick so at that point your body is no longer able to uh process all that acid and uh things are starting to get hard so there are certain implications there are certain implications for your muscles for sure we'll discuss that in a few minutes but for your heart there are two things we're primarily trying to train one we're trying to train the stroke volume so pretty much how much uh blood the heart can pump out with each contraction and it's very simple thing to do you get up to like um you know 70 to 70 to 85% uh of your maximal heart rate so the heart starts stretching literally so so this blood is incoming and the Heart starts stretching and it's requires volume some uh to defon Riders they might throw the uh throw the food in the back of the cycle and they write all day because that's what they've got to do and that's requires that adaptation for people who just do for health you don't need to do that much you know 3040 minutes several times a week is enough but for a high level you have to stretch the heart if you start redlining the heart rate the heart starts twitching so there's no time for it to uh to to fully to fully relax and stretch you're no longer really increasing your stroke volume and what you're doing right now you're strengthening your ejection fraction which is like the strength of the heart which is needed for athletes whose sport require red lighting heart rate you know if you're fighter if you are a 400 meter Runner you absolutely need to do that but what they found it went back to German research going to decades later and then the sovet research if um you start lining your heart rate before you have that volume that you put in and built up the stroke volume you're just heading for pathology so there are arism there's all sorts of different things that that the aibs all sorts of things that can start happen that are bad and also your performance is not going to be very high because again your stroke volume is not there and even for athletes who do that they should do it for a very short period of time it's just too stressful and it's just not needed typically it's a peak it's peaking phase for some weeks before leading up to the competition so pretty much steady state steady state I uh exercise like riding a cycle or jogging or hiking when you're still able to talk it's the best most efficient and healthiest way to to promote that quality when you're increasing your heart stroke volume if you decide to get a little more intense at some point interval training is appropriate but unfortunately it's completely and totally messed up and misunderstood it's like a catch all term high intensity interval training and uh Brent rashal a professor out of San Diego said this is nonsense this term is a nonsense what does it even mean like what's high intensity and also here's a question what does low intensity interval training mean uh going back to taking a taking a a step to the side but that's discussion will help us when we discuss what happens in the muscle terminology so there are different rest periods between sets there is uh there is the ordinary rest period so which means you pretty much recover your function it's like you're just as strong or just as enduring as as from the previous set there is the um uh suprax rest period when you if you rest extra sometimes you get some extra performance out of it and uh there is this stress rest period when the next set is going to be harder your performance may or may not be compromised but it's going to be harder so with ordinary stress ordinary rest periods that is called in track is called repeat training you know so you run 100 meters then you rest for you know whatever 10 15 minutes as long as you need longer possibly then you repeat it again and your performance stay this way interval training again it's established that just means that things are going to get worse from set to set so that's the definition of interval training the irony is the interal training was designed to increase the intensity of EXC size while reducing the demands on the body so if you look at the works of work of uh Fox and Edwards uh their uh pioneers of internal training in United States they give some great examples so let's say you're running for 30 seconds and you're at this speed and you're going to produce this much acid and your heart rate is going to be this High well if you run for 10 seconds with short periods in between at the same speed you're going to produce a lot less acid and your heart rate is not going to climb to the stratosphere here and uh that typee of training is very very useful and interal training can be used for promoting any type of adaptation you can use it for uh hypertrophy so here's uh here's one Training Method I learned from my colleague Fabio zonin it was designed by Professor Mason in Italian Mr Universe and Professor okay you take 80% of your W rep max so let's say presumably a trap Max set of five rest for 30 seconds set of five rest for 30 seconds if you cannot do it anymore you're done and then you come back maybe 10 minutes later do it again that's an example of interval training again I see and you can structure interval training to uh for adaptations within the muscle a mitochondria and you can also do that for your heart so here's how you do it for the heart today there are a lot of fancy popular protocols but all you have to do is go back to what Germans did many decades ago here's the premise your vegetative system your heart your lungs your plumbing uh they have inertia so uh for example imagine yourself as a kid you run really really hard you know you run for you know 100 meters or something or less maybe and everything's fine and then you're talking to your body and something you start sucking with so that's an example of uh of this inertia so if you get your heart rate up to about 85 to 90% One reped Max and then you suddenly switch to jogging you don't want to stop because that's just way too way too hard for your heart without getting that Venus return from muscles working what happens is uh the heart slows down but there's that blood keeps on moving and the blood literally stretches the walls of the heart I see so Sprint perhaps uh 100 200 300 400 meters and then jog back traditionally it was not quite a Sprint the duration would be typical 60 to 90 second uh the intensity is such that you get to top off at 85 90% of your heart rate Max something like that and then you jog until your heart rate goes goes to about 60 70% so that's roughly about the same probably and uh that to look things up it's like German interval training that was done it is based on very definite physiological events like this is what the heart does this is we're trying to do with the heart and is a instead of inventing some things that are simply trash the body for no reason whatsoever and part of the problem also Andrew is it's very easy to get uh misled by quick gains so uh and it happens in strength world and in endurance world let's uh let's remember uh the the years when you and I and every other male listener bench press their Max once a week MH you're strong next week you're stronger third week you're stronger like you're doing the math you're doing the math like okay well I should be setting the National Record by Christmas and maybe be going to the worlds by by summer and then at six weeks you're done and for experienced athletes happen sooner like after three weeks the same thing with endurance when you start doing glycolytic work when you start redlining heart rate and increaseing the acides your performance jumps so quickly it's very contagious it's like oh not contagious pardon me it's very exciting and you think that you're going to keep going forever but you really absolutely will not so for if you want to train for if you want to train uh your heart a good way of doing that is steady state work if you decide to do some sort of intermittent intermittent work there are several different ways one is um intermittent exercise that's more of a repeat in nature not interval which is very bizarre to people let's say that you go moderately hard hard for 10 seconds you go easy for 10 seconds and you do this for 30 to 60 Minutes imagine doing that that's good work it is good work but you know what to be shocking to you that you're not going to produce that much as or you're not red line your Redline your heart rate better would be like like 10 seconds of work 20 seconds of rest that that would be a fascinating research that sweds did back in the 50s and 60s on that it's amazing if you keep the work periods short uh you're able to not produce a lot of acid but just go very very hard and you're going to be able to uh train your heart and your lungs in this manner too you can also do and you also have peripheral adaptations in the muscles mitochondri and so on vascular some capillarization happening too but you know it's also interesting there's one particular type of I hate the fact that it falls onto the high intensity interal training umbrella because it's not because everything that sounds like hit it's not good to me because it's just made up label but there's one type of training that delivers great benefits to your uh cardiorespiratory system and at the same time it also does that for you know for your mitochondria and even builds muscle in the same time in track it is called glycolytic Power repeats and in uh the last 20 years there are several good papers that were done on that uh dybala Burg master I think pardon me if I'm mispronouncing their names but pretty much you do a wind gate like a 30 seconds of Hard Exercise followed by approximately five minutes of rest and you repeat it several times here's what's unique about this this type of method it gets your heart rate up to about that 85 85 90% or something then you're going to walk it off after that so you are going to get adaptations for your heart it's not the most effective way but it's uh for healthy people it's a healthy way and it's a very efficient way at the same time we'll discuss later what happens in mitochondria level but also what's interesting you're also likely to get build some muscle as well and uh typically there is the conflict which we're getting to this point about like strength versus endurance typically there's the conflict of strength versus endurance because you know if you're looking in the uh mour on one side ampk on the other side things seem to be like okay this is pulling one way this is pulling the other way but somehow this particular load while promoting peripheral and Central endurance also uh endurance at least in the fast in the fast and intermediate fibers also does promote muscle growth interesting and what sort of exercise this is not Sprints this would be kettle bell swings for instance in in the studies that were done they use wind Gat they use cycle they cycled sprinting if you are a going uphill you could certainly do that this 30 seconds is hard you're you're pushing you're pushing yeah uh going in a track it's too easy to get something messed up so going uphill you can do that we do the with skettle bells we did this work in my first skettle Bell school over 20 years ago where we would do a set of you take a heavy kettle bell moderately heavy kettle bell like you know for you know for you or me to be like a 70 pounder and we would snatch it really hard for a set of 20 25 reps and then we just jog the heart rate comes down and then we take this leisurely powerlifting rest and we're going to do it again and it's a fantastic way to promote uh various uh aspects of Fitness so you're going to get cardiorespiratory endurance you're going to have get peripheral adaptations endurance in the muscle and you're also building muscle at the same time the reasons for that here's the theory again all we all the conversations we have about this is what happens in the muscle all these are theories we we know pretty much if we do X we're going to get get you know Z whatever or Y some kind of result at this point but we may not necessarily know for sure so the following is another one of the theories but it's another good credible one so this is Professor Victor sanov so according to him the preconditions for muscle growth in addition to the obvious like food and food and things and hormones so when you reach a certain level of acidosis only a certain level level of acidos is not necessarily very high that those hydrogen ions will make the membrane permeable to the hormones so they're going to enter and go into the nucleus and start doing their job so that's one of the part of the explanation then at the same time also the free creatin when creatin phosphate that hot fuel gets burnt off that's also anabolic for one reason or another so there are some explanations whether that's how it is or not I don't know but the fact is doing a hard 30 40 second set followed by a very generous rest we're talking about 5 10 minutes and repeating it five times possibly more it it works very very well I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available now I've spoken before on this podcast with several expert guests on nutrition about the fact that most of us should be getting one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every single day now not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also for your overall metabolism and health eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to Stave off hunger and reduce sugar Cravings one of the key things however is to make sure that you get enough quality protein without ingesting too many calories Maui Nei venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that getting one gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories also Mau new venison is extremely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth they also have a terrific venison jerky that's super convenient I probably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak every once in a while and I'll snack on the jerky whenever I need extra protein and I don't have time for a full meal right now Maui Nei is offering hubman podcast listeners a limited collection of my favorite cuts of Venison and their products it's perfect for anyone looking to improve their diet with delicious highquality protein supplies are limited so make sure to go to mauu venison docomond to get access to this highquality venison today again that's mauw venison docomond what should I do during my rest periods all right well first of all whenever heart rate is high the very first thing is to not to suddenly stop because uh you want to uh there are valve oneway valves in the veins that whenever you contract the muscles of the legs they help to milk the blood back through to the heart so basically they reduce the stress on the heart so just walk it up first the first step if if your heart rate was high uh then the second thing is you want to do exercises you want to do relaxation myo relaxation muscle relaxation exercise what they are is if you watch boxers how they you know shake off their shake off their shoulders and drop drop their hands and do things like that these exercises go back to the 30s Soviets used them since the 30s and they used them with Elite athletes uh kids in grade schools and everybody so these exercises serve several uh functions one is if you are doing an exercise that is strength exercise in nature some of the Cross bridges are stuck pretty much and so your muscle is thick atropic it's like gel so by moving your muscle in a passive manner you get you get it unstuck and so you restore circulation obviously and uh the other reason is again control of muscular tension is very very important it's important to learn how to contract the muscle for strength it's very important how to relax for uh speed for endurance just for a happy life if you look at the best sprinters note how relaxed their faces are when they're on their jaws relax how relaxed their necks are so relaxation is something that's practiced just like tension so regardless of what exercise that you just did shaking off we call this fast and loose drills sh taking like passive like turn your muscles to Fat so you want to do this for a little bit then after that uh it it depends how long is your rest so if you're taking a and depends what exactly that you're doing in some extreme examples let's say that you're a sprinter let remember we talked like doing Sprint repeats with let's say 100 meters in 15 minutes you think wow sounds like a great great training session well the problem is these guys do need these 15 minutes to get the acid out of the system and have some other functions to recover but after a couple minutes the CNS excitability goes down mhm so what the Soviets figured out back in the 40s still is what you do then after you walked it off after you shook it off you hear and there you insert some very kind of like a light and easy hops or whatever using the same muscle groups so these poor athletes really have a complicated dress protocol there's really no no rest for the wicked there if you are a lifter who taking very long rest periods in between let's say you take those 10 minutes then after your heart rate is down and after you show cough and after you walk to the L can just sit down you can do whatever you want do not sit a slouch because obviously stum Mill explained why that's not a good idea and speaking of slouching one reason that a Runners get their backs jacked up after running or some endurance event is again they go into their knees and they you know get into that collapsed posture and uh their discs are really pliable and warm after the run and then suddenly put them into flexion and they get messed up so yeah you also got to like you point out to watch our posture but you really got to watch your posture during recovery because you slump between your sets of squats and then you know you could blow something out right there interesting I used to think that I would this recurring sort of lower back hip thing that I finally feel is under control and I used to think that it correlated with travel and something about maybe not sleeping as well and traveling perhaps but what I've noticed is even if I just sit too much after training my legs hard I end up with this back issue so just moving to standing desk configuration after training legs irrespective of travel has really helped and I think um I mean nowadays there's all this excitement about walking I don't know if you you know I don't know how much time you spent on social media but like walking is the new thing for 2024 you know people discovered walking to lower you know postmeal blood glucose I mean all stuff that was great thing to do um we'll see what happens in 2025 what the what the new and I'm I'm a fan of walking but um no small part because it just feels like it loosens up everything after training and I like to train early in the day if possible and I know it's a a dramatic reduction and kind of aches and and and strains as a the thing you can do I remember when I watched your podcast with uh Stu McGill you mentioned that uh the um upward facing dog Cobra or Cobra helps you right putting yourself an extension into extension so for people who for whom that works it's uh you can just lie on the LIE on the floor in your elbows and just read a book so for example add strong first uh courses when people do exercise and then we teach them so we have several authorized postures so you either have to sit ram rod straight you know you can sit in the Lotus or SE out or something like that or uh you can you know half kneel still upright or you can lie on your stomach so we do not allow this this collapse posture because this is a great great way to get hurt plus you know you look like a slacker when you're slacker mentally you're not going to be focused on whatever you're supposed to be doing so I think that's I think that's a good idea and to bring us back to do you want to talk a little bit about the peripheral adaptations from endurance okay and then maybe we can talk about like what should people uh what should people do who are not athletes so a much bigger thing than the V2 Max is the adaptations the ability of your muscles to extract and use the oxygen so this again call this revolution anti-glycolytic revolution comes from also yanski again he's known as the father of Plyometrics but he's so much more than that and back in 1980 he looked at the typical endurance training protocols and he says okay everything everybody's trying to push the athlete to the greatest degree of discomfort and make the athlete a custom to that degree of discomfort and he says that that's just wrong instead we need to figure out how to postpone the fatigue and how to fight the mechanism that produce the fatigue and it says glycolysis anerobic glycolysis is the primary cause of that we could split a lot of hairs whether it's uh you know it's the glycolysis itself or it's uh the acid from coming from ATP breakdown or whether it's uh n organic phosphates or whatever but whatever it is it always happens when the acid dosis is running High when acid becomes high so that doesn't really matter which which exact U exact factor is so he figured out you need to promote aerobic metabolism in the working muscle fibers so he decided that endurance training for for high level athletes and people who are not athletes it will apply to you as well has to be specific that's exactly why like that uh that Marathon R who joined the m& MMA class and then sucking wind his endurance is totally not specific here's an example of uh specific endurance is where you're using the same muscle fibers that in your sport and in the mode that's consistent with that sport so vasansi would have people like skiers for example do this very long push off on the ski and then Glide push off and glide and uh yeah suan of who came after him so an example of that you have this really powerful contraction of the muscles that are used in your sport and then there's that relaxation during which the muscle recovers is it's my globin oxygen that there's a small amount of oxygen in the muscle and it requires that creating phosphate fuel that is used for the short term so pretty much instead of relying on that acid producing metabolism glycolytic metabolism that you start using on one hand to use lifter metabolism you know creatin phosphate that's what fuels uh you know a set of three reps and on the other using this Marathon runers aerobic metabolism so you're like putting glucolysis in a visce and a great example of that comes from bosanski is not the only one who came up with this idea it's being reinvented by others so in boxing Leon Spinx to the viewers who don't know who he is Leon Spinx or a professional boxing world champion and uh he defeated Muhammad Ali amongst among others so he's a great champion and he hired uh arth lyard who's a great running coach from New Zealand to work in his conditioning and lyard had him do work in the heavy bag for an hour and a half to two hours Non-Stop and he says no of course you're not going all out sometimes harder but you're definitely not tapping the bag you're not Shadow Boxing and so if you're putting your muscle fibers in a very specific metabolic window and do it over and over and over that uh they start adapting to it fast fibers start developing mitochondria fast fibers start developing capillaries fast fibers don't lose their strengths but they start developing the plumbing and the ability to use the oxidative system to recover rapidly but going back to again this larger periodization idea is when you start with a new stimulus it's uh your body is highly reactive but the resistance is low you cannot take much of it then that teeter totter goes the other way you'll no longer you have to figure out how to restore that reactivity and different training systems do it differently so an example of the American powerlifting system you basically go go lighter start over with a lightweight so you decondition yourself purposefully like two steps forward one step back MH and that's uh another example would be to use what um the Soviets called specialized variety and this is something that you could see in the Soviet weightlifting system with medv and Alex mvv one of the scientists and coaches and also the Westside barbell powerlifting Club so specialized variety as opposed to random variety it's when you have the same lift and with just very slight modifications so the motor program the intention stays the same but again imagine that instead of uh deadlifting deadlifting from the platform your deadlifting standing on a off a plate MH so it just slightly increased the range of motion but you're still doing the same thing or imagine that you uh bring your grip in the bench brass a couple of inches in or imagine that you use a block just as a popular exercise in powerlifting you put a like imagine putting a brick on your chest up to the size of a brick lowering it to that pausing and pressing back to work that very specific sticking point so you're still benching so what you're doing is you're resume you're resolving this conflict between accommodation and specificity and like you on one hand it's novel but on the other hand it's really it's like same but different it's a very good tactic it requires it requires uh the knowledge of knowledge of the iron game it's not some because if you go from the bench press to the military press or dips you might see Improvement but or might not because that's not specialized variety anymore but if you look at like in medv Alex medv when he coached the national team for the cleaning jerk and snatch for the two comp comp competitive lifts they had 100 variations wow but all these variations were like okay so now we're snatching from hang now we're snatching from blocks now we're jerking from the wck do you see what I mean they all this reminds me of uh this reminds me of this humorous book about Scandinavians written by Scandinavian explaining how very different different Scandinavians are and so this book has pictures of the same guy wearing different sweater sounds about right so yeah that's my Scandinavian relatives will chuckle at that I feel like one of the um again I'm not trying to point out the the ills of of uh the fitness culture but I feel like if I were to put up on a wall uh the two or three things that have caused the most confusion and and you know reduction in people's potential results from Fitness would be seeking the pump as its own thing and seeking soreness as its own thing and then confusing panting hard and sweating a lot with intensity yeah you know I feel like those three things you know people think I had a great workout or my new trainer is you know I finished just completely depleted you know this and then these are the same people that are complaining about an injury or they quit or they don't have the motivation because you know they they're not taking whatever pre-workout as required to generate that kind of quote unquote intensity um I'm not looking for agreement but would you agree or disagree I mean you know and then maybe by comparison we could sort of throw up on the wall the things that we should be seeking when we train as opposed to these kind of um you know before I answer this question since we're talking about the peripheral adaptations you made a great point about seeking pump I'm going to give you a great example how when not seeking pump is going to do so going to deliver great adaptation for you so do you remember that idea of punching the bag for an hour let's say or two hours that's how that promotes M countre endurance develop in the fast s fibers that can also be done with strength exercises as well for wrestlers and MMA fighters so you can do the bench press you can to bench press and develop endurance in your fast fed twitch fibers the nature of endurance is very very peculiar you know in uh team sports there's a term repeat Sprint ability so repeat Sprint ability means that let's say that you sprint for 20 MERS rest for less than a minute Sprint for another 20 you know just something like that so Sprint rest Sprint rest which is which reflects the nature of uh team sport football soccer and so on on the it's totally different from running 400 meters around the track in strength endurance is the same thing uh NFL combine you know that's it's it's a fine test whatever it's nice bodybuilding exercise good pump but on the field you're not doing 30 reps you're doing one rep and then it'll be later you're going to do another rep so uh your conditioning for a fast fibers can be structured in the same manner so there's Russian research researcher named bikin uh he put his uh several groups of athletes in different protocols so one of them was doing the typical high intensity whatever circuit training smoker right so you take 70% of your one rep max and you do this for 30 seconds and you go push hard and then you do next one and very typical then the other group anti-glycolytic group the athletes would live the same 70% % one rep max for three reps uh they do one exercise second exercise third exercise rest for one minute do it again and again and again so to The Listener 70 rep max an average athlete can probably crank out about 12 reps with it a fighter is probably going to crank out 20 some reps with that easily so they only do three reps and so three reps uh another exercise another exercise rest for one minute do it over and over and over and the end result was really fascinating the outcome there is one particular test discovered by the same researcher that like correlated has the highest correlation competitive performance for MMA fighters so this test was R 0.888 it's very very high and very interesting thing what it is it's the rate of heart rate recovery after an allout set was 70% one rep max deadlift it's hard set it's brutal very very brutal interestingly enough the Reps was 70% one rep max correlation was not so good even the deadlift strength was not so high but it's that recovery from that was was very very high so the group that did the Santa glycolytic work never did more than three reps completely blew the traditional training group out of the water then in addition to that they were able to bang out a lot more consecutive reps as well they weren't even in training for that then after that they also so competitive better results in competition and so on so forth it's uh it's a great way to train because you're able to so you take imagine taking a weight that's that you can lift maybe uh 12 to 20 times and you lift it about three times rest for a minute and do it again and again and again this is very much like a blue color workers um day and you're not seeking pump whatsoever but as a result you're going to develop that that type of endurance that repeats strength endurance that very much is applicable to most combat and team sports and also for the real life whenever you are moving uh Furniture you're not trying to look I'm going to try to get a pump let's see get this piano up there and I get another one then we're going to rest for 20 minutes then we're going to start over no uh Swedish work occupational strength they found that old and crafty and Wy workers like loggers and others they were able to like they they keep their efforts very brief and then they rest for a few seconds and do it over and over and over so that intermittent nature of rest is uh is very powerful seems like this is a repeating theme and by the way thank you for spelling that out so for people that perhaps want to try something like this and I intend to four exercises three um three exercises excuse me um done each at roughly 70% of your one repetition maximum so what you could do for about 12 repetitions but you're only doing three repetitions rest a minute in between exerc active again just walk around shake it off and do this for do this about 15 times possibly later 15 15 rounds up to 15 rounds um and so this could be uh zercher squat uh pullup um dip um deadlift or something like that maybe going not do the dead you know you use really good examples so this is this is a protocol that I did for for a couple friends of mine for their high level BJJ competition we did exactly that they did zerges they did pull-ups on towels and you know more more specific and more grip and they did the closed grip bench press and the reason it's close it doesn't put on K mod Mass but it you know works at triceps really quite nicely but yeah but you can even do it with one exercise three reps rest for a minute three reps rest for a minute uh and so on how many times per week is one repeating that uh you can repeat this three or four times a week easily but it depends on what else you do twice a week is enough even twice a week is enough and it fits your strength training regimen it doesn't take away from your strength day so it pretty much you can treat that as you light day for strengths for the same lifts okay so and this would uh is going to increase endurance but is also going to increase strength somewhat it's going to increase strength somewhat in B Bin's experiments definitely did at least on Fighters But realize Fighters typically are not that strong so up to a point up to a point it is going to increase your strength as well and it the very least is going to support your strength and it's uh it's a great way to just perfect your Technique perfect your skill it's wonderful it's very very meditative my colleague at strong first Brad Jones he even just uh uh wrote a book about it the iron cardio because uh he took a protocol strength aerobics protocol like this Russian protocol developed by another one of my colleagues alexar another one of our instructors and he just used the whole system and people loving it because uh sorry I'm going to go back from the beginning to alexar so he's um he lives in France and he was coaching some he was coaching some uh uh law enforcement some law enforcement personnel and they were on a stake out where they absolutely had no ability to train normally and they wanted to do something something effective so he said okay take this kettle bell and you keep it in your hotel room or wherever is your steak out do one clean one press one front squat put the kettle bell down Shake It Off one clean one press one squat put it down and like a metronome in a very rhythmical manner you're not trying to breathe hard you're not trying to get a pump with singles you won't and you do this for you do this for about you know 30 minutes or whatever amount time amount of time that you do and and it does develop that repeat strength endurance fantastically well there's additional secondary effect of some cardio because you're you're breathing in between pretty much your recovery your heart is recovering and um you're not getting sore because you talked earlier about like people seeking pump and seeking soreness one of the reasons soreness comes from is obviously you know a lot of eccentric contraction that's very true but what people don't realize that soreness also comes from too much acid in the past the coaches used to tell oh you know acid burns holes in your muscle it doesn't but what it does do is when the acid levels are high in the muscle it stimulates production of free radicals which Pound The Cellar membranes later it also stimulates activity of lome lomes and fites that just eat up eat up the tissue the muscle so if you do too much a if you do too much acidic work you're going to be sore as well so seeking that makes no sense whatsoever especially as we know not even from scientific studies but from athletic experience uh some people get sore all the time see no progress in anything some people don't get sore they keep getting stronger and everybody in between so there's no correlation if you're looking for pump on the other hand if you're trying to build muscle one very while building strength one very simple guideline would be I achieve some pump with a heavyweight and Low Reps so if you keep your reps five and at fewer even three but you achieve a little pump that means you've performed a sufficient volume of work to stimulate the adaptation what exactly happens in the B I cannot tell you but it absolutely does work for both uh strengths and both um both hypertrophy so many theories about what causes hypertrophy at least you and I know that we don't know we're just speculating here just a I really appreciate that you uh always acknowledge that um that we're sort of we're not totally in the dark about hypertrophy might might be I like this theory about the hydrogen um creating a permeability of the of the cells and you mentioned that then it gives the hormones access uh some folks might know and some people might know you know that the steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen and others they combine to cell surface receptors but they can also go into the nucleus of a cell itself and cause changes in expression which is sort of if you just think about puberty is the most Salient example right there's all these latent potential in the cells of the body but then once the testosterone and dihydro testosterone and estrogen arrives in the body depending on the on the the sex of the individual then you activate hair growth you activate breast growth you activate muscle growth thickening of the vocal anyway that's through Gene uh changes and gene expression um in this configuration that you described before you know uh of doing this um three repetitions and repeating you may be doing that three times a up to three you can even do one as you mentioned yes right three times a week could I also train for strength simultaneously same days or other days other days other days so on the intervening days I could go in and do my my real strength work yes and you look at your priority if uh if your strength is more important do this uh do this type of a strength aerobic work no more than twice a week MH and you know then you do strength like an additional three times or four times if uh that type of endurance is more important do real strength work once a week and then three four times of the other kind this is also a very good idea in general for planning for training planning for planning training different qualities because trying to develop everything to a high level at the same time it's impossible it simultaneously training in parallel everything only is good for young kids when they're developing because you know you got to try everything nothing's at a high level later on uh there were different models of how to structure addressing different qualities so one example would be training so here's one really good example how strength and hypertrophy can be uh can be addressed can be addressed at different periods the experiment goes back to 1970s it was done on Ivanov kova I forgot the third uh third author uh experimented done on throwers and they were doing squats and bench presses and uh one group was doing 85% for five triples you know typical heavy type stuff the other was three sets of 10 was 60% which is fairly typical hypertrophy work uh Jim Bros would say that's too light for sets of 10 and I say no it's not because you still have to throw the shot put the next day if you if you do 10 sets of 10 reps to failure you're going to be completely done your strength will be down by about 40% for for the next few days so and so they one group did this the other group did this they both made good gains uh and the third group but up to point then they they Plateau the third group they alternated two weeks of this two weeks of that and they in the quad interesting I have to say didn't make that much difference but in the bench press there's a huge difference that alternating these two types stimuli so that's an example of block training how you can do that but what you can also do is you could simply maintain a quality so fortunately it takes a lot less work to maintain anything that you reach than uh than to um to get there so typically training some quality once a week at a moderate effort is enough to maintain it like in strength example of strength if once a week you lift 80% of your max with three sets of three reps you can maintain your strength easily for months easily it just just doesn't take much at all and you don't want to stop your strength training ever totally because again it has that um it it will improve everything that you do even your endurance but then you can switch the priorities in the same matter and people can do that in their own way oh okay here's a great example so I love Stu's biblical week so where Stu McGill he trains two days a week of strength two days a week of Mobility two days a week of endurance which is uh which is a very good and balanced balanced model but what you could do for a while is you switch to doing one two three so let say one quality gets three days a week one quality gets two one quality gets one and then you shift the priority so this sort of a serial specializ ation is a very good tactics for for experienced traines maybe switching it up once every month perhaps once a month is good once a month is good and maintaining that um you know moderate hard what was it moderate very hard what was uh Franco's um what was the cycle forgive me for foret you know you can do that as well yeah what Franco had four weeks of deadlifts uh moderate heavy moderate very heavy and again we can Define them a lot of different ways but we definitely need to vary the effort not just the intensity somehow somehow in our training it can be done differently in different uh in different Training Systems one very simple way is just to stop stop your sets earlier before long before failure and you know later on and some weeks just get a little bit closer to that so that's an example of that classic American cycling powerlifting cycling so when on your week four you're going to do five reps with your five rep max but on week one you're doing five reps with your perhaps 10 rep max so that's that's a very simple way of doing that where you go easy and then you go harder and then you start over but there are many many different other ways of of structuring it but generally speaking I'd like to warn people that training hard has to be done but it's not something it has to be done really small doses it's like let's use singles as an example heavy singles heavy singles are the special sauce of strength training it they cannot be used as the foundation of your training unless you are except for some very few genetically gifted individuals you know we all know that bulgarians have done that in the weightlifting but again these guys were specially selected specially assisted and they were broken very quickly uh Soviet Champions stayed there from Soviets who uh won the Olympics at the age of 36 like BL Felder and alexv for weightlifting that's just a absolutely old man and rigard said David rigard said I think what 63 World Records because they were very careful about when to use this uh near maximal stimuli they figured out this and the system itself the Soviet weightlifting system was totally empirical which is really fascinating they just looked what works what doesn't compare it and just kep kep trying so they've experimented with everything and they simply have found that uh certain observations like okay lighter lifters can do more heavy singles than heavier guys intermediates can do more than the advanced guys uh it's going to vary from lift to lift a lifter to lifter no difference between guys who onun drugs and guys who are not but you have to individualize it and they found that if you do too many heavy singles you're going to not progress rapidly you hurt yourself you don't do enough you don't progress as quickly so it has to be have to find that sweet spot for yourself and they also were very definite that the singles are maximum so that's what competitions are for so they would go to 90 maybe 92 and a half% once a blue moon 95 but you're not there to test yourself there's even like uh like Russian powerlifters what they do couple weeks before a meet they have this uh work up to a weight that's kind of Max so the word for it this prka and prute it translates kind of like estimate it's like an estimate this is not you're guessing like you see this is where I'm at that gives me an idea what's going to be my first attempt what my opener is going to be instead of oh I'm going to test myself I'm going to show them gym is not the place to show anything that's what the platform's for so you need to find uh if you're interested and serious about strengths you need to find how often you can go heavy in the different lifts start with you know start with something maybe once a month about 90% And then try to see you doing it more doing it or doing it uh fewer times but the meat and potatoes of the training has to begin this moderately heavy weights heavy enough heavy enough to respect not light enough not to fear and most of the work has to be done with that so it's like those sets of three four maybe five reps with 80 80% something something like that and that's fairly Universal across the training systems because the American powerlifting system uh you know is organized the cycling organized totally different but that's again there's going to be you no fives and threes and fours that's going to be a big deal Soviet system different but a lot of Threes a lot of fours some fives some variations but why it is so some of it possibly has to do with skill practice because this goes to an example it's a western study of uh a discrete skill a discrete skill to listeners that means something that happens once kind of like a throw or a lift as opposed to continuous skill like running and in an experiment they tested these athletes do this discreete skill for six sets of one three sets of two or one set of six and uh two sets of three did much better so supposedly it's like there's certain amount of repetitiveness like when you hit the perfect trap and then you're die MH so again three triples have that very special quality and presumably there's a drop off of ability to concentrate and really execute properly absolutely I mean uh one thing that keeps coming through here is that whether or not one's talking about high volume or low volume or endurance or strength quality Quality quality oh no doubt about it every everything else is potentially detrimental and frankly has added a lot of confusion to the fitness literature where people I think you know they're doing you know five sets of five or do I do 10 sets of 10 and it I if I may you know this isn't my my field of expertise but again having been in and around it for a while I feel like the message that keeps coming through that's going to deliver the results is every single repetition high quality the rest period high quality whatever that may be walking around shaking it off the the structuring of the program high quality I think people are far too halfhazard and seeking the pump and soreness and some sweat so that they can have their post-workout shake well I'm not trying to be and a selfie and a selfie uh between every set um and just kind of check the box even for people that aren't competitive athletes I think there's just such a an enormous range of things to be gleaned from taking one's Fitness training seriously um even the word Fitness is kind of a strange word training seriously right I've never even called it a workout I think I picked that up from Menor you train you don't like I've never or you practice or you practice I like that very much I also like the distinction between students and and clients that's that's a very these are not just these are not just labels I think they really no they really not change our cognitive frame in the Soviet system uh when you're talking about your training session often times it was referred to as a lesson when various qualities were developed like strength endurance and so on vashi for example often mentioned that like education of qualities and at strong first are we talk about a practice not a workout and uh great line that was written 100 Years Ago by Earl litterman and his uh secrets of strength and back then uh strength athletes understood the importance of not training on the nerve so they understood you you just train and then eventually you're going to go for a PR but the rest of the time you don't kill yourself and when he's describing kind of this uh early adherent of this high intensity whatever ever and he's referring to him he says he has literally worked himself out and he says that's something that Strength Seeker cannot afford so semantically when you're trying to work yourself out that's you're trying to exhaust yourself or are you trying to practice to excel to get better at something and that applies to inequality because endurance very much has a has a skill component just like strength because the ability to uh reuse the elastic properties of the tissue issues the ability to relax between the contractions to restore the circulation the ability to maintain the proper posture and so on and so forth these are all skills the breathing breathing skill huge extremely important for strength for endurance for absolutely anything and if you're going through this mindlessly it's uh yes yeah nobody's going to get very far this way okay so while one could use resistance training in order to generate strength and endurance you explained how to do that there are good number number of people out there including myself that sometimes like to get outside for a run or to hike um as you mentioned earlier about the rucksack I'm not such a fan of the ruck sack because of being pitched forward but I like this idea of carrying the kettle bell and switching sides now nowadays they also have some weight vests that are a little bit more um uh you know close to the body that distribute the weight um what are your thoughts about going into the gym in order to do the strength training and then generating the endurance work elsewhere to be blunt like how would one combine lifting and running in a way that allows one to get stronger and develop endurance perhaps simultaneously if we're talking about right now uh people who are just active people who are not athletes there are several things they need to keep in mind one is uh the timing relative timing of strength work and endurance work if the strength exercises that you're doing are primarily neural adaptations is which you're targeting which means lower repetitions heavier stuff then it's important to be fresh when you're doing the exercise it's not really doesn't matter as much what happens afterwards so which means that you could do some heavy deadlifts you know heavy deadlifts uh and then a few hours later you can go for your hike on the other hand if your uh lifting is more hypertrophy oriented it's less important if you come in tired it's okay even if you just hiked in the morning and then you went uh did your curls but afterwards for 36 48 hours it's ideally to restrict endurance exercise so because you're really going to have a massive conflict right there and uh it's it's not a good idea to do that if you're doing our preferred work of let's say sets of five reps five reps again they address both endurance and strength well I guess you better keep a window on both hands right there there's always a conflict you know Thomas saell said there are no Solutions they're only uh they're only uh compromises so you just have to decide which way you want to compromise but that separation in time really does help the other thing is spending different times when you focus on one thing versus the other so the next two months you're going to spend on hitting your strength hard and you're just going to do two hikes a week just to just for your health just to maintain and then summer rolls around and you put your lifting on the on the back burner you left lift less not necessarily lighter just less and you spend a lot more time outdoors and uh and do these different things keeping in mind also the duration of uh the duration of training so the longer your training session is of any kind the more you are triggering adaptations that are uh that are more in favor of endurance so your cortisol level goes up and there are some other things that do happen that drive you towards endurance as opposed to strength so even in your your strength training don't make the sessions too long what's too long it's really hard to know at this point in the Soviet weightlifting practice the top guys would spend two two and a half hours they would for them that work that seemed appropriate but then again don't forget that that point they're juicing and in the pr steroid eras those times are shorter and this is one of the difference in steroids by the way that's in your training when use steroids or not the uh as I mentioned earlier Soviets esta the correlation with the volume of lifting and uh muscle mass that's one thing but there also established correlation between volume of lifting at 80% or higher and strength and the correlation is very strong 0.84 however uh if you're talking about the muscle mass with that lighter stuff some lifters would just get great results and some lifters would just get more endurance and they found that guys were juicing they can keep doing higher volumes and still still keep getting more muscular but uh the guys who are not who are clean they're just not able to do that so trial and air probably like Marty gagher says fill an hour I think that's a safe I think that's a safe guideline fill an hour yeah I like the fill an hour I don't think I've ever spent more than an hour of actual work in the gym maybe a 75 minutes or so I notice if I train longer than that I pay a serious price in terms of post exercise fatigue later in the day I'd actually like to talk about this concept um I looked it up before sitting down today there's a little bit of literature starting to emerge not not as much as I would like about post exercise coleric depletion you know so much of our ability to hold our attention is dependent on epinephrine nor epinephrine and acetylcholine release in the brain and of course muscle muscular contractions acetool being the dominant transmitter from nerve to muscle um communication but this idea that if we exercise too intensely or even if we just do cognitive work that's very intense for a period of time that there's this post exercise col energic depletion and then we get this what people typically call brain fog although that's not a real medical term so I think from the Practical standpoint a lot of people who would like to train more for strength train more often for strength do strength and endurance work the the challenge sometimes isn't just scheduling it it's that we feel depleted and tired afterward have you observed this and is there a way to use strength training or other forms of training to improve cognitive function because I you know again as you pointed out only compromises not Solutions but I do see a world in which one could use their physical training to give them a uh for lack of a better word a boost into the day so you're getting stronger you're developing your your health and you're also able to then lean into your day with with more more focus and attention that would be the ultimate scenario yeah well there's obviously we're looking at a zero some game so there's you only have so much you know your resources are limited one thing that will absolutely help is fragmentation it's been proven that dividing up a given workload into smaller chunks allows you doesn't matter what it is whether it's endurance training or strength training or some cognitive work you're able to you're able to do more and that's one thing that to consider the other is uh obviously the um feedback you know you have to listen to your body pretty much Soviets stressed very much that you have to take the cybernetic approach you have to have the feedback no matter what the training plan says says you have to listen to you have to listen to that feedback and freshness in the Soviet system of strength training and not just in weightlifting freshness was Paramount it's even better let's talk about how track athletes in the Soviet Union and trained for strengths and that's more that's would be even more applicable to a lot of the listeners because they definitely didn't spend two and a half hours in the you know in the gym so Professor vladimirov he was a head coach and he was one of the first to implement heavy lifting for the for the track after right after the Soviets decide hey look at these Americans you know lifting heavy Weist Bruce Randall and Paul Anderson and Canadian Doug heurn so these lifters he has absolutely says always do Low Reps so they would never do more than three four reps even with the lightest weight even with a warm-up weight they spent a lot of time doing just singles and doubles and it was absolutely essential that they stayed fresh and part of it was just the how they felt part of it is the performance how well they jumped and so on and how they felt after so they found if you're really obsessive about it you have that tonic effect that lasts at least until the next day and the tonic effect is both for your strength for your power but uh also for you know your cognitive functions as well but it's also very very interesting that here's an idea uh do a bench press before the next day before you're competing in a jump or do a heavy Squad the day before you're competing as a thrower so it's again it's very interesting how the opposite part of the body stimulating that was uh was very very helpful very interesting phenomena so they found if the strength work is is familiar and non-exhaustive it absolutely facilitates whatever is that you do afterwards and um restricting the this is where the difference this is where track athletes were very different from a lot of other people they try to restrict their volume as much as possible of strength training in part because well they had to do other things and because they had to stay fresh so uh if you look at the volume if you look at generally speaking how many repetition that you want to perform per exercise per uh per training session and again these are purely empirical numbers they come from Soviet weightlifting but they were also applied in track so the minimal volume is 10 to 20 repetitions total so minimum and uh optimal is 20 to 30 maximal it becomes 30 to 50 in that window so when you're looking at 20 to 30 reps maybe on the lower and right there you're going to build strength and if you also are going to not go to failure and rest sufficiently between sets unless greas unless you're greasing the groove you need to look at at least five minutes pretty much and that's both for neural and B chemical reasons but more is really better unfortunately really a lot of it is just comes down to listening to your body and just using your judgment I wish I had any better I wish I had any better answer here I think it's a terrific answer I like to leave the gym with some gas in the tank H because well I get paid to think and to speak as it were uh not to lift but and many great thinkers in the strength World starting from leaderman back a 100 years ago to uh to Soviet weightlifting uh authorities like you know ronov and uh Roman and uh later on somebody like even Steve Justa was a very colorful individual just brilliant brilliant uh strength strength athlete um a farmer from Nebraska who just came up with some fantastic protocols but he would say that you've got to finish stronger than when you started I love that and that seam is very much permeates uh professional or high level strength training where this mentality of a workout or try to get smoked or pumped or throw up in the bucket they they would look at you as that's insane one of the reasons that also Soviets restricted the number of reps in the squad because you do sets of 10 in the squad you're going to definitely put on some mths no question about it but one of the reasons they restricted that very few people did sets of 10 except for heavy weights who were had a hard time bulking and even more is like okay that's too much cardiorespiratory stress and even though Soviet weightlifters did some general physical training like cross country running or playing soccer but they're not trying to get their cardio in the uh on the lifting platform that was just made no sense whatsoever so restricting the Reps will go a very long way restrict uh increasing the rest periods to at least 5 minutes would go a very long way and restrict a number of exercises because people don't realize that you're using different muscle groups but still using the same brain you're still same using the same adrenals and uh all that stuff really adds up and so I would say two during one practice one training practice maybe two maybe three exercises Max lifts and nothing wrong with doing just one and yeah if you want to you know do your curls and whatever calves later that's fine but you can tack it on in the end or you can do it totally separate those things don't really zap you you can just come in in a separate day and just do your enjoy your calf burn love it there seems to be an over Reliance nowadays on pre-workout stimulants uh I'm a big consumer of caffeine in the form of yerba mate and coffee I'm old school that way um not that I my coffee yeah you you still drink coffee every day yes I do yeah but only twice got a moderation moderation right um these days there's a lot of emphasis on just trying to get as you know absolutely wired and and geared up for training um and I think that in part contributes to why people feel this post exercise fatigue you know they go hit the gym hard after a pre-workout and then they're doing their post-workout shake and a bunch of carbohydrates to replenish their glycogen and then of course two hours later you want to take a nap I mean it's amazing anyone could study or do anything at that point I think that's uh very different than the kind of training you're describing I also um just so I'd love your thoughts on on stimulants generally and how they can support or hinder performance and I'm also curious about um just the what's lost in that model in terms of learning how to cycle one's energy up and down you know several times today you've mentioned this this thing of of the ability to relax the muscles and relax the the nervous system in between sets um maybe even in between reps who knows um but usually between sets and certainly and sometimes between reps under certain circumstances abely yeah so so maybe we talk about stimulants uh before we started today we were talking about you know when stimulants can actually hinder performance um when they can help and then maybe we talk about this cycling of of um tension and relaxation because I look at training physically as a as a as a venue for exploring nervous system function and control over nervous system generally that one can apply elsewhere so that's the kind of theme I'll just roll roll out onto the T well first of all I'll preface it by saying that stimulant and any kind of Pharmacy stely out of my wheelhouse so what you're about what I'm about to say is purely reflected knowledge you know with your neurobiology background you can tell the listeners so much more than I could possibly can but top athletes when they compete after a competition I'm talking about power strength sports like powerlifting or weightlifting for the next two weeks they're they're just gone they're completely flat because there are two adaptations that take place in uh in in strength training proper strength training so on one hand it's much more economical uh function of the adrenal glands on the other hand it's much higher capacity as well so these are the guys in gals who are able to Crank It Up really really high when they want to but they're also able to really keep it keep it down when they don't have to and they do know that for the next two weeks after after the competition or after some idiotic gym Max you know that might take a week they are they're going to be flat they're going to be completely gone so you really have to spare your adrenaline the lifters who take heavy lifts in in the gym they still typically they stay at the training Max not the competition Max so what's the training Max a training Max it's uh the heaviest way that you can possibly lift with without uh getting too excited about it and uh back in the 50s uh uh luchkin he was uh one of the fathers of Soviet weightlifting he came up with a great uh tactic how to find that weight if your heart rate goes up before the set that's too heavy so that you got to like you got to monitor yourself unless you're in competition of course that's that's a different game if I will defer to others about how much uh one should or could take stimulants before training uh lifting I'm talking about but generally speaking you got to do it moderation and especially you got to save it for the times when you really need it like in the American powerlifting system when you have during week three and four that's good time to do it during the weeks one and two when the weights are lighter lets your adrenals recover and you don't need to push yourself as hard anyway so it's just one example how to how to go about this if you have to drink some stupid energy drink to just get yourself up to training there's something wrong in your life possibly it is something that's lifestyle choices and you need to address it if you always feel exhausted after training you're missing out on life I mean if you're doing a very a desk job that does not require High cognitive ability something that's really mechanical with pen and paper or computer and you choose to just destroy yourself on a daily basis with uh a lot of sess to failure or metcons or whatever it is well it's your choice if you want to destroy your life like that but again if you look at your adrenal profile if you look at uh your sympathetic dominance if you look at your how you're just feeling is going to be really really awful the other angle to this is um as we talked earlier in learning and skill training skill practice is learning current performance is not indicative of learning so just because you're able to lift five founds more because you got yourself all jacked up and some drink doesn't mean you necessarily got stronger so you just need to come in and put in your practice and walk away and come back and then when there's time and it's the day to go heavier that's that's when you do that so don't want to discourage you from drinking coffee in fact if you drink a stimulate coffee should be the only thing the rest of this stuff is I don't know yeah coffee tea coffee tea and uh then uh figure out again figure out what is that moderate moderate amount figure out how to use it when you truly need it as opposed to be relying on it all the time uh would you mind before we go to the next question if I if I just share with you a result that I just wanted to plant in your brain uh because I've been excited to tell you about this because it's new results from the field of Neuroscience that I don't think anyone's discussed anywhere but I think you might find interesting for your sake of discussion here but also for looking forward um I didn't do this study I wish I had the the study very briefly is interested in the neural basis of choking not choking someone out or not anything else related to choking but when one feels that the stakes are really high and suddenly ability Falls away what is that so what they did is they developed this game where essentially the potential payoff in this game while recording from neurons in the brain is either low medium or very high or the occasional jackpot like you could just win the whole thing and the payoff is is very very considerable then they looked at the amount of upper motor neuron recruitment so essentially the areas of the brain that drive coordinated muscular Behavior or action and what they found is that it basically scales with the level of reward so you get more um neuronal engagement as the reward scales up however every time the jackpot was offered it over engages too many motor neurons and so that this notion of Cho of like choking when the stakes are really have IR radiation that you cannot control exactly it's like spill over of like it's like too much we could call it too much excitement but it's not adrenaline in this case although that's probably associated with it you think oh great you know I'm going to I'm going to get an award I'm going to get bigger or even bigger okay oh my goodness this could change everything and all of a sudden performance just tanks and so it turns out it's it's a bra it's a brain thing at the level of over recruitment which just speaks to this idea of being able to maintain arousal within a certain range is an essential skill to any performer I just i' share that it's a fun set of results all I learn something I have to share it with somebody who I think might might U care so if ever people wonder about the uh why people choke it's it it is a hyperarousal at the level of the brain not apparently not so much the body well being able to control arousal it's such a key skill for an athlete and uh part of that obviously it should be directed as sports psychologist and there are some fantastic techniques for example Dr Jud boto who is an author who published the book with strong first uh Dr J squatted 602 at by a weight of 132 and that was back in the 80s he was in his 40s after serious back injury surgery and uh he was he was a sport psychologist and he discusses this various various skills as fascinating his control of exitation inhibition was such that he would sleep between attempts a couple minutes before the attempt his Handler or coach would wake him up he would wake up he'd get himself into frenzy he'd lift the weight to go back to sleep nine times a day throughout the day now that's a Mastery of excitation inhibition your on switch and off switch so part of that are is sports psychology there are tools in sport psychology for that part of it is uh training is whatever you do in the gym some of your habits and some of your practices like for example okay David riger is one of the greatest weightlifters of all time some people would say the greatest weightlift of all times and U when he was discovered by rud plukfelder his coach who was another Olympic champion world champion one of the things that the coach was impressed with is that rigert would do his set and then that after he set he would just go completely limp like a rag and he was very impressed with that later um in riger's career when he was a world champion already in the United States so there's a there's an America coach r writes how he saw him in Columbus Ohio or Cleveland Ohio competing back in the 70s he was uh lying and smoking a cigarette and uh then he gets up he snatches 60 kilos like 135 pounds or something once then he just picks up something else equally trivial and then he goes and does a goes his first attempts and then ends up with a superior performance at a different time riger bet box of kanyak to that he would snatch 90% of his max which which was his max was probably around 370 or something so he was able to snatch 90% of that no warmup whatsoever and so this is this ability of that incredible control so part of it is whatever you're born with part of it is Sport psychology techniques but part of is developing some habits as soon as you're done with your lift just power down incidentally after training a strength athlete ought to perform a cool down and uh Russians did some uh did some numbers on powerlifters and they found that the top powerlifters they spend time and cool down and the guys are not so good they don't because not only it just allows you to bring your exitation down get your parasympathetic get you to start recovering so you do some easy stretching you do some meditating you do some breathing exercises whatever you do but even after each set so you so you put up that heavy deadlifter Squat and you just immediately come down and then you walk around and you chill so you just try to tune your uh switch so much breathing exercises come in handy for that there are breathing exercises to increase your excitation uh there are breathing exercises that are able to very much uh put you in a state of inhibition very deep inhibition even some of them are hypercapnic some of hypoxic which means you know you try to increase carbon dioxide or you're trying to decrease oxygen there are some very sophisticated yet really quite simple techniques that that uh that can help that can help you do that I love this concept of just learning to push on the accelerator um push on the break and to and to play with disinhibition as a first person to come on this podcast even among the neuroscientists I've spoken with to talk about disinhibition thank you for bringing that well the history of that's a beautiful concept and an important one for how we function that's a that absolutely is the original research was done in the 60s eai and steinhouse uh 1961 I believe and then later on that was a big part of the training method of Dr Fred Hatfield Fred Hatfield is a legend in the uh in the iron game he was uh one of the first to Squad a th000 pounds in competition and he was uh he was just a fantastic lifter and a and just brilliant scientist so he tried to direct a lot of the training uh towards this inhibition so he even developed special techniques that are largely forgotten ironically but yes disinhibition is huge and it's uh also one of the one of the things about disinhibition to it's also very important to avoid failing because never failing a lift that's part of dis inhibition so like we talked about Ed con early another one of the powerlifting grades ad cone competed over several decades set over 70 World Records in several weight classes uh only missed a couple lifts in competition never missed a training lift whatsoever always calm always composed an amazing lifter amazing guy and what's very likely happened is that his inhibitory Pathways just shriveled and got pruned and died what people don't realize that you know greasing the groove that's the term proper term long-term potentiation is like when you are getting better at like that transmission gets stronger it's like your nerves become superconductors but there's also its evil twin long-term depression so pretty much what happens is now you're trying as hard but your muscles are not jumping in response anymore so one of the ways to uh get this long-term depression is by by failing so whenever you're attempting certain thing and if it doesn't happen that that's a way that pathway starts starts firing weaker and the inhibitory Pathways start become stronger and it becomes even worse if you're emotional about it so you said quite a few things about adrenaline but uh adrenaline has adrenaline does promote neuroplasticity but not always in a good way so if you look at the PTSD treatments you will find that if uh a person re-experiences that bad whatever thing that happened and then it gets into the feedback loop that positive feedback positive doesn't mean good positive it just means it keeps increasing it because every time that there's a spike of ADR adrenaline that reinforces the memory so if you missed the attempt and you also got really upset about it and you remember remember it again so you're making yourself weaker and weaker which reminds me of a very fascinating way that the Ancients used for uh to record some events before before there's writing so let's say there's a wedding between VIP families they bring a kid young kid seven-year-old let's say and make the kid watch the whole thing and after after the festivities they throw the kid into the river the kid crawls out of the ri and it was he doesn't know to he doesn't expect it and the kid climbs out of the river he's going to remember that wedding for the rest of his life he's going to hold that record because of the adrenaline Spike asso so that really did increase the neuroplasticity so that memory became really deeply ingrained so yeah part of uh part of disinhibition is not promoting inhibition is just not failing so Fred Hatfield had a beautiful line uh success beg gets success failure begins failure train to success not to failure do you recommend actually avoiding train to muscular failure absolutely there is really no reason for that if you're doing that with uh single joint bodybuilding exercises like curls it probably does not make doesn't matter and if you're doing it for bodybuilding but I still don't see the point because every rep closer to failure that it's going to increase exponentially your recovery time so you're not going to get quite as much uh yeah you might get more muscle gain from that particular last trap but your recovery is going to be increased so much and also as you start training to failure you also you're converting more of your fibers to toward slower toward slower types so on the other hand if you don't train to failure you don't so there's an interesting Spanish study when uh they found that when athletes train to failure again they're some of the mein and type 2x fast fibers they convert it to 2A so they they became slower probably because now it's an endurance event when you're training for as many reps as possible it's really an endurance event on the other hand the athletes that trained with half the maximum possible repetitions uh they did not experience that decline which goes back several decades to when Arad vario vario Olympic champion scientist head coach incredible incredible person uh he said there is a big difference between six sets of three and three set a six because uh and you think like this sounds like the most obvious thing to say but the fact is you build just as much strength with six sets of three as three sets of six you get a lot less tired you get to practice for three extra sets and you can train sooner so that's uh that's fundamental so pushing to failure also the other thing is about the control of your Technique towards the last TRS there's no control left but imagine that you always have that perfect technique so you grease that pathway that becomes a reflex in fact early on the Soviet Sports scientist very much view strength adaptation as just the development of conditional reflex kind of like you know Pavo with the dogs drooling dogs and then you go into the competition and you psych yourself up and you don't even know what's going on you're not aware but you only have one pathway there's no plan B you only remember how to do your deadlift in this particular know any other way the neurons are trained to to complete the execution of the movement exactly and all in a very specific way because there's no plan B when you start failures so you start okay this is the stressful situation so I re I revert to plan B but for there's Plan B for amateurs top athletes don't have plan B watch a top lifter fail an attempt he or she is going to shake with that bar shake shake shake shake and finally it's going to come down but it's not like the butt's going to shoot up or something ugly is going to happen so going back to that point you made earlier about the quality of practice quality is absolutely Paramount and it's uh strength training is a skill practice any athletic training is a skill practice maybe writing the elliptical is not a skill practice but it's not a it's just not a sport anyway it's not anything any you know even hiking is a practice you're trying to stay tall you're trying to breathe in a particular manner all practice the Crossovers between physical training and um mental Pursuits are astonishing to me you know as we're talking about this avoiding going to failure um I'm in the process of writing my first book I know you've written several books and I'm finding it to be very different than anything else I've ever done and the experienced writers tell me that you should you know end on a uh uh end on a sentence where you kind of know what the next sentence could be perhaps to see the unconscious mind for the next day but but that you don't want to run right up into a wall and then bang your head against that wall uh metaphorically speaking um because it places a kind of frustration into your nervous system that you arrive to the page with the next day I guess the opposite could be argue too but but it fits very well with um with what we're talking about here I because of the early Mike mener training uh or the influence I should say um I've tended to train a failure uh purposefully and used to do Force reps and drop sets and all that stuff as the years have gone by I've started only incorporating a few sets to failure and my volume has increased somewhat and I'm training heavier at lower repetitions and my progress as I get you know toward my fifth decade just continues to um just continues and so I I just decided as you were saying uh the last couple of sentences that for the rest of the year um I'm going to not train to failure because I really want to experience what it's like to do that for a long period of time as opposed to just reducing the number of sets that I take to failure I'm also I'm very stringent about form and always have been and I do want to ask what are your thoughts on um unless somebody's training for isometric or Ecentric specific training full range of motion not just for sake of building strength but can using a full range of motion also improve flexibility without some dedicated flexibility training and I'd like to use this as a segue to talk about flexibility training yes it can so sarum murus can grow in length as well so the contractile part of the muscle they can grow lengthwise as well it's uh something that needs to be done carefully and cautiously of course and it's uh with not with heavy weights eventually it's possible for a person to perform you know flexibility feeds with heavier weights if it's desirable but initially something go lighter so yes absolutely you can and uh it's it's one of the easiest way to promote flexibility and uh flexibility also has a very much a a neural component as well so part of it obviously you know you're looking at you're looking at what's happening in the joints of course part you're looking at uh you know the length the length of the the length of the tissues too but a lot of it is also the ability to reset the regulation of MUSC muscle lengths and tension so it's uh like the ability to do a split for example it's part of it is yeah well if you're provided your hip joints are built for that sort of thing a lot of it is really in your mind because you're experiencing defensive inhibition you're just afraid you're going to get a torn turn in half so which brings us to very interesting parallel as we kept talking about um Quality and has also talked about that flow Channel by Professor chah exactly thank you so between uh boredom and anxiety so when you're trying to do a split for example so you see somebody trying to get into that stretch and that person goes oh sitting there and panicking and being in total pain and nothing good is going to happen you're pretty much just uh facilitating this pain Pathways and you're just learning to hate this exercise a smarter individual would get to the point to the edge of pain and then stay there for a while and owning it until this the uh until the spindle is reset you know okay accept the new range of motion add some contraction relaxation contraction relaxation you know isometric stretching you know progress progress even further so in any type of training forcing the adaptation is just not going to work whether it's flexibility whether it's strength whether it's endurance there's time for very high level of effort but there's never time for ripping yourself in half right there's never time for hurting yourself on purpose so uh but yes do do uh long range of motion work to increase range of motion for the upper body I'm obviously very partial to his kettle bells but one of the great many benefits of kettle bell training you know a bow they handle is uh the way it's designed so you press it from here overhead that offset Center gravity helps to pull your arm back so you're just improving the shoulder flexion you're improving thoracic extension it's so much easier to place yourself in exactly good position and then just stay there so it's very important to stay open to keep that keep that useful posture and keep that good uh good shoulder function so but yeah with squats you can definitely do that just very progressively one warning about squats if you're going for parallel squat like it is in powerlifting it's a parallel defined as the top of the knee is a little higher than the crease on the hip not a right people will argue about this um in some comical ways from time to time so when a parallel is not right angle at the knee correct it's parallel the top of the the top of the thigh I I realize you said it very clearly but I'm just making sure because debates abound on the internet the top of the thigh should be parallel to the floor well or deeper yeah yeah but but when you do go for that depth or somewhere in that ballpark uh that's uh you can go wide in The Stance you can progressively increase the width of distance if you do it for flexibility there have been people who are doing squats like in know almost like a horse stance style squats and progressively developing great level of flexibility it's possible to do that but uh you are doing that you're going wider but not necessarily deeper so it's okay to go wider but you still you're still your femur should not be dipping too much so if you're trying to go Rock Bottom in the white stance your hip architecture is not designed for that right so like Tom Platz like famous for squatting very very deep like he was narrow but he used a narrow stance got it so glutes on Cals practically but he was a shorter guy right but he also he was but also he was also squatting in a pretty narrow stance so in this particular case you're not experiencing with the hip you know with the hip limitation right there so it's okay for you but imagine if you try to go wider and then you try to go it's just again this is not not a good idea you could end up on the floor literally on the floor if you want to develop here's a great way to develop flexibility for this type of rock bottom squat if you're not there yet uh initially even without resistance assume your normal squat stands and I'm talking about a narrower stands you know shoulder wi or somewhere there and approach the wall face the wall put your arms out and start squatting and you will find the wall is going to teach you so it is the feedback from the wall if you start doing something funny with your spine you're going to hit your head on the wall and fall back so it's it provides terrific feedback it is something that I learned originally from uh uh from shakun a shikun practitioner and again quite a number of skills that my system are picked up from from martial arts but we applied the strong first to use that for teaching people that upright Squat and developing the developing the mobility for deep squat it's a it's a foolproof it's like uh Greg Cook would call this a self-correcting exercise and those are really the best when the coach can walk away and you know have a cigarette and the student is still going to be able to do it righty I love your book relax into stretch I think it's a really important concept this idea that the nervous system and our mental state is preventing inhibiting a good amount of our natural flexibility that we can work with the mental state and Progressive relaxation and contraction of muscles and related tissues to well absolutely can and it's very much minded over the matter I have a great success story so one of uh one of my senior instructors as strong first Steve fredes so met him a couple decades ago and uh he had a severe back injury so he spent eight or n months in bed and perette and he's not he was not athletic he done some jogging or things like that in the past and uh he decided to get serious about getting strong so he healed up until he was healthy he started uh lifting kettle bells then after that he started powerlifting and he started doing uh proper stretching like this so he's uh right now he's Steve in his late 60s he holds a a bunch of American Masters records in the deadlift even though his back was totally messed up lifts without a belt he's you can break your fist on his abs I like having people punch would you please punch Steve just don't hurt yourself but he also worked out have to suspend his SI splits and you know that's at that point he was uh probably in his 50s when he did that and maybe 60s possibly and then he even competed in these crazy allaround meets where there's one lift where you hang between two chairs then you pick up a dumbbell from the ground you can find the footage somewhere in the internet so here's a man who took uh who did not take his injury line down so once he was cleared to train he decided to approach his training with the uh attitude of a musician because he's a music professor and in my experience that people who who become very successful and uh in strength musicians and martial artists are among the people who who can succeed because they're used to practice for many hours they're used to paying attention to small detail and they're used to doing whatever other people consider boring over and over so again here is this 67-year-old man with abs you can break your hands on deadlift records and uh and full splits that's that's what a human mind is capable of love this concept of a practice or of practice not of a practice but instead of training I always thought a training is such a better word than working out and it probably is but I think practice uh is such a better verb than training is also good of course but practice is uh it puts you in the mind in the right frame frame of mind you imagine the word work out like litterman quote he literally worked himself out uh as long as you're highlighting um remarkable instances of people in the second half of their life let's let's say um getting quite strong developing impressive skills before we started recording today you were relaying to us uh that your your father has um acquired some significant strength could you just share some of his um his abilities to inspire both the uh the people um in the second half of their life or so and to um motivate slash intimidate the younger ones and um get them going because they really have no excuse I'm very proud of my parents and uh they're both 87 years old and uh my father has always been an athlete and then at the age of 71 I brought him to powerlifting meat and I see him in the warm-up area picking up you know 225 pounds with bad form like Dad what are you doing he got interested so fast forward a few years and uh by the time he was 75 he had several American records in uh several weight classes and uh he deadlifted uh in the low 400s uh without a belt body weight of 198 and in fact when um uh back at that point when Professor Stuart McGill who is a very good friend of mine he uh came to watch my dad uh I think he pulled like 385 for triple before competition in at Gold Gym Venice and uh Ste examined his back back and he said he had a you know muscularity in the back of a 40y old so I thought it was pretty pretty pretty cool so uh he's not deadlifting right now because an old injury cut up to him he fell off a track vehicle you know like imagine a tank without a gun uh military tractor vehicle on Ice in the winter and uh about 40 years ago and there are some things that cut up to him so he cannot deadlift right now but he's still twice a week he does over 50 pull-ups in total and you know and at least twice a week he does over 100 perfect body weight squats like powerlifting style squats you know and he does that he does push-ups and things like that so he just stays on top of that and he's still maintaining very good strength very good muscularity so the approach to building muscle for him is it's that same volume with medium reps and the medium effort it always works because it builds strength it builds muscle it's very safe it's uh it's very enjoyable and uh my mother she uh she used to be a professional Bina and she got started training since she was six so she because she had to train all day she hates exercise but she still does it because she must and uh she came up with a great anti-glycolytic training protocol for herself so this is something she invented I had nothing to do with it but it's just totally goes with vash's work she climbs stairs at a highrise and she will climb stairs from one floor to the next she'll walk the hallway come back and then go to the next floor so that's the same idea that vasansi had intensify the intensity of contraction and then give a little time to not so in order to for the acid not to pile up so you keep that effort creating phosphate powered and aerobic powered and you know so she does that for 17 floors or whatever a few times a week and plus other things but yeah I'm very fortunate uh very proud of my parents my father-in-law Roger he's a great example and a great greas the group success story so he is a retired firefighter and Marine and uh at the age of 64 and he always uh lifted very unusual for his generation he started when he was 15 and uh never stopped but he couldn't quite do 20 pull-ups when he was a marine so at the age of 64 he got on the Greaser Groove protocol so so at that point his max was 10 reps so I said Roger every time you go by the pullup bar hit hit five and when they become really really easy and then you can add a rep well a few months later he finally he when he worked up to nine daily reps he tested he could do 20 Pull-Ups so at 64 he finally aced the US Marine Corps pull-up PT test something that he couldn't do as a young Jarhead and uh yeah seeing these older folks who are not taking their age lying down and taking their training very seriously it's just uh very admirable and you know you see much younger people start complaining some 30-year-old comes I'm aging I'm getting older what should I do it's like what's wrong with you son you know yeah I completely agree these are inspiring stories truly inspiring and people of all ages should pay attention it's um not done in one Leap there's the progressive nature to it and I think not training to failure um just is resurface in my mind now as we have this discussion you know the idea isn't to to grind it's to just Grease the groove get in there and do it as a that's right practice actually I I'm going to change my language around this I realize that when I call it a practice as a as a noun it's not as effective as practice as a verb I'm going to practice okay not that just for me this is just my own internal thing you know my neuroses insist that I share this but I do think that semantics are important as you pointed out before because it has a lot to do with how uh we feel about ourselves um and what we think are we're capable of um it starts with being inspired to try something but also like I didn't grow up in a particularly athletic family um you know not none of us are unathletic but I didn't think I could be you know reasonably strong have decent endurance and I wouldn't consider myself an athlete by any stretch but um you were being too modest but my consistency like I have I have confidence in like if I bite down into something there's a good chance I'm going to do it for the next 30 Years well in consistency my uh my friend uh Jim Wright who passed uh he used to say consistency over intensity and that that's absolutely true if you're doing if you're doing things correctly with proper form if you do it over and over you will win over long term which also interesting kind of brings me to an interesting point you made me think of the long-term development athletic development here's what I'd like to see in an perfect world nobody is tried that yet but I imagine a strength athlete starting out using the Soviet system and later by the way the Russian powerlifting team uses exactly the same training methodology derived from that which means you training many times a week let's say Squad four or five days a week and uh you're doing a lot of reps with this moderate effort and you do this for for years and you achieve high level and then at some point you switch to this American powerlifting system because your skills are already fully home and you fully adapted to the type of stimulus that that first system brings and you switch switch to this once a week cycling method it would be very interesting to see what uh what would happen how far one could go so folks in your 20s and 30s get going on it now and we'll have a podcast in a couple of decades to check back uh send us a note or put in the comments I'd love to talk about body weight training I love love love the book Nam Naked Warrior thank you uh I got that book initially because in the early days of starting my laboratory I was traveling a ton and I didn't always have access to gyms and I wanted to try and grease the groove when I arrived in my room in the middle of the night in Germany or whatever so um I still have not succeeded in doing pistol squats on both legs one is I have some dominant and weakness as it were um but I without any natural strength ability uh to speak of uh was able to learn one arm push-ups um uh one arm pull-ups I'm not there now I have to return to that level of of upper body strength um but it's remarkable what one can do with body weight training and you describe some really beautiful progressions in the book I highly recommend this book folks um so maybe we could just take the push-up as an example and a handstand push-up as the extreme of that right um what I love so much about that book is for in you talk about doing a push-up against the a wall is trivially easy for most people doing a handstand push-up free free standing very difficult but there's a series PR of progressions in between that maybe you could describe to us that once you realize that oh I can work through this over time and if I'm not in a rush to get through it and I just do these a few times a week or more ah or a few times a day a few times a week or more I could do a handstand push-up freestanding or a pistol Squad or a one arm pushup or a one-arm pullup it's not outside one's reach at all absolutely yeah so could you fill in some of the gaps that so getting people to think about the the kind of physics of this and the principles behind it it's such a valuable system and and one that um is a lot of fun too before talking about the system Andrew may I speak about the relative benefits of different types of resistance please okay yeah so the body weight resistance I'm going to talk about uh body weight kettle bells and barbells and obviously there are other things as well but you know it's going to take too long so body weight training the great advantage of body weight is its accessibility so you can do a pushup absolutely anywhere so that is that's a really huge selling point because for some people somebody who travels all the time and uh somebody who's in places where gyms are not available so that's that's a great asset some people just simply enjoy it greatly that's that's just fine the downside of body weight training is it's a lot harder to learn these skills than it is let's say to learn some many cbell skills or even some barbell skills so it seems very innocent and so easy but the uh it may take time to really get some of this so that may take time to do it long may might take a longer time the beautiful thing about the barbell is uh well for first of all the satisfaction of lifting really heavy stuff some people find it extremely satisfying if you don't maybe it's not for you but if you do it's it's incredible then the ability to adjust adjust the weights in small increments so you can prescribe 87.5% one W Max and you can do that you cannot do that with body weight in fact with body weight it's very hard to calibrate resistance that's another one of the problems because you do need to have some skills figure out the regressions and progressions how to do that and and uh the other thing the other great benefit of the barbell is some of the lifts especially the three power lifts allow you to make great gains in strengths and if you choose muscle mess with a very low volume it's uh it's possible to do three sets of five once a week in the squat and get very strong try to do that with pistols it's just not going to happen so reasons for that we can speculate we know some reasons we don't know others but it it is what it is the beauty of the cattle Bell for strength specifically is it's very easy to teach the body language of strength of the cattle Bell you would think that with a with a body weight it should be easier because a lot of the skills that I teach in uh in my book The Naked Warrior they are either gymnastics or martial arts based so it's like okay here's the hollow position from gymnastics or here's this little trick from uh heart style martial arts so there all both use body weight nevertheless it's it's takes a lot more processing to figure out how to do this right from scratch like especially Contracting your abs properly especially if you don't have ABS to start with by the time you have them that's good but if you don't have them it's hard with a kettle bell for example you take uh you start doing double front squats with a pair of kettle bells it's going to be like zerchers you're going to your abdominal wall is going to light up you suddenly learn exactly oh this is what it means to get tight or you stick your elbows inside the knees and do goblet squat oh this is what the proper proper squat feels like and just very easy to uh very easy to integrate uh integrate all your body in one lift and there is an an apparent disadvantage of the kettle bell which also can be an advantage there's no you can program 87 and a half% body weight I mean one rep max because kettle bells jump in large you know like for example from 53 to 70 lbs for example that's a big jump and uh I mean these days some companies will manufacture kettle bells with small like you know small jumps what's the point you are defeating some of the uh reasons for the being for this particular piece of equipment and uh here's what they are one is Simplicity you only can have a couple bills and do a lot of things but the other is when you go when you suddenly let's say that you've been pressing a 53b kettle bell and you're doing a lot of sets and your goal is to press a 70lb kettle bell and it's a big jump so what you're going to do is first of all you're going to have to put in a very significant volume of work that foundation of the pyramid many strength uh authors throughout history bill star and many others use that analogy of volume as being the foundation of the pyramid you're going to have to press that 24 Kil many times properly before you're going to have a run at 70 you have to develop the confidence the other thing is you're going to have to acquire the skill of tension total body tension everything is linked up because when you go up couple pounds it doesn't make a difference you're doing the same thing you're not noticing when you go up a lot everything has to be just so so as you're doing going through your sets of five with a 53 pounder you're also doing just cleans with a 70 pounder you're starting to see what it feels like you're doing getups with it you're starting to see acquiring see how that weight feels like again we're talking about dis inhibition here you're planning and owing this weight so you're forced to put in a very significant volume of work which mean which is very healthy it will lead to a lot of really healthy adaptations and you will force to develop the skills to make that transition and plus you're also having that desirable difficulty in skill in learning the there is that concept by Robert Bor about desirable difficulties for learning if uh learning is very easy something is presented you don't learn much if you have to struggle like even if you're reading something and a font is ineligible ironically you end up learning better so that's is an example of a desirable difficulty as you're progressing this way so that is for strength obviously gettle Bill have their benefits for for endurance and for for other things as well but just for adjusting the resistance often times it's just a matter of preference and a matter of accessibility so I'm not going to say you pick this tool you pick that tool you pick the other tool but if you decide to pick the body weight uh my recommendation would be just be ready patient for a long road because you have to patiently learn these little subtleties of micromanaging your body again you watch the body language of gymnasts you watch the sunin in uh uh some styles of karate and you'll see that amazing uh linking of the different parts of the body into the one chain how the tension is used so it's um it's very rewarding but I would say that's probably the most attention demanding even though it seems so innocent and so simple and so safe but it Demands a lot of attention but if you that's your speed and if you enjoy practice true practice that's that's a great way to go I haven't explored kettle bell training so much whenever I've tried the standard kettle bell swing just kind of if there is such a thing but you know between the legs two-handed kettle bell swing I tended to get some right side uh lower back pain medial glute thing and I'm sure I'm not doing it correctly and I um I've wanted to learn Kettle belts properly you have an online Kettle belt course yes uh we do have several resources so we have the uh book kettle bell simple and Sinister we which is available on Amazon we have uh an online course under the same name we also obviously have uh uh workshops live instructors that you can find locally at our website strong first but I can tell you that of course some people are not supposed to do swings as is true for every exercise for example in McGill's work say some people who have problem with Shear sometimes they might have issues but a great great number of people majority people can do swings very successfully we have seen some really pretty broken people when they're clear to do that and when they're coached properly the big issue is you have to hip hinge not lift the gettle bell with your back or with your arms and for that we have very very specific progressions you cannot go move Beyond this until you do this okay here you are doing this particular hip hinge drill with no weight okay good you got that down now you're going to do a cattle Bell deadlift which is just a you know Sumo deadlift with a light kettle bell then you're going to progress with a very particular type of Swing so it's about patience but the benefits are really worth it so what are the benefits let's say of the cattle Bell swings as opposed to or snatches again snatch is more of a less Democratic exercise like the dips parallel bar dips fantastic for those who can do that but you know if you can that's too bad but there are alternatives so again the snatch is great if you cannot do snatch you can do swing so the swing it allows you to train power and power endurance in extremely safe manner because if you try to develop power in a lot of conventional ways uh you will find like okay you try doing Olympic lifts it's very skill intensive trying to learn how to do that and besides for some athlet it's not appropriate racking the bar and uh overstretching the wrist ligaments like for example for Fighters that's a kiss of death that's a really bad idea to stabilizing the wrist in this manner and for many athletes other athletes too you know pitcher doesn't want to do that baseball pitcher so high you know then you try to do things like sprinting Sprinter requires a lot of coaching proper coaching much more than a kettle bell swing and it's very very easy to rip a hamstring or something like that so it's this kettle bell swing allows you to train power and power endurance at the very safe Manner and what's also very unique about it you don't have to use a lot of weight what's unique about the kettle bell and kbell swing and another thing about the design you can swing it back between your legs but you don't have to let it passively s swing between your legs you can choose to accelerate it this is called over speed eccentric so some years back uh our colleague one of our instructors Brandon hler he put uh me and several other uh our colleagues instructors on the force plate and we started doing Swings with over speed Ecentric which means accelerating in downwards and upwards so we were using just a 53b bell so the most experienced guys we were able to generate over 10 GS of acceleration so basically we made that 50 lb Bell weigh 500 lb but if uh to the listeners who know about how uh how the tissues how the passive tissues can handle the load when the loading is really rapid it's amazing how these tissues can handle it very very safely so you can apply tremendous amount of load of course you don't start with that it's not how you start your swings so and you can develop power endurance so you can do a whole lot of different many different sets many sets you've had Megan Kelly VAB our uh certified instructors out of UK you know she said a Guinness World Record for a crazy number of swings done in an hour and uh so she would just go her training is she would go and do swings uh she would do a few reps pick up set it down and she would do it for let's say 90 minutes and she would do it with a heavy kettle bell and the adaptations are fantastic from that in the kettle Bill world we referred to W the hell effect so what's the what the hell effect what the hell effect is when you're getting an adaptation that's not a beginner's gain but it's an adaptation that's totally unexpected there's some collateral benefit how suddenly you're able you're able to do something and uh the improvements in Fat Loss improvements in resilience so res like for example speaking of resilience so some of the Tactical teams that I worked with in us here when they added either swings or snatches to their training with the kettle bell plus one-legged uh kettle bell deadlifts as well they sto tearing their hamstrings so you have this amazing way to do Ecentric loading for the hamstring but it's very safe and just really prepares you uh one of my friends he's still playing baseball in the 60s he says thank you for the kettle bells you know he went through the course in what a federal agencies 20 years ago and he's still doing that he's retired but he's still he's still doing that so that's a great benefit the amount of pure workload that you can do in this amount that's why you can burn a lot of calories you can uh develop cardio whatever but also like why would anybody want to do power training who's not a power athlete because for so many reasons right now I don't need to speak about it that your other guests have for the reasons of longevity how important it is to to have high levels of power and uh the cattle Bill swing is one of the ways one of the ways to develop it and interestingly enough going back like you know these acceleration patience uh Professor Yakov Nikolai Yakov LIF up Soviet biochemist he was just talking about Sprints during added Sprints when you were adding Sprints just to a jog you know this kind of a fart like work he was saying how important how good it is for elderly and for teenagers how good it is so the cattle Bill even if you're not sprinting if you don't know how to sprint you're able to get so many of this uh youth promoting benefits and again you have one tool that can train all the qualities you can develop Mobility you know the bent press That's a tremendous exercise the bent press where the mobility of the t-spine the uh mobility of the shoulder so like you were watch and uh watch for example uh Dr uh Dr Pope Mosley he is one of our instructors and he's also a a doctor and bed researcher I mean the gentleman is 70 years old and he's doing this beautiful bent presses getting himself in the range of motion that young guys you know on phones can possibly get into and is's doing it in a healthy manner so you can develop Mobility you can develop strength you can develop endurance and uh resilience in all one one package so obviously I'm biased and I'm not saying it's the only way to go but that's one relative benefit uh one of the many relative benefits of kettle bells but in the overall lifelong journey like if you're looking at three things right now your newest strength what should I start with I would say start with the kettle bell it's the best entry point we find it so easy to start coaching people in powerlifting or transition to some body weight strengths after training them with kettle bells it's uh it's extremely easy because they've got that body weight language of strength down I'm going to have a few questions uh in the upcoming months about kettle bells I'll try not to bother you too many times but I'll I'll uh thank you I'll use the course as a guide but I I'm determined to to derive some of these benefits of of kettle bells because uh kettle bells have been around me for for over a decade now um and I I just haven't quite taken to them not through some aversion but I'm I'm going to approach it correctly I love the body weight work um the body weight work um I don't know maybe it's takes me back to PE class when I was in high school or something when we do these fit fit tests um is usually some pull-ups some push-ups a reach and a and a run or something like that like a like a you straight-legged uh tow reach who knows if it's a meaningful metric but in any case um something so satisfying about going from struggling with push-ups to being able to do a one-arm push-up or something like that um and you describe it in in how to make that progression in the book for people me just to interrupt you and it's also cool that you're a bigger guy and you're doing that this is what I love to see and we're seeing that as strong first a lot we'll have to see uh bigger guys and gals getting into the body weight exercises because that's not typical of their strength we like to see skinny people getting into the barbell and just go against like for example seeing somebody like uh Dr Mike hardle one of our Master instructors you know he's a former American bench brass record holder and coach for the powerlifting Team USA I mean watching him do one push-ups you got to love that stuff because normally big guys hate body weight work it's humbling and little guys hate barbell and we just get and not just guys women we have we have these ladies these skinny little ladies lifting amazing weights that's just always awesome to see that it is awesome and I love that strength training resistance training is starting to really make a showing here in the US and the general public I think it's one of the best things to happen in the last few years and this discussion uh your knowledge is going to put even more momentum behind if I just made to guide people just briefly on a very high level uh great news you have so many choices bad news you have too many choices so pick one program with an established track record and just stick with it and follow it for a long time do not try to over customize everything Daniel conman spoke how much algorithms outperform humans so often I've seen this over and over how a properly designed strength program or endurance program that was uh generic design but with certain uh you know feedback loops in there okay if this happens you have to go back and make some changes deliver much better results and customized programs very often so find something that's simple find something that does not have a lot of moving parts and uh and just stick with this for a long time if it's working do not look for the for the next thing because the next thing maybe it's as good maybe not but also do keep in mind that every time you change gears you lose momentum uh you know you're uh you're a neuroscientist I don't know if you spoke to your audience about the law of neural Darwinism but the there's a competition between the synaptic sites so you the pathways so you can only do so many things well so a child can do everything but not but poorly but as we get older some you know some of these Pathways get pruned but others get reinforced and unfortunately we can't excel at everything so there's this classic example uh with and not just physically mentally as well cognitively as well this classic example with taxi drivers uh back in the days for GPS taxi capab drivers they were supposed to pass an extremely challenging test how to navigate through the city that was not designed to be navigated through and uh they found that uh certain part of their hippocampus was more developed than than in others and so this you know so they thought well maybe it's just pre pre-election maybe whoever made it through the test were the guys with more muscular Hampe you know and then they monitored then they monitored two groups of students over several years and they said they start with the same size and in the group that passed there brains so to say got bigger in that port and the others they didn't okay but then at the same time in a different test of a different test of memory the the guys who passed the test they were not so good so they lost something in the process it's just life it's uh many things in life for zero some game you want to seek some balance up to a point but they're comes a point where you know you cannot do it all we are limited in time we're limited in our adaptive capacity yeah Amen to that and I appreciate you highlighting the London cab drivers uh experiment um your your knowledge of Neuroscience is truly impressive you're way to jous thank you no it's true uh no other guest on here has discussed long-term depression which uh it's uh my dad said andw you know something my dad early on that is good things happen at Junctions of fields if you always stay exactly just in your own narrow field and you're just you know it just the same thing is repeated but when you start going to somewhere else a little bit outside as adjacent whether it's Neuroscience whether it's okay how do they you know what are the martial arts skills how do the martial artists do for striking or somewhere else I think that just really interesting to kind of Step a little bit outside your comfort zone and sometimes you see patterns that's what happens your father's a smart smart man thank you kids and young people training uh I don't know what the going word is now as to whether or not there's a you know too young to to resistance train age you know some people say there isn't um when I was growing up it was thought that if you squatted heavy or you deadlifted heavy before you reached your um natural uh limits of your height that it could quote unquote stunt your growth like your comments on that but based on what we were just talking about it seems that if a young person is interested in developing a super skill in one area one sport okay but there's a real trade-off to that and perhaps what we should do as kids um is a little bit of soccer a little bit of swimming little bit gymn gymnastics seems like a wonderful all-around sport maybe a little archery you know try a bunch of things some ballet you know try try well that's the time to do that that's explos that neurodiversity and the things that you can possibly do and then find the things that you click with and for the physical body early specialization destroys athletes it is really terrible because early on kids absolutely need to do a wide variety of different activities and really pursue a fairly balanced development you know there may be a biased towards strength or biased towards endurance but they really need to do it all and uh specialist athletes break they they break they're really do so that balance between General and specific uh it's a tough balance yeah and psychologically sometimes too we had a guest on here who's uh become a psychologist but she was a concert level uh violin player then injured her finger and it was like the most devastating thing you know when we put all of our sort of identity into one thing um sure you get your Michael Jordan's and you get your uh Tiger Woods's and that's and seriously there's no right answer or wrong answer so I remember um Ivan AB badv who was a head coach for the Bulgarian weightlifting team he says if Paganini played whatever instrument you know in addition to his own instrument playing in 15 hours a day he would not have become Pagan and that's true but I'm not saying that specialization is necessarily the right choice for everybody some Some people prefer to be decent in many things and it is healthy but you still have to decide you still have to make decisions very much you're looking like at a budget do I want to buy a couch or do you want to go on a vacation to Italy or do I want to go on a much Lamer vacation and buy a Lamer couch and do both and I'm not saying what's the right answer right there but just people do have to understand there are there are limitations they can't successfully compete into two sports for example it's not going to happen especially if it's a power sport an endurance Sport and uh they can't study everything to a high level just just as well if you want to be polymath that could that that was fine in the 18th century right now it's a little bit tougher yeah a previous guest you may know him Josh weit skin of uh you know chess PR G Fame he's gone on to do several things um at world uh class level by severing from the previous uh Endeavor completely he hasn't picked up a chess piece since he was 16 which is remarkable pivoting to other things but when one looks at the data on uh child prodigies very few of them are like Josh most of them don't actually succeed in doing anything else at a very high level except hopefully survive and thrive in their personal life who knows um after being Ultra successful as a young child probably because their nervous system is so you know they greas the groove so heavily for one Endeavor it's very hard to cross over Josh is exceptional in that regard well exceptions prove the rule usually exactly um not to say too mechanical and specific but I'd love to talk about abdominal or rather core work sure uh another thing that I love in the Naked Warrior are the abdominal exercises I must tell you um after years of doing some crunches here and there in different you know for whatever this class or that class or trying to I never really cared about having my abs defined um for its own sake one should probably be uh able to at least contract their abs okay it's a the level of we assess them by punching them right right right exactly but there's some wonderful exercises in there about learning to brace the entire body and some um dare I say some uh rather um unorthodox ways of assessing stability at the level of the core I'm thinking about the the plank where somebody tries to either kick you over or push you over this might sound violent this is not where you start folks kind of gentle but I never thought I could do like hanging Pikes for instance and like now Pikes are a standard part of my weekly routine I love doing five sets of five of hanging Pikes and um and I will tell anyone that decides to go down this path that when I first tried to do a pike I failed miserably I um tried an elseit failed miserably tried to the you know hang from the bar and just getting into a chair position and could just barely hold that the progressions are what matter right slow progression and patience now now five sets of five Pikes trivial for me but when I I just want to emphasize that when I started I was far far away from that and it's the progressions in the book that really helped me and I've maintained that Pike ability so thank you for that and I say it not not to necessarily um to highlight what I can do but that to highlight what I do believe most anybody can do if you put the work they can't if they put a lot of attention in so uh midsection training is one of the most misunderstood messed up areas of physical culture there's a thousand different exercises and people like oh you got to have variety this many reps that's not the point the point really is tension and attention so that's those are the two things and uh ideally your best first step is really learning abdominal tension through something like a zercher squat or double Kettle bille front squat where the load distribution is such that it forces reflexive stabil ization and you feel oh that's what tide ABS feel like and getting somebody just weak in a plank it's hopeless there's absolutely not going to help it's not there are ways of building up to it yes by Rolling in the back and so on so but if you don't have that option or if you choose not to exercise it you have to be extremely attentive to the details of what's going on with on your abdomen so you need to learn things like for example you need to learn to contract the pelvic diaphragm pull your butt up because you're trying to con you know trying to constrain the intraabdominal pressure then you need to learn how to direct attention to the different parts of your abdomen almost like a body bodybuilder but really not quite more like a gymnast there is this argument about in strength World about you know internal Focus external focus and queuing and the agreement is in Mortal learning well external focus queuing is so much better than focusing on you know whatever happens within the individual muscle it may be true in the beginning and maybe through outside of the strength game but any top strength athlete that you will meet they have their own internal cues how they do something later on they may forget them it Des spires and you know but they know how to this is how this is how I Engage The lat in the in the bench press uh George Halbert bench press world record holder famously said it took him many years to finally understand how the triceps is used in the bench press many years so there's a lot of internal component and for the ABS very very very much so you have to learn how to very much direct your attention there to get high tension you have to keep the rep slow like you said five sets of five perfect High Reps are not necessary you're not going to burn off fat by doing more reps you're just going to irritate your back that's all you're going to do nothing else so you treat your app training very much like a like a like a strength strength vent and if you do that uh you're going to get those results and finally the final detail is you need to use that intraabdominal pressure as your friend uh because in lifting like a deadlift or squad or something intraabdominal pressure helps you it supports you when you're doing abdominal work you work against that abdominal pre intraabdominal pressure you're just create that pressure and contract again it this is something called internal isometrics so it's kind of interesting it's just a combination of a classic strength work with very internalized kind of almost like a martial art approach to it then you need to learn also how to obviously use your abs in lifts and lifting and once you do and this is the beauty you don't really have to train your abs anymore so Franco Columbo for example great example in addition to winning you know being super strong strong and winning Mr Olympia he won the best abs he didn't train ABS he said he told me I hate AB training he just would stay tight whenever he did his heavy lifts and this is pretty much what happens when you reach a certain level of strength and a certain level of awareness simply staying tight during your strength work and also employing power breathing which is very important uh you're going to be able to to get as strong as as you need in the ABS and get your six-pack or whatever provid it you know you don't need the Twinkies so how do you pressurize the in fact may I show an abdominal exercise right now that is just sitting at this table that's also going to teach you how uh teach your audience how to properly pressurize for lifting so normally it's better Down Standing so and it's not for people with high blood pressure heart concerns you know check with your doctor if that's the situation so you take a normal breath in your abdomen and you uh pull up your butt pretty much like imagine you have to go to the restroom and you trying to you can't quite you know it's far away you're trying to stop yourself then you put your tongue between your teeth and you start and you start hissing and you do this in this ratcheting kind of manner so try to keep old the pressure out of your head out of your neck direct old the pressure it all this pressure is just you're really staying below and so this type of hissing you will notice that very rapidly you're going to contract everything around your waist so everything around your waist is is going to contract and you're going to stain your abdomen you're also going to start learn how to properly how to properly stabilize yourself under under heavy weights the difference between using this technique for lifting and for just training the ABS when you're training the ABS there's going to be some spinal flexion not a whole lot you don't want to do a lot of that there's going to be some spinal flexion when you're doing that under a heavy barbell squat you're maintaining your spine is neutral it's like your body stays a cylinder and um you're going to hold your breath pretty much but the idea is the same so it's like so the Val Sala maneuver one uh Russian coach called it it's it's an ex it's a it's an exhalation that didn't happen Okay because people don't know hold their breath properly they just and then eyes are bulging out well there's no stability right here so first of all you got to inhale low and how do you do that if you watch top lifters how they do that they will do it through purse lips you can also do it through the nose but you cannot do it through big wide open mouth so I'll show you why so if you you can you folks can try it at home so if you put your hand on your stomach and trying to do an abdominal breath doesn't go very well now for contrast pinch off one nostril take an abdominal breath or you can do that through P lips try it again so you see more resistance more resistance and again you're engaging the diaphragm instead of just uh just your uh thorax right there so you take that breath into your abdomen in like through a small opening through your nose or through through your Pur lips you draw it in right there and then you know down below you pull it pull it up and then after that it's that that exhalation that didn't happen do you see I so I I'm familiar with sort of bracing my abs what I've not done before is the uh resisting going to the bathroom thing that you mentioned the pulling up of the butt and then and then so you're creating compression from the bottom and from the top and also from all around that happens reflexively as well I see so that's the position to get into before say like a a hard a zercher squat or something like that ABS absolutely and if you're doing that for an exercise that's long long in duration you know if you don't want to be holding your breath too long then uh we have an expression that comes from one of The KES tiles breathing behind the shield so so right now I can speak to you but I'm still just as ti so you see what you're doing so the way we tested it our the where we teach it in our workshops is you lie on the ground I tell you to tense up and I'm going to stand on your stomach I'm going to have you sing a song and you're going to have to learn to properly maintain that pressure while still containing containing uh continuing to breathe so you're able to stabilize your spine but you're not going to pass out from maintaining that by uh by holding your breath for a period of time and then finally what you got to learn to do is you got to learn to match the breath with a force so synchronize synchronize when you're punching when you're throwing when you're lifting you have to learn how to match that contraction the timing of the abdominal contraction and the pressurization sometimes exhalation sometimes just pretending to with the effort once you learn how to match the breath of the force it's like magic and what people don't realize it's not just purely mechanical mechanically yes of course it works you know Stu explained this so well about the stiffness of the structure the analogy of the bicycle frame it's the same thing you're getting an expensive bicycle frame when you have strong ABS as opposed to the cheap one that rattles and uh Wiggles but there's also something that it's never never spoken about in the West for some reason the Soviet studied that decades ago this is something they called uh the numo maatic reflex numo is p Neu m o so air so there are barer receptors receptors uh for sensors for pressure inside your abdominal cavity and thoracic cavity so whenever these receptors are stimulated what they do they automatically increas the sensitivity of alpha Mona neurons so which really means to the audience is this if you imagine your brain is the music player and imagine your muscle is uh is a speaker the amount of intraabdominal pressure is your volume control so by by increasing that pressure you're increasing the strength but by by releasing that intraabdominal pressure you relax the muscle so that's why in stretch as I mentioned before you can be sitting in a half split and groaning no you need to release if you release that passive breath again you're going to your muscles are going to relax so controlling your breath is uh very much as it's known in martial arts it's very much synonymous with controlling your body and your mind very often fantastic when one throws a punch um is it true that exhalent sh is actually providing additional power no question about it yeah it's been it's been measured it's been measured on Fighters uh it's also been measured in lifting as well there was a study that was done in the west even when screaming increases strength significantly and again this is not just a psychological component I mean there may be some psychological component to that but again there's this very distinct uh increase of strength through through uh through that through that reflex and it's very easy for the uh listeners to test that get a dynamometer hand gripper and just test yourself on that and just see test it out on different uh with different breathing patterns and just see what happens and whenever you know this idiotic practice at some gyms oh you can grunt right here and it's just well I guess you can be strong here and yeah of course if you're doing this on purpose you're walking in with the Bros and you're just trying to just to make noise to attract attention that's wrong but uh strength is a noisy Endeavor so there may be some hissing there maybe some grunting it's uh it's just absolutely unavoidable and it's uh if if you're if you're trying to be quiet and if you're trying to be a lady or a gentleman well maybe it's not for it's for it's for somewhere else not for the gym so some potentially uh trivial questions but I think they are not trivial uh I hope they're not in any case where should we place our eyes when we're in exertion um close our eyes and grind it out look at form in the mirror I'm a big fan of gyms without mirrors yes because I have to concentrate on the form um vision is a powerful tool and and source of feedback but also um a source of a lot of things there must be a rule about this or at least a set of guidelines for uh are we eyes closed and grimacing are we um checking our uh bicep vein in the mirror just kidding don't do that folks um during a lift where should our eyes be is there any idea that looking up it makes it easier to drive up out of the bottom of a squat has this been explored well there it has there are several there's several sides to that part of it is the uh spinal safety so Stu will tell you that extending the neck is going to facilitate the entire posterior chain and he also tell you that lifters with longer necks may be able to get their heads up and uh that might work better for them uh for some other lifters especially those with pronounced lard dois where they're very Arch big arch in the back that may Arch them too much that might be inappropriate or it just kinged their neck it's it's all possible and uh so a lot of coaches these days and left like a deadlift they try to including uh Andy Bolton Andy Bolton he's the legend AR deadlifter he's the one the first uh lifter to lift over 1,000 lbs in the deadlift and Andy and I we co-authored the book The deadlift Dynamite so Andy's got the most beautiful deadlift just the most incredible beautiful deadlift so Andy what Andy does is pretty much what the standard recommendation for most people is these days where you're maintaining a neutral neck and your eyes kind of go with that so you get yourself in the position you know on the bottom the deadlift like where you head is the continuation of your body like you're an insect or something and then you look at the spot on the ground that's appropriate and your eyes will come up so that's a good general standard recommendation for people with long necks looking straight ahead it's it's a good recommendation some lifters succeed with crazy ideas Lamar Gant that again pound per pound the biggest dead lifter he was in tremendous hyperextension he was looking at the ceiling uh then at a high level of competition there are some other subtle ways uh some things people try so Constantin Constantino from laia he was another great deadlifter who passed he uh he would look down at the start he would look absolutely down he was pretty much uh and if you look at um if you look at it from your perspective when your neck is in flection interesting enough that facilitates the KN extens which is really really weird yeah and uh I my chin towards my chest uh not all the way down but yeah yeah you will find that your quads are going to be stronger yeah but it's not for everybody for somebody else that's a great way to mess up mess up the back so there are some there's some subtleties and there are also some people who really get fancy with the Eyes eye movement you know follow the bar do these other things like I count from gymnastics good rule of thumb is uh if you look straight ahead more often than not you're going to be okay but from that there are a lot of fancy ways to do it as for for closing your eyes closing your eyes is not recommended it changes the coordination of the lift but for advanced lifters lifting blindfolded is a really good idea so Robert Roman one of the top Soviet uh Specialists he pioneered that and you would have his lifters do some of the sets blindfolded and it's really amazing at how much not relying on your vision relying your can aesthetic sense what that does it's uh it's quite remarkable and also just to add one more thing and a competition at least in powerlifting a lot of uh I mean the top guys they don't see anything really you know they're just deep inside their rage they're not it's a total tunnel vision auditory exclusion everything so it's uh whatever they had some they had in whatever remembered position but don't ask him to look at you or see you it's not going to happen they're someplace else yep paav I must say this has been a spectacular Voyage Through you're very kind Andrew has been uh it's been a real pleasure very a very stimulating conversation oh thank you and um I'm going to just embarrass you a little bit further by by telling you more uh positive things about you um uh because I notice it makes you uncomfortable it's perhaps the only thing that makes you uncomfortable but in all seriousness I don't think I can't sense any discomfort I I want to just thank you for a number of things that are reflective I'm sure of what other people are thinking first of all the level of rigor that you've approached this whole thing of strength and fitness and flexibility and breathing and you know every one of these topics too many to list off just now is it's remarkable it's really fantastic I love my job so that's that's easy this comes through and um and it's rare these days but it's rare in any age to find people that are so dedicated to um this level of rigor in a given area and and it's so appreciate coming for me it means a lot thank yeah we really we need people like you you're you're truly a scientist and a practitioner you embody the principles that you um discuss clearly which is also important if I could blush I would right Russians don't blush no no got it um a topic for another podcast so that the the rigor and the quality of the information that you put forth in your books and on this podcast and elsewhere uh your online course is just absolutely spectacular and I hope people noticed you know I couldn't help but notice as an as an academic but your attention to proper attribution for people that have done the work and accomplished the various Feats from whom you've gleaned various aspects of this knowledge is not to be overlooked because that's something that's so lacking these things it it's just it's so it's it's remarkable and it's important to highlight it should go without saying it really shouldn't it yeah it should go without saying but it doesn't you know these days it's more about who can glean the most attention as opposed to shed light on others and um and there work um and in doing so as uh as we've observed there's absolutely nothing is lost and so much is gained it's for everybody so thank you that that's a proper attribution is is spectacular and I really look forward to um sharing the resources where people can learn more but already today you've just provided such a wealth of knowledge for us and um it's a real honor to sit here with you and to learn from you I plan to listen to this podcast several times over and and take detailed notes uh we timestamp it all and and I just hope that we'll have the opportunity at some point to sit down again um and as well perhaps uh to get the opportunity to train together uh so I personally could learn from you but in the meantime on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching thank you ever so much Pavo you're thank you Andrew you're real pleasure you're a real and thank you for spreading the spreading the word of health and strength strength and health wonderful thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion with patulin I

Title: The Science of Emotions & Relationships | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2025-02-06 13:01:15 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods, focusing on how development and neurochemicals shape our feelings and relationships.

I describe how early infant bonds and puberty shape adult patterns of emotional connection. I explain that understanding emotions requires recognizing both internal states and external cues, along with strategies to enhance your emotional awareness. Additionally, I discuss the key elements of healthy emotional bonds and provide practical tools to deepen one’s understanding of emotions, leading to a richer emotional life. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

welcome to hubman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and [Music] performance my name is Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine so let's talk about emotions emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect of our life experience it's fair to say that emotions make up most of what we think of as our experence of life even the things we do our behaviors and the places we go and the people we end up encountering in our life all of that really funnels into our emotional perception of what those things mean whether or not they made us happy or sad or depressed or lonely or we awe inspiring now one thing that is absolutely true is that everyone's perception of emotion is slightly different meaning your idea of happy is very likely different than my idea of what a state of happiness is and we know this also for color vision for instance even though the cells in your eye and my eye that perceive the color red are identical right down to the genes that they express we can be certain based on experimental evidence and what are called psychophysical studies that your idea of the most intense red is going to be very different than my idea of the most intense red if we were given a selection of 10 different Reds and asked which one is most intense which one looks most red and that seems crazy you would think that something as simple as color would be Universal and yet it's not and so we need to agree at the outset that emotions are complicated and yet they are tractable they can be understood and today we're going to talk about a lot of tools to understand what emotions are for you to understand what your emotional states mean and what they don't mean and in doing that that will allow you to place value on whether or not you should hold an emotional state as true or not true whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't as well as whether or not the emotions of others are important to you in a given context we're going to talk a lot about development in fact we're going to center a lot of our discussion today around infancy and puberty we're also going to talk about tools for enhancing one's emotional range and for navigating difficult emotional situations I'm not a clinical psychologist I'm not a therapist but I do have some background in Psychology and today I'm going to be drawing from the psychology greats not me but from the greats of psychology who studied emotion who studied emotional development and linking that to the Neuroscience of emotion because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals and the hormones and the neural circuits in the brain and body that underly emotion so while there's no one single universally true theory of emotion at the intersection of many of the existing theories there are really some ground truths if we want to understand emotions we have to look at where emotions first develop and the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows is that if you want to understand what a part of the brain does you have to address two questions you have to know what connections does that brain area make and you need to know what's called the developmental origin of that structure what are the brain areas for emotion and nowadays there's a lot of debate about this for years it was thought that there might be circuit meaning Connections in the brain that generate the feeling of being happy or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad Etc that's been challenged and yet I think there's good evidence for circuits in the brain such as lyic circuits and other circuits that shift our overall States or our overall level of alertness or calmness or whether or not they bias us toward viewing the outside world or paying more attention to what's going on inside our bodies but the important thing to understand is that emot do arise in the brain and body and if we want to understand how emotions work we have to look how emotions are built and they are built during infancy adolescence and puberty and then it continues into adulthood but the groundwork is laid down early in development when we are small children you were born into this world without really any understanding of the things around you now there are two ways that you can interact with the world and you're always doing them more or less to some degree at the same time those are interoception paying attention to what's going on inside you what you feel internally and exteroception paying attention to what's going on outside you hold that in mind please because the fact that you're both intercepting and exter accepting is true for your entire life and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions it's absolutely critical as an infant you didn't have any knowledge of what you needed you didn't understand hunger you didn't understand cold or heat or any of that when you needed something you experience that as anxiety you would feel an increase in alertness if you had to use the bathroom you would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry and you would vocalize you would cry out you would act agitated you might coup you might do a number of different things and then your caregiver whoever that might have been would respond to that so this is actually really important to understand that a baby when you were a baby and when I was a baby we didn't have any sense of the outside world except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially all developmental psychologists agree that babies lack the ability to make cognitive sense of the outside world but in this feeling of anxiety and registering one's own internal State and then crying out to the outside world either through crying or subtle vocalizations or even just cing making some noise we start to develop a relationship with the outside world in which our internal States our shifts and anxiety start to drive requests and people come and respond to those requests and this gets to the basis of what emotions are about which are emotions are really about forming bonds and being able to predict things in the world and at this point I actually just want to pause and mention a really interesting tool that is trying to address this question of what are emotions and what do they consist of that you can use if you like this is an app I didn't develop it I don't have any relationship to them but the app was developed by people at Yale and it's called mood meter what they're trying to do is put more Nuance more subtlety on our words and our language for for emotions and be able to to allow you to predict how you're going to feel in the future I'm on the app right now and I know you can't see this but it's called mood meter you know it says to me hi Andrew how are you right now and I click the little tab that says I feel and I can either pick high energy and unpleasant high energy and pleasant low energy unpleasant or low energy Pleasant and I would say right now I feel high energy Pleasant so I just revealed to you how I feel so I click on that and then it gives you a gallery of colors and you just move your finger to the location where you think it matches most and as you do that little words pop up so say motivated cheerful inspired I would say I'm feeling right now cheerful so you click that and then you just go to the next window and it just says what are you doing and I this feels like play to me but I'm going to call it work and then that's it and then um what it does is it basically starts to collect data on you you're giving it information and it starts to link that to other features that you allow it access to if you like and it starts helping you be able to predict how you're going to feel at different times a day and it points to a couple really interesting features which is that we don't really have enough language to describe all the emotional states and yet there's some core truths to what makes up an emotion this can really help people kids and adults understand better what they're feeling and why and when best to engage in certain activities and thankfully when best to avoid certain activities too so the way this works is the following you need to ask yourself at any point you could do this right now if you like what's your level of autonomic arousal autonomic arousal is just the Continuum the range of alert to calm so if you're in a panic right now you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale if you're asleep you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying although maybe a little bit but let's say you're very drowsy you might be at a one or a two and then there's this other axis this other question which is what we call veilance now veilance is a value do you feel good or bad I would say I feel pretty good right now on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm like a I don't know I feel like a seven so I'm alert and I feel pretty good and then there's a third thing which is how much we are intercepting and how much we are excepting all right so how much our attention is focused internally on what we're feeling and how much it's focused exter internally and this is always going to be in a dynamic balance so for instance if you're really really stressed often times that puts you in a position to be really in touch with what's going on in your body if you start having a lot of somatic a lot of bodily Sensations like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it then you're really strongly interceptive so there these three things how alert or sleepy you are that's one how good or bad you feel that's two and then whether or not most of your attention is directed outward or whether or not it's directed Inward and much of what we call emotions are made up by those three things let's return to the infant there's the baby in the crib it's mostly intercepting as caregivers bring it what it needs you hope milk diaper changes Etc a warm blanket if it's cold pull off the blanket when the baby's fussing and it's too warm because babies get too warm also it starts to exter roep the baby starts to look into the outside world and start making predictions it starts wondering how much it needs to cry or predicting well if I cry like a little bit then Mom comes over and I get my milk babies are starting to evaluate and do all this but they're not doing it consciously they're doing this in order to relieve anxiety as a young creature an infant and young toddler you were mainly focused Inward and you started to understand what was going on outward as a way of predicting what would bring you relief what would remove your anxiety and that's where the fundamental rules of your experience your emotional experience were laid down so now let's talk about what kind of baby you were because that actually informs your emotionality now these are classic they're actually famous experiments done by bulby and answorth this is this classic experiment of the what was called The Strange situation task in which and I'm describing it very coarsely here I realize but a mother and child come into the laboratory the baby and the mother or father play together for a bit and then the mother leaves the mother leaves for some period of time and then comes back and the research is devoted to understanding the response of the child when the caretaker the mother or the father returns Balby and answorth and many of their scientific Offspring and colleagues identified at least four patterns that babies display when their caretaker returns and they group these into group a b c d so much so that the kids were referred to as a babies B babies C bab or D babies the first babies are the a babies when their caretaker would return the infant would respond with happiness with what looked like Delight they would go to the caretaker they seemed happy these are referred to as secure attached kids the B babies as they're called were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver when the caregiver would return so they would sometimes continue to play with their toys or they would uh be with the they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone they would stay with them these were referred to as avoidant babies the ca babies would respond to the return of the caregiver with acts of annoyance they seemed kind of angry and those were referred to as ambivalent babies and then the third category the D babies were the disorganized babies the child avoided interactions with everyone and their behavior didn't really change whether or not the caregiver was there or not this work this classic work opened up a huge set of important questions that relate to what is the reestablishment of the bond really about I mean what's actually being figured out here is not whether or not there are four categories of babies that's interesting but it presumably is more interesting to focus on what is it that defines a really good Bond a secure attachment or an insecure attachment or an avoidant attachment and the four things are Gaye literally eye contact VOC vocalizations so what we say how we say it affect or emotion so the way that we express you know crying smiling Etc and touch but gaze vocalization affect and touch are really the core of this thing that we call social bonds and emotionality and it's clear from most all of the theories of emotional health that an ability to recognize when your own internal state is being driven primarily by external events as important for being able to emotionally regulate right people who are constantly being yanked around by the external happenings in the world you would say are emotionally labile they are not in control of their emotions even if they're calm all the time if that calmness only arrives because they're in a Placid environment and then you put you know a cracker in that environment and they freak out well then they're not really calm so how much your the outside environment disrupts your internal internal environment has everything to do with this balance of interception and exter reception and it very likely has roots in whether or not you were secure attached or insecure attached disorganized or ambivalent as a baby so while we can't travel back in time there is an exercise that you can do to address at least in this moment whether or not you have a bias for exteroception or a bias for interoception if you close your eyes right now and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body and trying to bring as much of your attention to that point of contact as possible and then from there you're going to move your attention even more deeply into say the sensation of what's going on in your gut Are You full are you empty are you hungry are you not uh is your heart beating at what rate what's the Cadence of your breathing basically bringing your focus and attention to everything at the surface of your skin and inward so I I'm going to do a rare thing on the hubman Lab podcast I'm going to introduce about 5 to eight seconds of Silence um in order to allow you to do that a little bit now try and do something that for most people actually is a little bit harder which is to purely extero put put your eyes or your ears or both on anything in your immediate space I would say look across the room pick a panel on the wall or a you know a leg of a table or something and try and bring as much of your attention to that as possible and again I'll take about 5 Seconds of Silence to allow you to exospeed it's hard to place 100% of your attention on something externally unless it's really exciting really novel if you've ever watched a really great movie presumably you're exter accepting more than you're intercepting until something exciting happens and then and then you feel something you're actually tethering your emotional experience to something external and now you can also do this dynamically you can decide to focus internally and then externally you can decide to split it 50% 50% or 70 30 one can develop you can develop a heightened ability to do this and the power of doing that is actually that when you are in environments where you feel like you're focused too much internally and you'd like to be focused more externally you can actually do that deliberately but as you notice it takes work these exercises are really what are at the core of these development of emotional bonds because as we mentioned before these four things the gaze vocalization touch and affect those are happening very dynamically so if somebody Winks at you you're paying attention to their wink but then you also notice how you feel this is very Dynamic so if it seems overwhelming to try and intercept and exter and then shift the balance you do that all the time your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this now some people have a very hard time breaking out of a very strongly interceptive mode some people have a harder time breaking out of their extra receptive mode it's very interesting to note the the extent to which we have biases in how interceptive or exter receptive we are remember those three axes that we talked about earlier you have veilance good or bad you have alertness alert or calm and you have interceptive or EXT receptive bias early in development you start off with this interceptive bias you are starting to develop expectations predictions about how the outside world is going to work and you are trying to figure out the reliability of outside events and people and where things are reliable when people are reliable we are able to give up more of our interoception there's literally trust that our interceptive needs our internal needs will be met through bonds and actions of others this starts to Veer toward the discussion about neglect and Trauma we are going to devote entire episodes probably an entire month to trauma and PTSD but these those have roots in what we're talking about now and it's important to internalize and understand what we're talking about now in order to get the most out of those future conversations so now I want to just pause just shove the discussion about interception exter reception for a moment and I want to talk about what is arguably the second most if not equally important aspect of your development as it relates to emotionality and as it relates to this what I called trust but this ability to predict whether or not things in the outside world are reliable or not Rel reliable in terms of their ability to help you meet your interceptive needs and that period is puberty so up until now we've been talking mainly about psychology not a lot of biology not a lot of mechanism and now we're going to transition into talking about mechanism hormones receptors Etc puberty is a absolute biolog iCal event it has a beginning and it has a specific definition which is the transition into reproductive maturity so there are a lot of hormonal changes yes there are also a lot of brain changes and most people don't realize it but the brain changes occur first the brain turns on the hormone systems that allow puberty to occur one of the more interesting molecules that triggers puberty in all individuals is something called kisspeptin k i SS p p e p t i n kisspeptin kisspeptin is made by the brain and it stimulates large amounts of a different hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone to be released gonadotropin releasing hormone then causes the release of another hormone something like called luteinizing hormone or LH which travels in the bloodstream and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen and the testes of males to produce testosterone now this is interesting because at this point the testes in M start churning out tons of testosterone in order to trigger the development of secondary sexual characteristics body hair and all the others deepening of voice Etc and in female's estrogen is doing various other things breast development Etc so that's how puberty happens at the biological level gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin and then this young child is now a different creature to some to some extent not just because they're reproductively competent of course but because there's a shift in a number of the things that underly these social bonds there are there's a market shift in a number of the things that allow children and adults to engage in predictive Behavior about each other and most of what consumes the minds and waking hours of adolescence and children who have gone through puberty and going through puberty is questions about how they relate to social structures who they can rely on and how they can make reliable predictions in the world now that they have more agency that they are physically changed in fact you could argue that puberty is the fastest rate of maturation that you'll go through at any point in your life it's the largest change that you'll go through at any point in your life in terms of who you are because your biology has fundamentally changed at the level of your brain and your your bodily organs all your organs from the skin inward so I want to visit a little bit of the research about some of the core needs that occur during puberty and Adolescence so there's a terrific review article that was published in the journal Nature about the biology of adolescence and puberty as well as some of the core needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional maturation during that time we we will provide a link to that but I'm I just want to highlight a few of the things that they place in the final table I don't want to go through all the results right now because you could do that on your own if you like they mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons and neural circuits for instance I'll just highlight one there's a connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in emotion and dispersal dispersal is very interesting What You observe in animals and humans is that around the end of adolescence and during the transition to puberty both because of changes in the brain and changes in hormones there's an intense desire on the part of the child to get further and further away from primary caregivers mostly there's a desire to start spending more time with friends more time with peers and less time with adults so there's something about these hormones that don't just allow sexual reproduction they don't just change the brain and bodily organs in the shape of of us they also bias us towards dispersal getting further and further away from primary caregivers in particular and what's interesting is during puberty there's increased con connection connectivity as we call it between the prefrontal cortex which is involved in motivation and decision- making being able to suppress action for making long-term uh goals possible uh as well as dopamine centers and the amydala so there's this really broad integration and testing I think this is the key element here testing of circuits for emotions and reward as they relate to decisions and I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior of Adolescent and teens they are testing social interactions they are testing physical interactions with the world often times they're engaging in unsafe behavior and you can't um just I I would never try and justify that with with the underlying neurology but the Neuroscience points to increased connectivity between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality and uh to threat detection like the amydala but also reward so it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors lead to success or not it's how different behaviors lead to fear States or not you can start to map the neurology onto some of this emotion exploration I do realize that this episode is about emotions puberty is a time in which the internal state of the person or the animal is being sampled and tested against different extra receptive events only now they are able to guide those events with more agency the child or the Adolescent is now able the teen really is able to Now sample many many more extra receptive events through behavior and so ad Ence and puberty is really seen as the period of development in which one self- samples for these two elements that we talked about at the beginning which are how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good at a level of interoception but in terms of the biology it's clear that there's this stage of development where more autonomy more physical capability is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain and these peptide changes in the brain and body and that nonetheless brings us back to the exact same model that we started with an infancy of alert or calm feel good or feel bad primarily exter accepting primarily intercepting so I keep going back to this I'm sort of like a repeating record on that because the same core algorithm the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan and that's a useful framework in my opinion because it allows you to sort through through all the data and information that's out there about well this area the stat terminalis is active or the basolateral amydala is active or gry matter thickening or this hormone or that hormone and return to a kind of Kernel of certainly not exhaustive truth it doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality but at least establishes some groundwork from which you can start to evaluate how different behaviors might or might not make sense how certain emotional responses might or might not make sense regardless of the age of the person or the organism there's a theory of emotional development that I find particularly interesting which is from Allan Shore at UCLA that talks about how most of our testing of bonds and relationships is this seawing back and forth between very dopaminergic so driven by dopamine or serotonergic driven by serotonin States and this starts with infant and mother or infant and father healthy emotional development clearly begins with an ability for the caretaker and child to be in calm peaceful soothing touch oriented eye gazing type of behaviors those really Drive serotonin the endogenous opioid system uh oxytocin things that are very calming and are centered around pleasure with the here and now as well as excited states of what we're going to do next there's actually a a kind of characteristic sign of the dopaminergic interaction where both car AK and child have are wide-eyed the pupils dilate that's signature of arousal they get really excited often times the baby will look away if it gets really excited that those are signatures of dopamine release in the body and in adolescence these same things carry forward where their good bonds are achieved through hanging around watching TV just kind of being or you know playing video games or texting together or talking whatever it is that the the soothing local activity happens to be as well as Adventure and things that are exciting and so this kind of seawing back and forth between the different reward systems seems to be the basis from which healthy emotional bonds are created we can't have a complete conversation about emotions and bonds and social connection without talking about oxytocin oxytocin has come to such prominence in the last decade or so and seems to be everywhere anytime you hear a discussion about neuros signs in the brain or hormones in the brain oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females it is released in response to sexual interactions it is released in response to nonsexual touch it's released in males and females and indeed it's involved in pair bonding and the establishment of social bonds in general how it does that seems to be by matching internal state it seems to both increase synchrony of internal State somehow maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness that seems like a reasonable hypothesis as well as raising people's awareness for the emotional state of their partner and again this brings us back to this alertness calmness axis and this inter receptive extra receptive axis in order to form good bonds we can't just be thinking about how we feel we also need to be paying attention to how others feel and we're evaluating a match we're trying to see whether or not there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states and oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony and increase the awareness for the emotional state of others so here are some experiments that involve the administration of of intranasal oxytocin what's been reported is increase positive communic unication among couples that study just if you for those of you like was published in biological Psychiatry which my Psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal and the title is intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels during couple conflict they have them fight with and without oxytocin so interesting very much in line with the idea that oxytocin is the quote unquote trust hormone the other molecule that we make that's extremely important for social bonds in emotionality is one that we're going to talk about more in the month on hormones and that's vasopressin vasopressin has effects on the brain directly it actually creates feelings of giddy love it also has very interesting effects on monogamous or non- monogamous Behavior this again we will revisit in the future but there's a beautiful set of experiments that have been done in a little rodent species called a prairie V it turns out there are two different populations of prairie some are monogamous they always mate with the same other Prairie V and some are very robustly non- monogamous they mate with as many other Prairie vs as they can and turns out that levels of vasopressin Andor vasopressin receptor dictate whether or not they're monogamous or not there's actually some interesting evidence in humans when you when people report their behavior assuming they're reporting it accurately that vasopressin and vasopressin levels um can relate to monogamy or non- monogamy in humans as well we're going to talk about this in the month on hormones if we're talking about the Neuroscience of emotions we have to talk about the vagus nerve I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode that's these connections between the body and the viscera including the gut the heart the lungs and the immune system and the brain and that the brain is also controlling these organs so it's a two-way street there's this big myth out there that I mentioned before that stimulating the Vegas in various ways leads to calmness that it's always going to calm you down and that is is false now this is interesting in light of emotionality because of work that's been done by many groups but in particular I'm going to focus on the work of a colleague of mine Carl daero at Stanford who's a psychiatrist but has also developed a lot of tools to adjust the activity of neurons in real time using light and electrical stimulation and so forth I'll refer you to an article in the New Yorker that was published about this a few years ago I'm going to read a brief excerpt but I'll put the the link in the caption as well he's talking to an extremely depressed suicidally uh depressed patient who has a small device implanted that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity they're in his office and they're talking and he asks her how she's doing and she she describes how she's been doing as um previously as quote unquote going pancake which for her just means totally laid out flat not much going on she talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job but she's really depressed um and he says in you know typical good psychiatrist fashion you know well that's a lot to think about that's actually the quote um uh and they talk about her blood pressure Etc and then she says you know mood's been down just spiraling down talks about insomnia bad dreams low appetite so this is severe depression this is what we call major depression and then she requests can we please go up to 1.5 on Vegas stimulation she'd been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation every 5 minutes to 30 seconds but was no longer able to feel the effects so he says okay I think we can go up a little you're tolerating things well they start the stimulation and quote in the course of the next few minutes her name was Sally underwent a remarkable change her frown disappeared she became cheerful describing the pleasure she had had during the Christmas holiday and recounting how she'd recently watched some YouTube videos of D she was still smiling and talking when the session ended and they walked out to the reception area so this is just by stimulating and activating the Vegas now why am I bringing this up well for several reasons one is the Vegas is fascinating in terms of the brain Body Connection two I'd like to uh keep trying to dispel the myth that Vegas stimulation is all about being calm it's really about being alert I don't know how that originally got going backwards but it's about being alert and once again level of alertness or level of calmness is impacting emotion that this access of alertness and calmness is one primary axis in Emotion it's not the only one because there's also this veilance component of good or bad and it's those two aren't the only ones because there's also this component of inter receptive exter receptive that we talked about earlier and there will be others too again it's not exhaustive but I find it fascinating and it really brings us back to where we started which is what are the core elements of emotion and what can you do about them this business of how you conceptualize emotions is really the most powerful tool you can ever have in terms of understanding and regulating your emotional state if you're willing to try and wrap your head around it I realize it's not the simplest thing to do but rather than think of emotions as just these labels happy sad awe depressed thinking them thinking about emotions excuse me as elements of the brain embody that Encompass levels of alertness that include a dynamic with the outside world and your perception of your internal State and starting to really think about emotions in a structured way can not only allow you to understand some of the pathology of when you know you might feel depressed or anxious or others are depressed and anxious but also to develop a richer emotional experience to anything so I offer it to you as a as a source of knowledge from which you can start to think about your emotional life differently I hope as well as others in a way that builds more richness into that experience not that detracts from it I want to thank you for your time and attention and thank you for your interest in science [Music]

Title: Using Your Mind to Control Your Physical Health & Longevity | Dr. Ellen Langer
Published: 2025-02-03 13:00:38 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Ellen Langer, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Harvard University and the world’s leading researcher on the mind-body connection and the power our thinking has on our physical health. She explains how specific ways of framing and asking questions about the world shape our physical health and rate of aging. Dr. Langer also explains how our perception of time and control significantly impact our rate of physical healing, hormones, immune system, and longevity. She describes mindfulness as a way of framing life, not simply a meditation or other practice, and discusses data showing how to use one’s mind to overcome health challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes. Dr. Langer is a luminary and pioneer in researching the relationship between the mind and body with scientific rigor. Her work and our discussion are applicable to women and men of all ages and walks of life.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Ellen Langer Dr Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard University and one of the world's leading Pioneers in the Mind Body Connection more specifically how our thoughts impact our health Dr Ellen Langer was one of the first people to systematically explore the mindbody connection with scientific rigor her laboratory has made a large number of truly fascinating findings for instance today you'll learn about a study that Dr Langer did in which she brought quite old people into her laboratory or rather she designed a laboratory such that people lived in this laboratory but the laboratory itself was designed to resemble the environment everything from the types of furniture the types of dishes the types of music Etc that those those people had lived in 20 years prior when those subjects lived in that laboratory for less than one week the change in the environment and their interaction with that environment LED them to have far more Mobility better cognitive function and a large number of other markers of biological aging reversed which is absolutely remarkable and speaks to the incredible power that the mind has over our biology that's just one example of the sorts of experiments that Dr Langer has done again with a tremendous amount of scientific rigor so today Dr Langer and I talk about how the acquisition of knowledge just simply learning about certain biological mechanisms as well as your mindset about various aspects of your health and well-being can powerfully dictate your health and well-being we talk about longevity we talk about exercise and weight loss we talk about infectious disease in fact we also talk about how mindset can impact cancer outcomes or rather overcoming cancer we discuss examples mechanisms and practical application of those mechanisms by the end of today's episode I assure you that Dr Ellen Langer will change the way that you think about the mindbody connection the way you think about your health and I assure you it's not all just about positive thinking in fact Dr Ellen Langer gets us to think differently about scientific questions our health and just about everything else in the world you'll soon see she has a quite unique way of thinking not just about science and health but also about life in general and what makes for a truly good life Dr Ellen Langer is a true luminary and Pioneer in this area of Mind Body health and she's a fabulous teacher as well before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme this episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with Dr Ellen Langer Dr Ellen Langer welcome thank you Andrew so great to have you here there's so many topics that you've worked on and shed light on that impact our daily lives and our internal world and our external world and how they interact I want to know your definition of mindfulness and it could take on practical forms theoretical forms and make it very simple that when most people hear the word mindful sadly they think of meditation meditation is great but it's not mindful you meditate in order to result in postm meditative mindfulness okay uh so it's a practice mindfulness as I study it is a way of being it's not a practice it's the simple process of noticing now you can get there in one of two ways bottom up actively notice three new things about the person you live with walk outside notice three new things each time you do this you see that you didn't know the thing you thought you knew as well as you thought you knew it you can also do it top down um top down is recognize that everything is always changing everything looks different from different perspectives uncertainty is the rule it's not the exception so when you know you don't know then you naturally tune in so one of the things I've said this so many times maybe this will be the L Les um one of the things we think we know best is how much is one plus one Andrew I'm going to assume it's still two two not always if you add one watt of chewing gum to one wat of chewing gum 1 plus 1 is one you add one Cloud to One Cloud 1 plus 1 is one um you this is interesting somebody sent this to me the other day you take one pizza and you add one pizza one plus one is two you take one lasagna and you add one lasagna 1 plus one is one it's just a bigger lasagna right you take one puddle and you add yeah let's say I have two puddles there and you add some more order in between now you have 1 + 1 + 1 is 1 okay so the point of it is that in the real world 1+ one probably doesn't equal two as a more oftenness it does and since you're an educated individual you might know that 1 + 1 equals 2 if you're using a base 10 number system if you're using a base two number system 1 plus 1 is written as 10 oh my goodness somebody asks you how much is 1+ one should you say one two 10 um and um the point is that when you know you don't know then you pay attention in this context let me see I'll be a smartass and I'll say one um or in this context I know the person wants me to be obedient and I'll say to so on and so forth so when you don't know you pay attention when you pay attention you have choices that otherwise you're blind to it makes a very big difference so in your mind ful you don't know you actively notice as you're noticing the neurons are firing and 50 years of research has shown that it's literally and figuratively enlightening and if you're going to do something show up for it now the problem is that most people are Mindless almost all the time and they're totally oblivious to it when you're not there you're not there to know you're not there and most people are just not there now you want to ask me how does that happen well we taught that schools I think are the biggest culprits schools are teaching us absolute answers 1 plus one is two virtually everything that we're taught is as if the world is constant and going to stay that way and the answer today is going to be the same answer as tomorrow um and so that certainty leads us not to notice how did you come to realize this thing that we call mindfulness I mean it certainly in the last 20 years the notion of meditation as a valuable practice has has become pretty common common sure um and prior to that it was considered a little bit uh alternative hippy let me answer okay so it's very funny I I'm glad in some ways I don't remember who this person was but I started studying mindlessness and and I found myself I'd walk into a mannequin I'd apologize you know all sorts of things like that and I well this is kind of interesting to me I'm speaking to somebody we don't know who it was anymore who said to me you know you are what you study I said okay so then I switched it around from being mindless to being mindful at that point then I found out about um me know meditation and Buddhism and all of this and started to learn about um another way of being what was exciting to me was that I had gotten through this Western Scientific mode so to speak to the same um many of the same consequences as the Buddhists had talked about for thousands of years it's interesting how um now in Western Society we Embrace this idea of presence but it gets merged with these um kind of more rigid terms like focus and attention yeah now focus is actually mindless you know um so it's interesting um focus on your finger now if you're concent training focusing what you're going to notice is that your fingers the image is moving around right and so when we try to hold something still that's the wrong thing you shouldn't tell people to focus now instead of focus look at your finger mind mindfully that means you're going to notice new things are that's an ugly little finger and what is that line there and why is this red and when you're doing that when you're actively noticing uh the image stays still so when we give people instructions in school you focus they think as a camera hold it still and whenever we're trying to hold ourselves the image anything still we're going to be performing suboptimally we need to let things vary things are always changing so what happens is we confuse the stability of our mindsets we're holding something still on our heads with the stability of the underlying phenomena so mindfulness as a as a practice exploration presence and exploration is perhaps sure a slightly better perhaps way to think about it it's not a practice you see once you accept that um everything is uncertain then you just tune in you'd only don't tune in when you think you know so if you were going to come visit me in um uh Cambridge you've never been to my house you don't have to practice anything you walk in you'll notice things just did she do that pain what is that you know oh look what she's reading there's two dogs you just exactly exactly you'll you'll notice um without having to do any work and that's the important thing because in the way I keep differentiating mindfulness as I study it with meditation meditation is a practice for some people to sit still 20 minutes twice a day is work mindfulness as I study it is what you're doing when you're having fun you can't have fun unless you're actively noticing right so in fact this act of noticing is energy begetting not consuming so it feels good it's the essence of when you're doing when you're having the most fun it's good for you and it's so easy that you know I can't see any reason why anybody wouldn't embrace it um you know that um it's good for you when you're mindful people find you more appealing charismatic when you're mindful the products you produce enhanced um and it's healthier I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online now I personally have been doing therapy weekly for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to one's overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise which of course also do every week they're essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about pretty much any issue with second of all it can provide support in the form of emotional support and directed guidance and third expert therapy can provide useful insights insights that allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself and your professional life and to all sorts of goals better help makes it very easy to find an expert therapist with with whom you resonate with and that can provide you those three benefits that come from

physical health and performance now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in terms of the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft it is How firm it is how breathable it is the temperature all play into your comfort and needs to be tailored to your unique sleep needs if you go to the Helix website you'll take a brief two-minute quiz and it will ask you questions such as do

the answers to those questions maybe you don't but either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress D I started sleeping on the dusk mattress about 3 and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had it's absolutely clear to me that having a mattress that's right for you does improve one's sleep if

giving up to 25% off all mattress orders again that's Helix sleep.com huberman to get up to 25% off I think for a lot of people a practice of meditation uh feels like the best or most um you know uh obvious Gateway into this thing that we're calling mindfulness it's one way and I'm not demeaning I did some research you know in the 80s on medic meditation it's wonderful just it's just different and they're not mutually exclusive you can do both and part of the advantage of um meditating possibly has nothing to do with the meditation you know why are you going to meditate you so you want to be a Kinder nicer person you could just be kinder or nicer but now you're going to go to this trouble 20 minutes twice a day you're going to you sit up and take notice and be a Kinder nicer person so maybe it's the time investment as opposed to something um specific about the meditation practice that's a heretical idea in the in the world of well uh Wellness um but of course but but they're not mutually exclusive you know so I'm not denying uh some of the more inherent properties let's say but there's this this other piece to it I love the way that you look at things that we take for granted as operating one way through this different perspective um our mutual friend Ali crumb told me the story that at one point she was in it conversation with you and you said well maybe exercise and all its effects on our health is just an epip phenomenon I could you talk a little bit more about that I think first of all I don't think most people are familiar with what epip phenomena are but this idea of looking at things through a different portal seems so valuable regardless of what the experimental outcome turned out to be and perhaps we should touch on that experimental outcome about uh labor versus um non- labor there's so much there you I don't know where to where go we want to talk about that the research let's talk about the study well before we go to the study though let's go to the reason for the study way back when all right so um there's so many paths I can take here take them all okay we'll start with one so I did some research uh back in the 70s with u people in nursing homes and why did I do that because um I had somebody in the family who was in a nursing home it was very distressing to see people people just sitting there doing nothing and barely existing and so we had the idea that if we gave people choices that might get them more engaged in their in their living and so we did that we gave people um uh encouragement to decide where to see people whether to visit them in your room in the lounge you have to remember you can't go into an establishment and business and turn the whole power structure around but so Within reason we came up with choices people could make we gave them an opportunity to see a movie you could see it on Tuesday or Thursday we gave them a plant to take care of all right the comparison group The Tender Loving Care Group uh we told them you know people will be visiting you and we'll uh set it up so you can uh you'll be visiting in the loung everything was controlled that way you can see a movie um and we'll let you know if you're going to see it on Tuesday or Thursday here's a plant and the nurses will care for it uh for you all right so um we do this we come back um I think it was three weeks I don't remember it's been so long uh 18 months later first we took initial measures come back 18 months later those people who were um given this these choices live longer and that was the beginning of um all of my work on Health in some sense how could it be that making choices results in a longer life all right so what is there about choic making and then the choices were Mickey Mouse choices you know um you can you always have Choice available too you can turn on a light switch you can do it with your right hand your right hand your left hand one finger three fingers lift your foot like so many choices that you can bring to a table if Choice making is good for you why don't people do this and that got me more into uh the mindlessness and mindfulness work now okay so we have people living longer how can it be that you're making choices your mind is active and your body complies and so then I thought about it uh not in one F swoop um but realized that this whole notion of mind body these are just words we come together here I am all of me my fingers my shoulders my thoughts as one thing and if we put the mind and body back together then the amount of control we have is enormous right wherever I put my mind I'm also putting my body so in the mindful body which started off as a memoir I have lots of stories that show the leading up to this idea let me just tell you two very quickly one was I got married Andrew you won't believe it I was obscenely young and you find out if you read the book I was even younger than admitted because I was secretly married years before that okay so I go I'm 19 years old I think I go to Paris on my honeymoon we go into this restaurant I order a mixed grill one of the foods there was a pancreas my then husband who was more sophisticated than I more worldly I said which of these is the pancreas says that so I eat everything I'm a big eater now comes the Moment of Truth can I eat the pancreas why I thought that being married meant I had to eat the pancreas I I still haven't figured out but anyway I start eating it and he starts laughing not good for newly woods and I ask him why are you laughing he said cuz that's chicken you ate the pancreas a long time ago so I made myself sick okay the other side of that my mother had uh breast cancer that had metastasized to her pancreas and um then magically it was gone somehow she had made herself well so I had many of these sorts of experiences and talk about you know mine I've been talking about this since gosh uh when did we first since 79 so now people are talking about Mind Body Connection it's not a connection you know if you're talking about a connection between two things it says they're separate and you still have to deal with what's connecting them when you put them back together it's one thing you don't have to deal with with um you know that mediator and so um the study you're asking me about which I'm surprised I'm having a junior moment that I actually remembered the question you asked rather than a senior moment um that uh before I tell you about the study with with valy the first study we did testing this Mind Body Unity was a counterclockwise study so here what we did was we took elderly men we were going to have them live in a retreat that had been retrofitted to 20 years earlier and had them live there as if they were their younger selves so they talked about things from the past as if they were just unfolding the results were incredible their Vision improved their hearing improved their memory their strength and they look noticeably younger so that was very exciting and began all this mindbody Unity work now comes the study that you're talking about with Ally where um in a conversation that she and I had she was my student um and she made proclamations about exercise and any Proclamation this is the short answer to your question anybody proclaims anything my mind immediately goes so when might not that be true I'm starting to pick up on that yeah you know a it's a gimmick I guess it's a gift is what it is um and um so um the question was that how important was the understanding of exercise to the effects of exercise so we take tramber maids and interestingly the first question we asked is how much exercise do you get and they say they don't get very much exercise because to them exercise is what you do after work that's with the Surgeon General who sits behind kind of desk old days um so you would imagine whether they realized they were getting exercise or not since they're getting so much exercise that they're going to be healthier than other people who are not getting them and they weren't that's interesting so now we divide them into two groups very simple study um randomly divide them into two groups and one group we simply teach them their work as exercise making a bed is like working in this machine at the gym doing the windows whatever so you have two groups one who thinks they work as exercise one who doesn't realize um we take many many measures um and they're not eating any differently one group from the other they're not working any harder nevertheless the group that changed their mind and now saw their work as exercise lost weight there was a change in waist to hip ratio body mass index and their blood pressure came down remarkable yeah yeah and what what usually talk about um when I start talking about this is that this was a test of the no sio effect most people know what the plus ebo is you take something that's nothing and it has the effect as if it's something right you take a sugar pill thinking it's strong medication and um it plays out as if it was a nobo is the reverse you're taking something so here you're doing the exercise but you don't realize it and it uh gets rid of the effect an early study on this was don't remember who did it now was a senior moment um people were given epicac and epicac is supposed to make you vomit so if you accidentally had poison or whatever you take epicac and bomit so people are given epicac people who have a problem vomiting and they're told the epicac will stop their vomiting and it stops their vomiting uh so many Placebo studies where you take people they're rubb with a a leaf that they think is poisonous Ivy so it is either is poison ivy or it's not poison ivy you think it's poison ivy or you don't think it's Poison Ivy and your body reacts to your thoughts if you think it's not poison ivy you don't get the rash if you think it is poison ivy you do spectacular yeah and so you know we've been studying this for forever I think that placebos are probably our very strongest medicine although um it's interesting that um when people think that they were given a placebo they get very upset you know they should be excited um because if the placebo didn't cure you who cured you you did it yourself but placebos have gotten a bad rap uh I think primarily because of the pharmaceutical companies right you want to bring a drug to market the way you do that is you have to run um an experiment where the drug outperforms the Placebo and when it doesn't damn it I can't make all those billions of dollars without saying wow this sugar pill is mighty mighty strong I want to talk about three themes that you raised the first one is this Mind Body notion and now as even as I say it Mind Body I I feel like a hint of guilt because I completely agree that the division of mind and body is one of the greatest mistakes of thinking psychology and Western medicine that ever existed in fact a lot of my uh you know secret mission in this podcast is to remind people every single episode it seems that you know the brain and body are connected bidirectionally through the nervous system but other systems too like there's no there's no single system hormone system nervous system immune system that doesn't that doesn't you know cross the blood rain barrier and go back and forth that's all because of dayart you know dayart was out to dinner and the uh waitress asked him if he wanted a salad and he said I think not and he disappeared I think I am I was about to ask like how how was it and after that Andrew I say this is not my day job so I don't have to be funny I love it I love it um I've spent a lot of time um trying to learn the history of medicine and and the the merge of philosophy and Medicine there's a wonderful book that if anyone is suffering from insomnia they should check out because it's extremely detailed and difficult to listen to or read but it's called The Prince of medicine which basically details all the reasons why we are so confused about how medicine is done and should be done and it has to do with rules and restrictions and cultural conventions and it's it's a whole barbed wire mess basically but um it includes this mess that was created for us which is this idea that somehow because the brain is perhaps the seat of our Consciousness to many people they believe that um but certainly you know like if I if I were to lose a few fingers on my left hand I'm not sure I would fundamentally be a different person but if I lost a few millimeter or the equivalent amount of of real estate in my brain my personality could very well change perhaps for the better um some some would say uh and I'm probably now hoping for that event um but all kidding aside you know I think the mindbody distinction is is has really poisoned our thinking about what's possible and the other experiments that you you described you know point to what's possible and I I want to talk about those but maybe if we could just hover on this notion of the of mind and body as as a single thing that there's an us I don't want to get too philosophical here but that that there's an us and and our body carries us forward in in motor Behavior but but like how should we conceptualize the self if we don't have a mindbody distinction I don't know why why that's a problem well I think why you know I am who I am period right how does that change whether we want to see me as having a mind body and elbows um so explain to me and then I will explain to you yeah well what I love is um I'm going to first uh reflect uh what I love is the the flexibility of your thinking around these things again it's like maybe exercise the effects of exercise are epip phenomena or um you know so in thinking about Mind Body I I can't get my no pun intended my head around this distinction that if I lose a certain piece of my body I'm not fun Mally changed if I but if I lose a piece of neural real estate I'm fundamentally different that's the only thing that anchors me to the to the idea that they're separate that true I mean if you know let's say you're an athlete and you lose two of your fingers you're not going to be performing in the same way that you performed in the past and surely you'd end up different yeah yeah that's I'll I'll buy that explanation yeah I mean I'm just I'm just trying to probe this because I think um nowadays people think oh you know if I breathe in a certain way I'll change my state of mind which is true um if I think differently get stressed or relaxed I'll change the way that I breathe I mean I think that we're starting to understand the bidirectionality of these things I think some of the um even the work with the brain where um to assess this Neuroscience now is crazy with uh fmis and we want no matter what happens you want to see what's going on in the brain and I think that implicitly in a backwards way that leads people away from realizing that whatever you're looking for is probably manifested every place you know I I had this experience um I I like doing strange things and I was out in Kansas City and so somebody said there's an iridologist what is an irid sure for fun we'll go to the iridologist so this person is looking in my eye my Iris that's the iridologist part and she said uh you have a problem with your gallbladder I thought okay that's great gu we leave and have my time I go back home and I had a problem with my gallbladder really everything is everywhere the problem is we don't have the technology to notice it you know so when you're happy your skin is different from when you're not happy but who can see such small distinctions but it's there all we do is look to see where the brain is different it's all one anything I believe anything that's happening on any level is simultaneously simultaneously not sequentially more or less happening on every level so a teardrop of sadness biochemically is different from a teardrop of uh joy and so it's all there we just have to notice I have no memory now of what it was used said that led to that on my part but I'm glad I said it anyway well we're probing mind body and and their interconnectedness and um so this iridologist I've never heard that term before um this iridologist it could be based on what we were discussing a few moments ago it could be that the suggestion that there was a problem with your gallbladder led to a problem with your gallbladder or do you you think that that she had some or or he had some um diagnostic knowledge um I hadn't even considered the former which is strange to me um no I just assumed that she was seeing something and um you know but your idea but either way it's fascinating right some you know by somebody suggesting you have a gallbladder problem to have a gold BR problem um yeah what are your thoughts on things like acupuncture and and like and when I think about acupuncture I'm not just thinking about the needles the few times I've been to an acupuncturist um the first thing they do is they ask you to stick out your tongue they they are able to diagnose um tongue texture and color and maybe they I think everything is everywhere although there's you know I I teach health psych in at Harvard and there's some data on it being mostly Placebo but you know and that sounds like a downer but most of everything is Placebo what does that mean that virtually everything is controlled by our thoughts and we need to embrace that um to make the changes that most of us deserve desire so in other words so going to an acupuncturist itself means I want to to find answers and seek and you are more likely to find and um and then you're in a position to improve might I ask what happened with your mom's mindset that or life or psychological life that you think led to the there's you know it's a an N of one you know uh it's very hard to know I knew that when she got sick uh I believed at that point that um being anything negative was going to um work in the opposite direction and so and I wouldn't let anybody into see her who wasn't uplifting um you know that was I don't there's no way of knowing if any of that mattered or not I went and got her a very expensive set of golf clubs um she wasn't a big golfer but you know my reasoning was that you know I must believe she's going to be better or why would I have spent the money uh her reasoning was my reasoning must be that if I get these she'll think that you know so it didn't work but we had these golf clubs that were never used um you know I don't know um I I believe that um we have more control uh at that point I hadn't done all of these experiments um that might have led me to push even harder it was kind of funny though because the way I had cognized everything back then was the importance of perceived control and I had these data people living longer and so on and yet mindlessly I you know virtually took over her life you know deciding who can see or what she can do um but um I don't know um and I don't think there would have been with just one person any way of knowing what what led to the uh disease going away but the fact that it went away was crucial to me you know I think that um we we have to talk about the myths in medicine that what people need to understand is that all science are probabilities an experiment doesn't give you absolute facts and we teach these probabilities as if they're absolute and um give up a great deal of control by doing so now U you asked me before um about how I came to certain things let me go back uh to an answer I should have given you many years ago I was um at a horse event and this man asked me would I watch his horse for him because he wants to get his horse a hot dog hot dog I'm a straight A student what is it crazy horses don't eat meat sure I'll watch your horse he comes back with the hot dog and the horse ate it and that's when I realized everything I thought I knew could be wrong and I thought what does it mean horses don't eat meat how many horses were tested and what were they tested with how much meat mixed with how much grain and what kind of grain and how big are these horses and when was the last you know and so on and it all opened up and I said how could we make such a statement horses don't eat meat but when you think about science then imagine if you did the experiment and you're trying to teach somebody what you found you say these particular horses who hadn't eaten for 3 days were given this grain and under those circumstances 80% of them didn't eat meat that's a mouthful right you can't you know communicate that way so you abbreviate it horses don't eat meat so it's not in the telling that's the problem it's in the receiving of the information we have to know that these things are you know are just not true to the one but it's very important because every time you're given a diagnosis you take the diagnosis as real well it's not the case that they can be sure that all of these symptoms mean you have this disease and if you have quote this disease we don't know that all of the people who have it are going to follow and and it becomes very unlikely when you when you turn it all inside out that way and so um another part of this that we can get into or not is people's understanding probabilities in general and that you can't predict now people ask for answers all the time you know even the how much is one in one um you know uh should I have the surgery what is the disease that I have and by recognizing that all information that's given is for the group not for the individual um a few examples of this that's kind of funny I say so um Michael Jordan and I are going to have a foul shooting contests we each get to shoot one basket who's going to win well most people are just going to quickly say Michael Jordan all right how much money you willing to bet on this one shot each million dollars I'll give you a million dollars if Ellen Langer wins you give me um or I'll give you a million dollars of Michael Jord wins you give me half a million dollars if Ellen Langer wins first you think you'll take the beted but when you think about it no he sometimes misses she sometimes makes the basket um maybe had a fight with his wife didn't sleep well you know maybe she is in top form and this is now the moment she's going to make that basket or make it simple he said to himself let the older woman win why not really you know and when you think of all the reasons why could be the case that I could win all of a sudden you become less certain now certainly if we were shooting a 100 baskets he would win let give you another example I use too often because I don't know which of these will will feel right you go and um to a Mercedes parking lot or pick your favorite car and I'm going say there are 100 cars there you choose one and if it starts I will give you a million dollars if it doesn't start you give me your full life savings assuming it's under a million capped at a million okay now Mercedes are wonderful cars nobody is going to take that bet everybody knows you know sometimes it doesn't work you know sometimes the genius gets something wrong sometimes the car is a lemon and so on so what we mean when we say you if you were going to start at a 100 cars most of them are going to start but you can't predict which one isn't going to well in life I'm happy if an operation is good for most people I want to know is it going to work for me and there's no way to know that you can never predict the individual case but Andrew we don't have to worry about that because you can always predict or control your reaction to whatever is happening so it doesn't matter as much you see if I can be happy whether this occurs or the opposite occurs um I care less about which way it turns out but right now we're all brought up in a world we had these good things we have these bad things you've got to kill yourself to get the good things step over whoever you can to avoid the bad things once you recognize that's all in your head and just be still my favorite example this is so for me was so funny I'm doing uh one of these podcasts over zoom and I'm trying to explain that um uh evaluation is in your head not in the things you're evaluating I say as an example so if the internet went out right now wouldn't be terrible I'd go have lunch the internet went out just at that moment and I did have lunch because I had put the suggestion in my mind you know most things don't matter we don't recognize that and I think I I have a few one liners that if people understand or care about nothing else that I've said take this to heart that next time you're stressed ask yourself is it a tragedy or an inconvenience it's almost never a tragedy and so then you breathe you know so I um failed the test I got you know dented the car I missed the bus whatever it is so what um and so you know you take a deep breath and come back to yourself and realize that most of the things that make us crazed are um unnecessary you get a lot of this as you get older but I teach my students this early on why wait you know why wait to recognize that you're the one who's your almost always your worst enemy I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor

emphasized on this podcast it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light sources have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing improvements in acne reduced pain and inflammation even mitochondrial function and improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the ju whole body panel about three to four times a week and I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try juv you can go to juv spelled jv.com huberman juv is offering an exclusive discount to all hubman lab listeners with up to $400 off ju products again that's ju spell jv.com huberman to get up to $400 off so much of our developmental wiring is based on learning how to predict what's going to happen next I mean you think about object constancy that kids you know of a certain age you put a ball behind your back they think it disappeared eventually they realize just because you moved your arm and the ball behind your back doesn't mean that the ball is gone this kind of thing um sad sadly though um then they believe the ball is still there when in fact the bow may be gone true right okay so there's always a portal portal to a different to a different outcome it's I'm and I'm catching on to your mode of thinking here this is actually what I'm trying to trying to do because I think um you know the brain is a prediction making machine in addition to doing other things that regulates heartbeat all the autonomic stuff right heartbeat digestion Etc it remembers things and it's a prediction making machine uh at least those three things I feel like the prediction making aspect of our neural circuitry is what leads us to this notion of having control or wanting control because I think a lot of what's H happening in our conversation in the backdrop of these experiments is uh to what extent do we have control over outcomes well it's interesting because our mindlessness which results I think in part to hold on to things to have control is the very thing that deprives us of control so again things are changing you're holding it still in your mind um and you know so um you're living with somebody or you meet somebody and you you know right away you decide what you know size that person up so now you can control your interactions with them um and and but what you're doing is ignoring all the times the person is not like that um and uh all the ways that the relationship uh could have otherwise grown you know that we in general and this is you know I have um a psychological treatment for chronic illness it's all based on the same idea of change things are changing we're always holding it still and um so you have the illusion that you're controlling things you know but it um in fact uh you're giving up control by not recognizing for yourself or somebody else you know all of our statements of we can't do or we can do you can't know whether you can or you can't the fact that you did it doesn't mean that you can do it again the fact that you couldn't do it doesn't mean you couldn't do it in the future I feel like close to the end of each year which we just you know passed recently um these lists come out oh these resolutions are so mindless and but they're more than just Mindless um they deny that what we did made sense or else we wouldn't have done it that one thing that I told you is more important to me than anything else that I came to over all these years of study um you know so you're going to resolve that you're going to I don't know stop drinking you're going to go to the gym whatever these New Year's resolutions are suggests that what you were doing instead of that thing you think you should be doing was not something you should have been doing and um and I think that's never the case I woke up early this morning and and the my first thoughts of the day I like to think have some importance for something who knows it's when my mind it seems clearest for at least a nanc um and my first thought was that the pattern that I seem to be perpetually in is one of whatever I'm doing unless I'm podcasting or reading a research paper that my mind is constantly flitting to the other things that I think I should be doing yeah that's sad it's very it's sad and and it's something I've been working on for a very long time and I'm able to hold my for lack of a better word attention on things to accomplish tasks and you know in my life and to be present with people as it were but um I I thought well no let's let's go back to step because we both said it was sad why is it sad reconsidering you know that to um to be able to think of five different things instead of one Dre could be could be an asset right it could be an asset I think that for me what I I realize is um most of the shoulds are just total lies yeah they don't and also they don't they're just lies like they're not actually coming from a SC I'm not hearing other people's voices in my head uh you you should do this it's you know not parental narrative or or anything it's just it's just um it's just contamination of a of a like of a useless type it's not like listening to the radio I used to listen to the radio while I'd like make dinner or something and it was so pleasant right you know he hear an evening discussion about the news or talk talk show or whatever on the radio um while cooking and so that kind of quote unquote distraction felt really meaningful I felt like when I lived alone that I had other people in the room with me this is different this is it feels as if it detracts from some um essence of the behavior that I'm in even if the behavior is just getting out of bed in the morning wait so let me be clear you get out of bed or start to get out of bed and you have several thoughts yep and those thoughts bother you um or they prevent you from getting out of bed no but they feel intrusive they don't feel welcome like because I know what I'm going to do each day I have a policy for myself of doing one work thing each day maybe in one or two blocks and I try and really put everything I have into those it's kind of a recent evolution of not trying to do three things in a day um maybe it's a function of getting older but I I get so much more satisfaction and get truly so much more done from just doing one thing in my work life understand the the one thing idea you know that um people talk about multitasking which is what you're saying and you're better not to multitask but you're always multitasking right I mean I'm moving my hands while I'm talking to you and I'm sort of thinking and um you know fixing my back in the seat always lots of things going on um and I I think that also tasks you know so let's say you're kid and you're doing your social studies homework and then you're doing your math homework and so and you go back and forth so are you multitasking it depends if you see yourself as multitasking then you're drawing boundaries between your math and your social studies if you see yourself as doing homework it's all part of the same thing and so there's always a way that the task can be grouped as a single unit or you can see anything as multitasking when you see it as multitasking you're suggesting to yourself that there's going to be some conflict there's some reason I'm leaving this to go to this well maybe I'm I'm running the script backwards it let me put it different certainly the the level of satisfaction that I feel from having say worked on a chapter of my book for a couple of hours or even 45 minutes or from going for a run without my phone and just enjoying the run it it still blows me away how much I enjoy things that would that would fall under the category of simple things or things that that I experien in I ation yeah um as compared to how little I enjoy and sometimes um reflect on how punishing quote unquote multitasking is like like being in a text conversation while I'm walking on the beach no no but when you're texting while you're on the beach probably it's some kind of work text right there there's some something about it and why are you doing it when you're on the beach it's not because I can easily imagine oh I'm on the beach it's wonderful let me text Andrew and say Andrew you're right this time on the beach is wonderful and texting wouldn't take away from it you know I I my life is much simpler to me all you have are moments that's it and if you make the moment matter then the moment matters and you can't make it matter more it matters or it doesn't matter and so the question you know when you're lost doing or found really I don't want to say lost when we're writing I find myself while I'm writing but when you're you know engaged in an activity um you know you're making each of those moments matter but um you know they should matter as much I had this thought that I would help people who was stressed and I would say to them okay so assuming that their vision is reasonable I would just thread a needle threading the needle and then I'd ask them how they felt and everybody going to feel fine because you're actively engaged in doing something you're not engaged in what people call monkey brain or whatever worrying about tomorrow worrying about you know so on so to to go back to the your three your three things um you know uh it's like the text on the beach is not an I love you text because I don't see why that would distract you I could imagine being anywhere doing multiple things where I'm sharing what I'm doing but I'm not seeing them you know oh I have to do this work thing um and then the question is why see the work thing that way and especially someone like you where you don't need any of this anymore anyway you know well yeah that's that's a discussion into itself no but no it but it's important you know and so that if it's all fun it doesn't matter you know I was on this panel in Australia well first each of us gave a talk some Big Shots and then unbeknown to us they brought us all out and so we're sitting there and um I'm the last one to be asked and the question was what's on your bucket list and so the first person answers what's on the next person and we get five now it's my turn so I've had some time to think about this and you know my first thought I don't have a bucket list but of course you know that I'm going to say well it's good not to have a bucket list or else I'd have a bucket list so then I'm able to say why I don't have a bucket list you know if you imagine you're you're like a a glass you know and and the water is full or whatever you vodka in this case you know that it's full it's full you can't do more than that and so if the moment is Meaningful you don't have to be writing that book being in love um on a vacation in Paris um you know and so the I think we have all these crazy Notions um even the idea of I've talked about this before work life balance Oho that's scary to me what that says you know what life really means is some you know Joy right other than just being you know doing work 247 or however long people work not 247 um what is it 3 and a half anyway um that it suggests that we the work that we're doing has to be aversive and because it's aversive the only way to have the good life is to add this fun time and I think that's sad I think it's sad that people think life has to be stressful that work has to be unpleasant um you know that no matter what you're doing I believe there's a way of doing it so that it's fun well I love that notion I mean I will routinely F these these articles just get served up to me in my in my Google feed or something like the five things that people regret most on their deathbed I think these lists are terrible I do too I think they're terrible because without fail the number one two or three is always I wish I hadn't worked as much I've derived tremendous pleasure from my work but also tremendous relationships tremendous tremendous excuse me levels of insight into what I think are insights anyway clear you wouldn't be having the experience now yeah exactly exactly I mean I I'm constantly in Pinch Me moments with the podcast that was also true when I was running my lab and then I decided to transition more to this and other things but I mean this notion that one wishes they'd worked less it's such a it's such a sad thing to even think about but it also implies that you know somebody who enjoys their work doesn't enjoy their family or their relationships and that certainly isn't true either so there are all these assumptions that are written into these lists I'm actually quite opposed to um lists of that sort in a short media article form because I think a it clearly doesn't change Behavior I mean people have been talking about you know drink L well smoking was eradicated mostly from from this country through different mechanisms but um you know sleep sleep more um stress less I mean these lists come out and they they don't change Behavior at all and not only that but even the discussion about let's say something like sleep and I find it outrageous um I we might even disagree on this here but uh when people say how much sleep do you need now to me if I just ran a marathon I that night I probably need a different amount of sleep than if I stayed in bed eating candy watching movies all day yeah you know um and um my age everything should um play a part in this if I relax in the 2 or 3 hours before going to sleep that's it especially if I dim the lights I actually require a full two to three hours less of sleep to wake up feeling refreshed my criteria is what what does it take to wake up feeling reasonably refreshed so to go back to the Mind Body Unity studies we have a study where we have people in a sleep lab they wake up and the clock tells them they got two hours more sleep than they actually got two hours fewer or the amount of sleep they got biological and cognitive functioning uh follow perceived amount of sleep yeah this is such an important study I was going to bring it up later but I'm so glad you brought it up now these days a tremendous number of people are tracking their sleep I do it through my you know my eight Sleep mattress cover I love getting my sleep score I like to see what I got um people do with the with the uh Aura ring or the woop band or you know pick your favorite technology nowadays or Apple watch whatever if I understand this study correctly the perception of how much sleep people got based on their knowledge of a number a score Etc dictates the cognitive performance and their physical well-being I mean this is this runs countercurrent to like everything in the wellness biohacking movement it jibes however with the data that I'm aware of I think it was sleep lab at Stanford that um for instance positive anticipation of next day events reduces your sleep need and improves the quality your sleep just being excited for the next day can make it such that the 5 hours you got is sufficient the funniest thing is that if you have to wake up early in the morning to make a flight okay so you have to get up at 4:30 in the morning to make a flight what most people will do is go to sleep early the night before so they can wake up early but they're not going to be able to fall asleep because the amount of sleep they need is dictated by the day before not the day to come well I do think that um there was a I'll sleep when I'm dead mindset that was diminishing People's Health for a while I do think um it's great that books like Matt Walkers you know why we sleep Etc came out although that book focused more on the the bad things that happen if you don't sleep enough and I think Matt who's done a series on here about sleep would now say you know it's great that we're now focused largely on the things that one can do to get agency over one's sleep but I I think that there's such a thing as creating a uh sleep need anxiety and then you know can't sleep we're not going to dissolve into a puddle of our own Tears On One poor night's sleep yeah no but it's also that um if you can't if you're not sleeping what is the reason for that and if you're stressed you know obviously it's the stress that's the problem not the number of hours sleep you're getting well I always say if you're going to get uh less than your typical or NE required night's sleep hopefully it's for good reasons hopefully you're having a good time it's it's it's when you get the fire alarm in the middle of the night that that becomes as you said stressful um I'd like to just briefly go back to the um counterclockwise study could you describe a little bit more about the um the Practical aspects of that study so these were people who let's say were on average how old was it somewhere between like 30 and 50 no no no no no counterclockwise and these were people who were 80 oh 80 okay excuse me now but also that was when um 80 was 80 not the new 60 they were old in fact I remember when we were interviewing I was interviewing people to see if they can be in the study so um they're down the hall I'm in my office and I see them and they look like they're not going to make it down the hall to the office and I'm saying to myself why am I doing this you know that I'm taking on too much you know I in fact had I realized all the responsibility uh at that point that I was actually assuming I probably wouldn't have done it I mean I was in charge of these people's lives everything about them for you know for this five days without knowing these people without a full medical you know support system one or two of them had died you could end up in a mess yeah yeah I was fortunate that none of that happened but no so they were old um and um it was interesting because you know they show up and they look you know really now it probably be somebody 105 that's the way they you know present it um and you'd have you'd speak to the person and usually the adult daughter would do the answering rather than you know so they were coddled they were presumed to to have all sorts of um problems and so on almost instantly when they got there they changed the feeling was almost palpable now I did this thing wasn't good science but um so the first group that we took there was the reminiscent group group this was a group where they were going to reminisce for that week so they always knew now was now and then was then right that was a a control group we get to the retreat and um I'm in this van oh people you know people need to understand the study was uh back before Google before we had the internet you know so when I am playing music in the van going to the event music from the past this was a major thing to find this now it takes two minutes you ask Chad lately you know give me the 10 best songs back uh 20 years ago at any rate um so I'm on the uh on the bus with them music playing from the past playing we get very close to the retreat and all of a sudden I realize that not I was sexist at the time oblivious um that uh none of my male graduate students were with me that meant I had seven old men and at least seven heavy suitcases there was no way that I was going to carry their suitcases upstairs so um unplanned for we get off the bus and I say you're in charge of your own suitcase I don't care if you move it an inch at a time to get it to your room or you unpack it here a shirt at a time however you want to do it now imagine nothing else the difference between somebody who's cuddled who's not even thought to be able to respond to a question you know where the daughter or son would answer for them to now they're in charge of their whole lives and um that meant that even the comparison group was going to do well which they did just not quite as well as the other group and for me that was fine because as you mentioned before my work is all about possibility I'm not interested in describing what is I'm interested in seeing what may be you know so um if I got um one monkey to say hey Ellen that's nonsense that would be fine if we couldn't train the rest of them you know but it would lead us to different views of language I love this approach to science of seeing what may be I have to say there's this a little script running in the back of my mind and now I'm not going to judge it the sorts of experiments and the general line of inquiry that you've been involved in for you know some time now to me runs countercurrent to my perception of I'm just going to be honest because I'm a West Coast guy the Harvard campus and the and the the idea that science has done in a particular way um you know a very brief anecdote you know the folks that founded at The esselin Institute in Big Sur were at Stanford at one point they weren't professors but there's a story and I believe the story that they had proposed at that time um a class on mindfulness and breathing to bring Stan graph through and some other people and this was probably the the late 7s early 80s and whatever the cultural norms were at Stanford at that time they claimed they were basically runoff campus went and started esselin I don't know if it's a true story but I like the story anyway my lab at Stanford ran a study on particular patterns of breathing along with David Spiegel and how it can be used to you know self adjust stress levels and reduce stress levels okay so now and nowadays there's grants given for this kind of stuff and meditation so there's been a huge shift in the in the in the academic cultural millu but given that you've been running these sorts of you know seeing what may be types of studies for a number of years at a campus that I consider as more kind of like East Coast died in the wool Notions of how science is done I want to know a how was it received early on B did you care C is it in your nature and has it always been in your nature to kind of test the elements because I sense but I could be completely wrong because I'm not a psychologist that that you Delight in kind of um not poking the bear but playing with ideas that are um kind of heretical well I would use the methods of the field it was just the questions that were different so they weren't seen to to be quite as different as you're uh suggesting did any of your colleagues think like like great okay no I love hearing that because it shatters my Notions of of kind of um East Coast I League AC I mean perhaps behind my back but well clearly it's worked out and nowadays you know there are multiple Labs at Harvard working on happiness you know working on mindfulness and I mean you've pioneered an entire field and a way but I'm more interested in the way of thinking um that was the the so it's interesting 8-year-old Ellen Langer like well maybe cookies are the the nutritious stuff you I know I understand so I seem to be um you know come hella high water I'm going to do it I'm not like that at all more now that I'm older but I tell a story um I don't remember what the point of it the exact point was in the mindful body where I'm met the dentist I'm a little kid I don't remember how old and I remember my mother came in and the dentist told my mother what a patient I was and all I remember was my saying what were the other kids doing you know so it wasn't as if I made a choice I could do this or I could do you know it never occurred to me and so lots of these ideas you know are not um against or what you know I don't know where they come from I know Lee Ross when you know so Lee was a professor at Stanford and I remember having a conversation where he said Ellen you know you're from Mars and I said said I I'm Not So Different he says okay so you're a normal not an exceptional Martian but you're still a martian um and then a colleague um had a conversation with and and I was flattered by this but I think it it wasn't meant to be flattering because they were worried what my reaction was was that you know I'm from a different uh time um and you know so that plays differently if you're aware you know so like when I started painting um you know um I was breaking the rules to some people's minds but no I didn't know the rule and so I was just doing what felt natural I have to introduce you to my good friend Rick Rubin who's been on this podcast a few times because he he wrote the creative act he's he's basically his life has been spent you know trying to pull out the best creative works from musicians and and he's been involved in other things too and he's just has a you know a kind of Supernatural level of ability to do this he keeps coming back to this thing in our discussions but also in his book and and elsewhere about how the the the impediment the greatest impediment to the creative process is to think about the publicity or cultural milu that it's going to exist in that he really believes that that these things are offerings to to the to God to the universe to whatever um that come through us and that the the barrier is the the it's almost like the self-awareness is the barrier so uh one of the earlier titles of the mindful body was who says so love it and you know realizing that everything that is was at one point a decision made by people with different motives different histories different needs um and um when you put people as I say back in the equation everything becomes mutable everything you know so and so there are thing here's where I am different from uh from many other people better or worse my think in this case for better you know that I everything can be changed you know you tell me you meet this you know this woman and she's too heavy weight can be lost hair can be grown everything can be changed so I I'd give a talk when I was very young and I um I'm here on the stage and you know the audience is all the way back here and I knew that was going to make me nervous so what I did was move all the chairs to be closer to me now if you said to anybody can you move the chairs everybody would say of course but mindlessly it doesn't occur to you it doesn't occur to you that what is doesn't have to be as it is and it you know uh the older I get the uh the more malleable everything seems to be even a thing you know to go back I don't know why this comes to mind but it does um if um an insurance company is making a decision about what drugs to insure now who said that this disorder is better or more worthy than that dis I say so these are people making this decision so imagine that you have a group of nuns they're the committee making the decision versus a group of Lusty 50-year-old men and they're deciding whether people should be reimbursed for um Viagra for example you and that's what it's all about you know that when you recognize that whatever is could be different is meetings and I I deal with this uh when I give lectures you know at some point I might say uh look in the audience and see if there's usually a man is there a man here it's about 65 somebody always there I don't know why six5 men find me attractive I don't know what anyway invite him to the stage and then we look ridiculous I'm 53 he's 65 and um I ask him to put his hand he puts his hand up his hand is three inches larger than mine and then I just raised the question should we do anything physical the same and it's ridiculous you know but one of us is teaching how to do it you know so the more different you are from the person who wrote the rule the more important it is for you not to mindlessly follow the rule so you don't hold the tennis racket like this if your hand is half the size of the person who or twice the size or you or anything else and people don't realize it that everything that is was a decision for something to be a decision means there was uncertainty as soon as the decision is made we forget all that uncertainty and act as if this is the way it's supposed to be an example I often use you know tennis so you have and everybody when you think about this and nobody's going to argue that of course the rules to tennis weren't handed down from the heavens somebody decided it should be two serves and that's fine but for me three serves would be better the first time I kill it doesn't go in now I'm afraid to try to kill it again and learn from that because I don't want to double fold so I have a little wuss second surf if I had three surfs I kill it it doesn't go and now I learn from that I kill it again but I'm getting a little better and I still have my backup third Serve All right so what is the point of that that if I wrote the rules to the game I would be a better tennis player you would be better at whatever you you're writing the rules to so you think differently about yourself you don't feel bad about it in fact you know when people play tennis with me we often play three servs why not you know everything about it is up for grabs and um you know so what happens is the lower down you are on the totem pole the fewer of these things games ways of being that you yourself have created the more you're trying to fit yourself into some form that um isn't so comfortable so we need to appreciate that rules laws everything was just somebody's decision about how things should be and you know don't violate them purposely but if they don't fit um you know legality is not the same thing as morality you know by law one was not allowed interracial marriage by law one was not allowed to be gay by law law you know so on and so forth one wasn't allowed to drink at one point and so on these are not moral issues these are a group of people who are making a decision for the rest of us if it doesn't hurt fine but um you know if it does fight it deviate at least live the life you want to live I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors function last year I became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing function provides over 100 Advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily Health this snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health Hormone Health immune functioning nutrient levels and much more they've also recently added tests for toxins such as BPA exposure from harmful Plastics and tests for paases or forever chemicals function not only provides testing of over a 100 biomarkers key to your physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors who are expert in the relevant areas for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood function not only helped me detect that but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption I've been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetal cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and I should say by taking a second function test that approach worked comprehensive blood testing is vitally important there's so many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test the problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated in contrast I've been super impressed by function Simplicity and at the level of cost it is very affordable as a consequence I decided to join their scientific Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function you can go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 200 50,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman podcast listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function I feel like one of the major detriments to living the way that you're describing um which by the way has tremendous gravitational pull in my mind like it's it's such a better way to go through life right um and I subscribe also to this notion that pretty Prett much everything was made up besides the laws of nature right I mean to me physics is real and uh chemistry is real biology gets biology is real it gets tricky because they're they're all real but it's our understanding of them that varies so we haven't worked out all of physics yet sure um you know or biology or any of these other things so I don't think that we should set these aside and say those rules we should follow come hell high water right I mean um you know seeing what may be like I I mean I could say listen uh because of the laws of gravity objects fall down not up but of course there there are we could create exceptions to that but that humans make up all sorts of rules culture dictates group think dictates and it seems that one of the major detriments to living in this Freer way this more exploratory way that we're talking about today is this whole thing of theory of Mind m M you know that we are able For Better or Worse to get into the minds of others and in some cases create ideas true or not about how we will be judged if we do a b or c and in doing so we give up we give up some real estate we give up some see that's the okay so that's perfect um Andrew because we think we know but are oblivious to the fact that every sing every sing it's a big statement Behavior can be UND stood in equal Dimensions equal potency as good or bad now so that I can control what you're thinking so you think that I'm gullible you could persuade me that I'm gullible I can try my hardest not to be gullible but I'm going to eventually be gullible the reason for that is that I value being trusting and as long as I value being trusting I'm going to be seen as gble as long as you value being flexible you're going to be inconsistent as long as you value being stable you're going to be seen as boring and so on and so this is what I said to you before in in uh different terms that with all that I've studied found um found interesting over all these decades the thing that meant the most to me was the realization that behavior makes sense from the actor's perspective or the actor wouldn't do it now if you think about that that means every sing single time you're demeaning somebody or yourself or you're you're coming up with a New Year's resolution what you're doing is denying the sense of what you were doing and saying oh you should have done something different okay um once you realize that your behavior makes sense um you like yourself more uh when you're realizing that you know uh in any relationship anything that's difficult is difficult because one of you thinks there's a right way and is denying the other person's perspective we did this thing so many years ago I gave people a list of uh I don't remember it was two or 300 Behavior descriptions I said Circle those things about yourself that you keep trying to change but you keep failing it so for me I'd Circle impulsive um gullible I won't tell you the rest okay then you turn the page over and in a mixed up random order are the positive versions of each of these now people are asked Circle those things you really value about yourself my spontaneity and my being trusting and as long as I value being spontaneous I'm going to appear impulsive um and so on and so now that I have more respect for myself because what I did made sense I carry myself differently um I'm I'm not doing what you were just suggesting before where I'm tormenting myself and you know and so on um and the people I'm with you know there's a lot in the mindful body that deals with language and only a fraction of the Sensitivity I seem to have um to language in in a different way from the way linguist would study it um but you have things you know um let's say forgiveness we have all these terms that seem good and you know because you you figured me out now that if you say it's good I'm going to find a way it's bad if you say it's bad I'm good okay so this is one of those I don't want anybody certainly not the person closest to me to ever forgive me I want to be understood and if you understand there's no reason to forgive me because my behavior will make sense or else I wouldn't do it okay so how did this come about I was asked to give a sermon sermon I'm Jewish don't I have to go to this church I because I say yes to everything and I'm going to give a sermon what am I going to talk about I know nothing about religion talk forgiveness it's not religion but it sounds religiously all right I'll think about forgiveness I think about forgiveness and what I came up with was sacrilegious some would think if you ask 10 people is forgiveness good or bad what are they going to tell you going tell you it's yeah if you ask 10 people is blame good or bad what are they going to say bad but you know you can't forgive unless you first blame so our forgivers are our blamers that's interesting now do you blame people for good things or bad things you blame thing people for bad things but things that in of themselves aren't good or bad so what happens is the people who see the world negatively who blame then forgive hardly Divine now if you blame it's better to forgive than not forgive but if you understand why the person did what they did it obviates the necessity for blame which then obviates the necessity for forgiveness I'd love to bypass blame yeah well that that's you know I think that's the way to do it is to recognize uh in a a more open-minded way uh the the motivations that people have vary the consequences um you know no matter what you do do uh whatever negative thing it seems there you know positive things will follow if you allow them and you look at it that way can I ask you to no oh that's right it's your podcast yes you can definitely not my podcast we're here together um could I ask you for any Reflections that come up around this recent thought train I was uh on um I was laughing at the fact that our species for whatever reason seems to keep wanting to build Technologies and that much of our effort these days is focused on trying to undo some of the ills of the technologies that we've developed so I I use smartphones and I love them and I use social media and I think it's terrific for certain things but of course these things have issues just like the automobile created issues the television created issues and on and on okay fossil fuels and all of this people will debate fossil fu but anyway you get the point every technology brings with it some convenience um or some uh way that humans have been able to overcome nature in some way or work with nature right you know we can't fly so we build planes we okay and I just decide to look at this through a different lens like like this is amazing we're sending Rockets into space we'll probably colonize Mars not too long from now if Elon figures it out and I get the sense he probably will we've got AI just this last week There's this whole think and so then I started thinking like you know at what point do we just kind of stop and the answer is pretty clear it's unlikely that humans are ever going to stop this kind of itch to develop technology and I thought wow you know like we're the only species that does this like you know if the raccoons get together and they think okay like let's figure out how to pick locks like actually how to pick locks as opposed to just go in through crawl spaces if they've been working on that they're still failing miserably right as far as I know so it it's something so unique to our species among the Old World primates to develop Technologies other animals do it crows do it other primates do it but but we special I mean we are really the utmost example of this and I just wonder like what do you think the human compulsion is to develop Technologies I don't think there's a compulsion to develop anything in particular I think there's a compulsion to develop there's a compulsion I wouldn't call it compulsion because that sounds negative um but I think that drive yeah no all mindfulness is is noticing new things creating new things um with that creation we're maximally alive and so if we happen to be on the technology train you know uh then it's technology that's going to get our attention um the people who are in other areas whether it's creating music doing what you you know you and I do um it doesn't seem to me any different in principle what do you think that's about I'm not asking us to go into evolutionary psychology but what what do you think it is that that humans have this generative spirit in their mind body U same thing um to to express and to create things that have some durability in time or that are just an expression of of of where we are I mean it's so unusual I don't think but I don't think that um it's durability is what matters I think then that becomes a social construction you know um what is the the group The Asian you know monks who are going to create art and you know as soon as it's finished then you bring it down to the water and you know uh to show that nothing lasts yeah sand castle no selfie I call it you know you sand castle no selfie just doing it to do it I actually do a lot of writing these days that I like in my brain I've always called sand castle no selfie like it's you're it's getting washed away and then someone says we take a photo of it it's like nope actually I just do it just to see it's just a practice of getting out what I'm I feel I need to get out well so for my mindfulness book which I wrote way back when uh the uh secretary I had then was wonderful guy but um didn't know anything about computers and I knew less and so I would give him something and I'd say you know insert this page 20 whatever and uh he would just sort of randomly cuz he didn't know what he was doing either and um then at some point he lost an entire draft of the book a sort of imagine you know and my first thought was um probably more typical than my second thought which is so crazy oh my God you know and then I said to myself what makes me think that that draft was better than the next draft that I can come up with you know in some sense a version of your who cares and um then I just started working on it again you know um at some point when you're writing these research papers I think most people come to the point where first numbers count right how many publication you know then at some point the game changes and you don't care about the number um and that's freeing and uh so it seems seems a little similar I think that for people to recognize that that excitement can be gotten the threading of the needle as I said before um would make uh much of Life feel differently you know so we we did um this is going to seem strange kind of answer here but um we took people who didn't like rap music people who didn't like football people who didn't like art okay so a lot of haters people don't like anything one group is just given the activity the next group is asked to notice one new thing about it the next group three new things about it they're doing it or observing it uh well if it's football they're observing it doesn't matter if you're observing the rear ends of the football players just noticing new things and the more you notice the more you like what you're noticing and to recognize that that's how simple it is now most people especially when you're younger you're waiting for something to pull you you something to grab me and get me all excited and how freeing if people were taught that you could grab it whatever the it is just by noticing you don't have to hold on to the thing you're holding on to when you're recognizing that you could hold on to the next thing I saw this Seinfeld This was so funny I thought um must been old Seinfeld he you after the show he does a five minute standup and I'm going to not do it as well as he but nor should I and he says what is this thing with appetites you know you go out to dinner and people say don't eat the bread you're going to spoil your appetite there's so many appetites you spoiled this one there's another one right behind it you know and if if you realize that that high that total engagement the passion you were feeling was not um a result of anything particular about the person the Conta the context um how freeing it would be it'd be easy to let things go knowing that you can have that you know a moment later this is why at some point in my life I'm going to tell my team six months and I'm done and I'm going to go do art and um I just don't want to scare anybody um but I just I love the idea of being able to switch venue and possibly to even change identity which is something I'd like to talk to you about well the art is is kind of interesting you know that I started painting when I was about 50 and I was one of those kids who couldn't draw um and I going know someone think of Education what Mark might I have made on a page that would have led an elementary school teacher to you know to lead me to believe that I had no artistic ability when you think of a difference between a mreal a rembrand uh you know I mean people so different um that it's sinful for people to think they know how things should be so they know who can do it and who can't um as if there's only one way to do whatever it is and I had this experience um and very clear in my mind so I have this painting and um I have this friend who um is an art collector she drinks a little too much she came over for a visit and she saw the painting very early painting of mine and she looks at it just Ellen there's something there this is the important bues now don't go thinking you're rembrand okay which wasn't nice but she had a little too much but it didn't matter but my response was so important to me I didn't say it because I didn't think it would go over well but I said and Rembrandt isn't me now I would rather be the very best Ellen Langer than the 500,000th 5 millionth whatever rembrand and when you recognize that um Quality is a decision people are making there is no absolute standard you know if you know anything about art I mean you know let's take even uh the Impressionists for people who pay so much money today they were all rejected in their day um you know when you when you realize that in some ways and my work has suggested this to me that if you're present when you're doing it you're mindful when you're doing it somehow that reveals itself um in uh what you're doing and uh whether or not it does you're putting yourself on that canvas um and it's great fun it's exhilarating and um you know when somebody you know belittles it um it's strange to me you know where where are those criteria coming from no different from in schools you know I I'm very much in favor of trying to create mindful education because as I said before I think that it's our system of Education that has caused most of the mindlessness and you know a slide that I put on but I give some of these talks in my view that virtually I don't really mean virtually I have to say because I'm an academic right all I believe all of our ills all of them Andrew personal interpersonal professional Global are the indirect or direct effect of our mindlessness so here we have schools all over the country teaching these absolutes um propagated in um magazines newspapers you know uh taught by our parents taught to each other all that are limiting us and causing the the problems that we keep trying to solve and how easy it would be if we just acknowledge everybody doesn't know something every every body knows something else everybody can't do something everyone can do something else so when you're grading that paper and you're so sure that this paper you know just doesn't make it um to presume that every smart person in the world would evaluate that the same way I find distasteful um so constantly you know you give tests in school to find out what people don't know give tests to find out what they do know turns out it's the best way to learn i' uh researched an episode of us solo episode this podcast I did and to figure out what are the best ways to study and learn it was based on a course that i' had um guest lectured in at Stanford it turns out um we have to be careful now I have to be careful with saying things like the best one of the one of the most um effective ways to learn is to self test for what one knows and doesn't know but not for sake of evaluation but for sake of of enhancing recall and depth of of consolidation um and I think all of us in at least in this country I'm saying something a little different you know is you're saying how to remember which I agree with that completely but I'm saying that when we're testing people we whoever the wi is decided what is important to know to see does that student know that ignoring all the other things that student must know you know um I said this before that when I was lecturing in South Africa and they put me up in this very fancy hotel and I had taken a few hours off and I was down by the pool and I you know there was this enormous amount of the hotel space the real estate that was totally unused the only person who knew that was the lowely Cabana Boy Who nobody is going to ask what his opinion is you know everybody has a perspective that can add to the the you know the larger piece and by having this idea of there are those of us on top we really know you know people expect and I was given this genius award and you know shortly afterwards every time you and you're supposed to be a genius I never claimed the danger of awards that carry things titles like genius or or even Nobel um you know I'm not going to poke at my few friends that happen to have nobels because they've done beautiful work but it's rare that people who get nobels do much after that they become great sources of fundraising for universi so geted um but and I don't thinkone going to AAR for AEL Prize winner here but I this BRS me to this notion of labels not just rankings and performance but labels I mean we labels hide all the ambiguity so if I you know we can use uh grades when I give a student an A versus a b it sounds like they're very different but imagine and I've studied this um uh with respect to health that the person who gets an 89 so you go from an 80 to an 89 you get a b a 90 to 100 you get an A nobody in the right mind would think there's a real difference between the person who's gotten the 89 and the person who's gotten the 90 but their worlds become very different you know all the ambiguity is hidden we studied this it's the borderline effect as we call it where so imagine let's say you and I take an IQ test and for argument sake that you get a 70 so you're normal I get a 69 so I'm cognitively deprived I could have sneezed and read the question wrong I could have um come up with multiple answers that could have been better than the one that got the question and person who wrote the question and so on but now we're put into two different categories and because I'm cognitively deficient I'm not given the training that I should be given I no longer think well of myself um and so if you asked me to read certain things I'd probably opt out and so on and in a very short time the difference become between us becomes very real well it's the same thing with a medical diagnosis there is always somebody who's right below the Border who has it or we say who doesn't have it I'm above or below and the person right above or at that has it where the two scores are not meaningfully different but where one then is told they have the disease and the other not and the difference becomes real over time and um so we have data supporting that and it's almost just a gonan experiment a thought experiment you know um you know at some point you have to you know put a limit and say you know but but you need to always know that it's made up so you know when what is the expiration date for this can of food well I mean there are people who actually go through their shelves and throw these things out because it's two weeks old not realizing how did they come up with that date in the first place you know um anyway so to go back to what you're saying remind you now cuz I'm having the junior moment that labels names of things these categories uh help us organize things but more often or as often um hold things still and um cause problems you know um I did that first study way back when uh called a patient by any other name and um we had uh we made a videotape of a person being interviewed and showed it to therapists who were either U Behavior therapists or fian types and the person on the tape was called either a patient or a job applicant so the exact same tape when we called the person a patient they were seen as having hidden this and problems and that and so on when the person was called a job applicant they were seen as well adjusted I have a friend who was in uh elite elite special operations for a number of years very smart guy very philosophical and he once said to me for reasons that I don't recall uh he said you know the two most powerful but also dangerous words in the English language are I am because anything that follows the words I am will completely constrain your Notions of what's possible and what's not possible and I said you know why why are you telling me this right because I pointed out that he was from Special Operations he said you know that he uh and his teammates had a a mode of refreshing their um mindset around particular operations that were because of the division of the military he was in ETC was quite varied it wasn't like they were just sort of doing one type of thing they had to be very adaptive and he said that um they had to completely wipe away this I am component of their vocabulary except as it related to um the word adaptive it was like I am adaptive so but there was never a title to who they were what they were once they entered the context of a planning execution of one of these operations very very interesting way of of thinking about identity how it shapes mindset how it constrains it and opens doors um and converts things into um action and uh or or failure to to execute yeah yeah I I found it very intriguing that you know because here's a guy wouldn't normally think like think of this stuff but it turned out he said that was a very potent tool for them yeah well think that um as soon as you're learning something and if you have your sense of um as if you're going to be the same person over the next 70 years for example uh we don't actually cognize that but without literally realizing that you're not going to be the same person and you take in whatever you've just learned and continue doing it the exact same way you know we go back to tennis you learn the game of ten When You're 15 um and now you're 40 you you shouldn't be doing any of it the same way why do you think we get now you're 80 um again and so what happens is your performance is not going to be as good as it could be because the 80-year-old body is trying to do it as if it's a 15year old rather than taking advantage of their positive things that happen as you get older they're not all negative you know that I mean if I'm playing tennis with u I don't know 15-year-old kid um I'm going to win without having to move very much because they don't know what they're doing you know so that you don't need the same skills the more experience you have with the task necessarily at least you see what I'm saying is that we freeze we freeze our own behavior every time you learn something the way we learn everything it just uggles the mind you learn learn how to drive and then you freeze the way you're learning how to drive when you know the least about how to drive you know and and that's the way you're going to do it for the rest of your life a driving thing just as a not really appropo of anything except in the car that if you're driving on ice what do you do a car starts a skid you're driving on Ice I California you don't pay I know what you don't do you don't slam on the breaks you come off you you slowly come off the gas I've driven on the East Coast a little bit that's exactly wrong Andrew that used to be the case you say so you first this is this is the way we learn everything you start on the way things are right now that when you skid we were told that what you're supposed to do is gently Hit The Brak and turn into the now that there are antiock brakes the only way the safest way to stop that car is to jam on the breaks so but just think about it because it's the way we learn everything you learn in this case you're learning how to drive for safety sake and then you mindlessly you know continue that and it becomes very unsafe um I didn't get the memo okay no most people don't that's why I brought it up now uh seeming appropo of almost nothing but um we need to understand that things are changing and pay attention to the way that they're changing and change with it and you know the more you hold yourself you're talking about identity the more you hold yourself still uh the harder that's going to be um you know I I'm I'm much older as most people are than I used to be but I don't have any sense of age I I really don't in fact the other day the other day now means years ago um I was helping uh this woman with something and um somebody dear to me said you know you're probably 20 years older than she is I had no sense I thought I was helping this this old person age is just not a relevant factor for me sometimes you want to be aware of age um we did some research where um we have people who you know they're accused in the environment that often uh tell us how old we are and those um are not always so good so for example if I at my age I'm in a fancy store and I go to buy um let's say a dress was skirt okay um it would be inappropriate for me to buy a miniskirt and I'm too old to be wearing almost nothing there right um so clothing tells you how old the person is now we did research just archival research with people who wore uniforms so if you're wearing a uniform from the first day you start working you're there 30 years there's no difference okay there's no age relevant CU and in those situations uh are healthier really yeah because they're not getting the cube at they're old I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors our place our place makes my favorite pots pans and other cookware now I've discussed on this podcast before that the pases or forever chemicals like Teflon have been linked to major health issues such as endocrine disruption that means hormone disruption gut microbiome disruption fertility issues and many other health problems so it's really important to avoid them this is why I recently fell in love with ourplace products especially one of their cooking pans the titanium always pan pro ourplace products are made with the highest quality materials and are all past and toxin-free they're beautifully designed and function extremely well for all your cooking

it's extremely easy to clean and like all ourplace products it's nice to look at when sitting on the counter or on the stove for a limited time ourplace is offering an exclusive 20% discount on their Innovative titanium always pan Pro designed to last a lifetime and completely toxin free visit fromourplace decom huberman and use use the code save hubman 20 to claim the offer so if one has parents let's say who are quote unquote slowing down a bit um and they're talking a little bit about some aches and pains and they're and there is a stairwell in the house for instance and they're starting to say things like you know at some point we're either going to have to move into a place that doesn't have a stairwell or put one of those chair lift things or or um or maybe just move into the downstairs do you think that in just thinking about that they're going to accelerate their um their the demise of their locomotor ability I do actually um I think that when we start entertaining these negative thoughts and evaluating ourselves we're always going to find evidence you know as you get older you start oh my God am I forgetful so you you pay attention each time you forget and that makes it even worse well I said to my students uh in this health class smart kids at Harvard this is on uh Thursday I teach Tuesday and Thursday I said what was the last thing I said in class on Tuesday nobody remembers I said you must be getting dementia you know all right so that when a young person forgets it's okay they don't pay any attention to the forgetting as you get older and you forget you you get less involved in what you're doing if you're trying to learn something you had the competing uh part of you saying you know that you're not going to remember this and so on and and independent of all of this I think a lot of the loss in memory has nothing to do with memory you know uh there when I was young and and you're introducing me to people I thought it was important for me to remember their names Andre I know doesn't speak well of me I don't really care you're going to introduce me to five of your what do I care if I'm going to need their names chances are I will meet them again right so after was if you say to me remember Jim and I say to you which one was Jim it wasn't that I forgot to forget means I had to have learned it in the first place and so if you don't learn it in the first place because you don't care because you're you're um values uh change as you get older then it's not a matter of forgetting when you don't know it in the second place um and I think that and if we turn it around because now I'm doing this because I know you expect it of me and we say what if you remembered everything everything that Terri how would you get through you know you wouldn't get to experience anything new um so forgetting you know uh serves a purpose and um I used to think I never tested this and now I came up with this years ago and I think it's probably wrong but it's kind of fun that people as they get older they become hard of hearing but it also happens that the older you get the more you realize nobody's really saying anything and so being hard of hearing protects you from a lot of that um you know noise yeah my grandfather us to turn off his he you know I started we I've I've always um had glasses for reading at night when my eyes would get fatigued or or something but recently I I came to my awareness that my vision at a distance is very very sharp I'm like an eagle I can you know read numbers you know you know very far away but Vision my vision up close has been um diminishing I find myself straining a bit more even did so I started wearing you know eyasses have the book further away I should have the book further away but you know I've just have defaulted to eyeglasses and then um but I realized that because I understand the the neuroplasticity of the visual system that I'm certainly accelerating the demise of my near Vision um by wearing glasses and so I'm trying to you know balance the two well do you know our Vision study this is kind of fun so I'm in the doctor's office and like everybody else I'm given the Snelling ey chart the letter is the Snelling is the letters and numbers yeah okay and you know but I'm different from most people and I resent that the letters are getting smaller and smaller because it's creating an expectation that soon I won't be able to see so I ask what would happen if the letters got larger and larger which would be to change the expectation that soon I will be able to see so when we do that people are able to see what they weren't able to see before now most of us have trouble around 2third of the way down the chart so um what we did was start the chart a third of the way down so letters are smaller than on top um so now 2/3 of the way down that starting point the letters are really small and what happens is again people can see what they couldn't see before awesome yeah so the idea that your vision has to get worse um I don't uh I think there are many many instances where that's not the case but also the whole test of vision is bizarre how often in your life are you looking at letters that make no sense you know if I don't want to see you I'm going to see you a lot sooner be able to run away from you if I'm hungry I can see the restaurant sign um much quicker than if I'm not hungry I see things in color that are different in black and white you know so on and so forth and to lose all of that with a two-dimensional uh eye test seems to me you know and again you know we haven't touched on this but it's probably important with respect to Vision it's true with everything you know um in fact I tell people you're wearing glasses um try it without glasses you want to see when you can see and when you can see with almost everything um we again um hold things still when they're varying now what I mean by this is that let's say with vision my guess is that um 11 o'clock in the morning my vision is better than at 7 o'clock at night the data yes okay I me it'd be hard for it night so what does this say that says maybe I should either have uh a nap I don't nap so I should have an energy bar and even an energy bar is cute it's just a candy bar but you call it an energy bar you're allowed to eat it it's like you take a piece of cake put it in a muffin tin it's called a muffin it's healthier than the piece of cake anyway all that be that as it may um that control a um a great amount of control over our physical well-being comes about by attention to variability which is just a fancy way of talking about mindfulness mindfulness is noticing change that's what it means to be variable all right so if you took your glasses off and you saw for yourself what are the times what are the moments that you're having I'm not talking about people who are you know almost blind um where I can't see and when I can see and then you ask yourself why and then it may be the case that um it's a particular font or more likely that you're tired and then you have other options but once you start wearing them it's like taking a laxative you know take a laxative once it's fine if you're taking a laxative all the time you're teaching your body to depend on the laxative you teach ourselves by some of these um uh things that are supposed to be helpful that we teach ourselves to to need them in ways we otherwise wouldn't and so he did this attention to symptom variability with big diseases so when you have a chronic illness first way most people understand chronic illness is that there's nothing that can be done about it yeah the word chronic implies that exactly but all it means is the medical world doesn't have a fix it doesn't mean there's nothing can be done now you have your symptoms with the chronic illness the presumption most of the time I would think is that the symptoms are going to stay the same or get worse nothing only Moves In One Direction sometimes it's a little better sometimes a little the stock market it's going up it doesn't go up in a straight line goes up down a little up you know and so on all right so when it's better why is it better so we do this um we call people periodically and we simply ask them how is the symptom now is it better or worse than the last time we called and why several things happen the first by engaging in the whole process people feel less helpless and that turns out to be good for your health second once you start noticing that now it's a little better I can even be a little worse you feel better because you thought that it was you know always maximally I'm always in pain I'm always stressed whatever it is third or whatever I'm up to um by asking the question why now is it better or worse than before you engage in a mindful search and I have Decades of evidence that that mindfulness itself the neurons are firing that itself is good for your health and then finally I believe you're more likely to find a solution if you're looking for one so we've done this with multiple sclerosis chronic pain uh Parkinson's stroke biggies and in each case have very positive results and the good thing about these sorts of things is that there are no negative side effects and it doesn't mean that you have to stop doing any U medical procedures you may be doing but you know you're asking you're back in charge of your own health care why does this hurt now you know stress there are some people who think they're stressed all the time nobody is anything all the time so I call you um Andrew and I say how stressed are you now and why and we go through this over time and then you find out you know you're stressed when you're talking to illen Langer well then the solution is easy don't talk to me I've been thinking about deadlines a lot lately and we hear stories of you know people being told I need this done in 15 days and if people are forced to do it in 15 days somehow they're able to get it done in 15 days or and certainly there are limits to this if you told me I need to write a thousand pages in five minutes I would there would be very little on each page but staying within the bounds of reason of what we're talking about when we say there's a deadline in X number of days is why do you think it is that our perception of what's possible tends to scale with a what's been done before so precedent or no precedent the four-minute mile for instance um until banister broke it you know no one else broke it he broke it lots of people broken it since um and did immediately afterwards so what do you think about this notion of of what's possible in terms of uh pre-ordained human uh decision constraints like no one can break the four-minute mile some breaks the four-minute mile now we we reset to a real a new reality in time and in sort of capability because I I feel like much of what we believe about ourselves is also constrained by our beliefs about the outside world and as you pointed out earlier all of that's just a human script that is the play we're all in yeah um I think that the first part is what guides most of us is what's been done before and the fact that nobody has done it to me means nothing but to a lot of people see people create theories working backwards you know which is they often take what is and then derive rules to explain why it has to be like that once you believe it has to be like that then it doesn't occur to you to do anything other than that um but if we start off with the Notions of science that I was talking about before that it's old POS um probability no absolutes then it wouldn't occur to you um to to stay within the rigid boundaries not the best answer but the only one that came to mind no it's a great answer I'm trying to think about um the use of the scientific method which is what you use in your in your lab and in your research um and why it is that you haven't um it seems challenged the scientific me method itself except at the level of like what hypothesis you're going to test I mean in order to do great science I mean at some point you need St you need statistics you need sample size to be sufficient um you know the the rigor of your studies is as important as the um the originality of the questions you're asking and so it seems that you've you've embraced the scientific method as as it least useful yeah that's that's the key that to me it's a means of speaking to certain people and it carries with a certain gravitas but I by no means feel that it's giving answers that um are any more absolute well as I said before that all the answers are probabilities so it's just a language to use um you know the uh counterclockwise study um was criticized because I didn't publish it in a standard Journal because my assumption of um the com you know it's very hard if you're doing something over a week's time to control every possibility and what I was trying to do in that study was uh to show that vision for example can be improved that lots of the things that people presume wired in as you get older it gets worse and worse um that just doesn't have to be that way but um I'm having trouble remembering now because I know that I was going to write a paper taking the whole uh science of science apart and never did and if I had written the paper I'd probably remember what I was going to say and answer your question what it it's a good one but I don't um I don't think that there's anything that is described as absolute that's going to be right whether it's physics even physics um biology psychology anything you know that our methods can only take us so far and um the people who get beyond that are the people who don't presume that that's as far as you can go you know if you can go this way you can go a little further I was a chemistry major When I Was An undergraduate and the problem was I practice Jewish chemistry which was a little is good a little more is better you which is not the way to chemistry but I don't know what it is that leads some people to be rigid and to take everything that is told to them as if it must be and uh what it is that led me to to a different way of being um and testing it or just thinking that some of the things that people say just made no sense to me not long ago we went through one of the biggest Public Health crisis of um at least my lifetime and at least two U major controversies arose um one was the extent to which masks should or shouldn't be worn uh and are useful or no the other is about the the so-called vaccines um and this is yeah I think those are beautiful examples because um you know one can make an argument that you should wear masks but the other side also makes sense the way masks were preventing you even non-verbal communication which is very important and important to People's Health right your relationships are not an inconsequential part of your well-being um and um vaccines you know there is no treatment that's going to be good for everybody somebody very close to me uh if given dexadrin puts her to sleep Dex is basically speed exact put you know um and so when we recognize the uncertainty inherent in all of these things I think we don't mandate things in quite the same way now you can mandate that people wear masks but it shouldn't be that people wear masks because we're absolutely certain that masks should be worn there are other arguments to be made why people should wear masks you know or not wear masks or not wear masks you know whatever the case is going to be um and um you know I think it's important that in the medical world you know that I think I gave this talk at one point and I thought I was talking to 5,000 I me 5,000 women with breast cancer and it turned out there were lots and lots of Physicians there if I had known that I I might have spoken a little differently um and scared afterwards I said you oh my goodness because I was not flattering you know I had respect for uh for most of these people um but then I found out afterwards that they were thrilled because they know they don't know and you know operating on the world with an awareness that you can't be sure leads to a different humility a different way of uh appreciating other people when they disagree with you and so on and um I don't know how you do that at the higher level um you know government and and so on um but you this is a maybe a silly example but meaningful to me so I spent a lot of time in Mexico and um there's this very busy intersection and there are no stop signs there are no traffic lights and there are no accidents because everybody knows there's no traffic light there's no stop sign you have to pay attention to what's going on um you you know so lots of these rules and laws divert attention to as if there's only one thing that matters you know so when you're told to drive 60 miles an hour what does that mean you know um and um you know that if you drive 70 you're going to get a ticket okay so if you're not afraid of getting the ticket but there are other considerations to how fast you might go you know the the quality of your car the quality of the roads is it raining at the moment um how uncomfortable or comfortable the passengers are and all of this gets and much more gets lost by having the rule 60 as if that you know somehow um is an absolute truth yeah and experience matters um at least in my view because so for instance going back to vaccines right I'm not trying to create unnecessary controversy here but it's absolutely clear to me that there are people who believe that for instance the covid vaccines were immensely valuable on the whole it saved lives Etc and there are other people who are absolutely convinced that the vaccines caused injury um perhaps to them or to people that they know and both sides as it were seem to know a lot about their side their side and so the discussions aren't really discussions yeah because the people that felt that they had a vaccine injury know an immense amount about that injury the context and others who it yeah the people who had a different experience of the vaccines or have a different stance of the covid vaccine know tremendous amount about the statistics and mass of what the general outcomes were as a consequence okay so it's futile right like like it's not a it's not a meaningful discussion and then what ends up Happ but it didn't have to be that way you know that we go back to the beginning and in school you're asked a question and expected to give a single answer life would be so different for us as we grow up if you gave multiple answers to whatever the question was that immediately would make clear that there are alternative perspectives um just a very simple a simple change in schools well then I'd like to challengeing idea since that seems to be a challenging assumption my ideas no no not one of your ideas I'd like to challenge the assumption that as people get older they become more set in their ways because many times today I'm hearing that as one and I'm getting older I'm now can say I'm so happy I can say I'm almost 50 I'm really I actually love getting older I feel better now to I feel better now at almost 50 than I did in my 20s and psychologically and physically and I felt great then so I I challenge the assumption that we get worse with age yeah no I'm I'm with you and I'm much older than you are so do we get set in our ways or we maybe we're more flexible in our thinking I think that um the older you are let's say you've tried different ways of doing something and there's a particular way that works for you and it doesn't matter if the other way is faster is prettier is whatever this works and so you can be seen as set in your way because you've made it because you know it doesn't really matter I could do it that way that way or this way I'm going to continue to do it this way I think as you get older presumably you've had more mindful experience cuz if if you're you know a robot um you know you're not going to be learning anything and getting more set or less set is an irrelevant question but I remember um you know this goes back to um the pancreas you know my not eating the pancreas like I really believed I had to eat that pancreas to show that I was all grown up so you get a little older and you realize you I wrote this blog once um long time go where you're 2 years old and you fall and you're screaming bloody murder because you scraped your leg and then you're 7 years old and Johnny or Janie didn't send you a Valentine and you're distress you know distroyed and then you're 13 years old and you have a pimple and oh my God you know no one's ever going to find me attracted and it goes on and on and at some point this was all kind of silly and you know um and with that you become easier but sometimes that easier can be misunderstood by others so let me give you an example and I talk about this in the book when I talk about three levels um you know that in the example I use um I have the New Yorker is a wonderful magazine but let's say we have three levels level one people who don't read the New Yorker level two people who read the New Yorker level three people who don't read the New Yorker anymore we could have them read it again but let's just skip first okay okay Level One not reading and those not reading it anymore are very different but they're seen as the Same by the level twos the level two people are the being of my existence all right so let's say you have your young you're uninhibited level one then you're like most people you become very inhibited then hopefully you get to a certain point in life you say who cares and you become disinhibited not uninhibited because you know the rule you're just choosing not to follow it but those at the level two will see the level three and think they're level ones because you can't see beyond your own level of development when you know when I was young especially if I'm on an important show like yours Andrew and um we just took a break for a minute and I if I had eaten something and I got a spot on my sweater I'd sit like this no not even realizing how stupid does this look right but that no one should see that I got you know God forbid you're human you you spilled who cares who so I I do this thing with my students and it's very simple but it has a very big effect on them where I tell them you can't come to class next week unless you're wearing two different shoes it's very hard some won't come to class most come then a large majority where two different shoes that look the same you know two different black sneakers that are you know and then you have the Bold where a red and a and a black sneaker that's cool and we talk about nobody even notice and if they notice what are they noticing somebody who knows you is not going to judge you differently because you're wearing two different they're can assume there's some reason for it and those who don't know you don't know you so what do you care so this wonderful young woman I did this in my seminar as well that was in the lecture class um she comes in she say Professor Langer you won't believe what happened I said what happened I'm in the elevator there's this guy he looks at my feet he looks at my face he looks at my feet he looks at my face he looks at my feet and he points and he says was that intentional you know what I did I said no what did you do she said I looked at his feet I looked at his face I looked at his feet I looked I pointed to his feet and said to him was that you know so good you know and when people recognize that everything is sort of in some sense up for grabs you know that none of it really matters um it's so freeing and there's so many ways that we can strict ourselves and to to make it an answer to your question hopefully you get older and you realize that most of this it just doesn't matter um now you can learn that when you're younger all you need to do is recognize that that those people who you think are thinking your ex are there are other people who are going to go yay your ex you know that you may love me because I'm trusting you may dislike me because I'm gullible it's all you know you can't please everybody not because your behavior is unpleasant but because all of it is up for their own definition and you can't control the way they're going to see it it's like our sense of justice kind of uh gets in the away sometimes I mean sense of justice can be very important in in society so don't get me wrong but uh for instance recently I had an experience where a news story came out it wasn't about me um but and those are the only ones you read right uh it came out and the the headline was well I'm just going to say what it was that um so and so's home this famous person's home was destroyed in the LA fires had um a description of what it happened had a photograph of the home before and after the devastation and I immediately got upset because that was not their home that was my home oh my goodness okay now I hadn't lived in that home in a while so there was no reason for them to say it was my home I wasn't upset that they didn't say it was my home but there was my Toyota 4Runner parked in the driveway oh W like basically the whole thing was made up and I actually know the reporter because they had tried to contact me once before they had somehow got a hold of my phone number which frustrates me uh in in addition to that and I realized that was my fault and I realized they're just making up lies like they're not even attempting to fact check now this was a minor thing whose home it was perhaps but they made a bunch of issues around this and then another article came out about this person and another one and I basically I don't believe anything that I read certainly from that particular venue and then I started to realize that probably half or more of what we read in traditional popular press is just made up and no one's factchecking this stuff because how could they like how could they know and of course I'm not going to pursue this in any kind of legal way I don't really care but my sense of justice is what frustrated me and as soon as I went but what difference that's kind of funny like like this reporter so desperate for a a story and to capitalize on the the horrible like felt that they needed to do and and I thought this is like ridiculous and our species is just so weird this is what I always default to in the end whether or not it's about technology about something else I mean real tragedies are real tragedies and when those happen as the fires were it upsets me but so much of like what grabs our attention and the drama of things is just humans being ridiculous yeah um sometimes lying sometimes in in service to one thing or pretending it's in service to Justice when it's in fact it's in service to themselves or a combination of things I and I think as I've hit this like what I hope is a new Vista in my life I'm thinking to myself like wow like we're we're really um obvious like we're so obviously silly like the game I bring up Rick Rubin again he he has this saying that he repeats over and over to me he said like there are only two truths nature and professional wrestling he loves professional wrestling he watches hours and hours of professional wrestling and I said why do you do that isn't that um he said it's made up and everyone knows it's made up but it doesn't matter which is why it actually is one of the few things that's real because we all know it's made up so whether or not they become allies or they become enemies in a given match or whether or not somebody breaks the rules and the ref pretends they don't see it's theater yeah and it's designed to show you the theater that is human nature yeah I never had any appreciation for professional wrestling I thought but he's right and so once you start looking yourself it doesn't have to be made up or not um if you ask yourself what difference does it make the wrestling no any of it so it's your house it's somebody else's house exactly I I realized I was the one being ridiculous I'm upset because of there's some injustice because what because I I don't want my Forerunner in a news article about someone else's home maybe that person had a home that looked very similar but the I guess it was the the break with my assumption that the traditional media tries to get things right that they at least try and in this case the person clearly didn't even try they they had access to the real information they CH if you say there's something to be learned regardless of whether it's true or not you know I thought you were going someplace else with this my mind wanted to um you I thought you were talking about the tragedy of the fire which um as an example I use in the mindful body to show that um events are not not good bad rather our view of the event is what makes it good or bad and uh so I had this experience I was at a friend's house for dinner I come back late which never happens and all of my um neighbors uh were outside because my house had burned down and um you know which is pretty scary okay um a couple of funny things happened they said uh they were able to save my dogs which that wasn't funny that was Wonder but they couldn't save the parrot parrot I didn't have a par well Roger Brown when he was alive gave me this stuffed parrot that was in CAG okay A K who own parot I was like writing for a moment par okay um so now I stay at a friend's house and the next day I called the um insurance company and um the uh person comes over and he said this was the first time in his 20-year career that the the damage was worse than the call um most people oh my God oh my God it's not so bad here I had already lost everything so it didn't make sense to throw my sanity away after it okay so that the first thing I move into the Charles hotel and I'm a sight to be seing with my two little dogs and um it's Christmas then all the presents coming in you know we're burned all the ones going out you know um it's now Christmas Eve and I go out um for dinner and I come back to the hotel room and it's full of gifts not from the owner of the hotel not from the management but from the so-called little people the chambermaids the people who parked my car the waiters and waitresses Andrew I tell you I could not tell that story for months maybe years without it bringing tears to my eyes it was beautiful every Christmas I'm reminded about what feels to me the basic goodness of people and I couldn't tell you except for one thing what I lost in that fire so you know um one stuffed parrot no no that I don't remember that until right now no it was kind of fun I was teaching uh going to be teaching you know as soon as school began again a large lecture class and all my notes were burned and so oh my God what am I going to do and so what I did was was I called a student who got an A in the course the year before borrowed her notes and admitted those and U taught the course but and it was the best course I ever taught because um I was not relying on anything that I would then repeat in you know in any absolute I was totally there uh for each lecture um what do you think it is about about hard events that are life-changing that um anchor our our our mindfulness no no I don't think that they necessarily are I think that you know uh if something happens you know um you you should take advantage of it and learn something from it and you know so there's uh data not from my lab or yours um but that people who have heart attacks and you live through a heart attack or a stroke all of a sudden you realize gee this is not going to go on you know forever I've got to start living and uh it's a shame I mean I think most people are sealed and unlive lives and um you know that you need a heart attack to wake you up or somebody else's death you know um my uh postto adviser well all three of my advisers died um suicide cancer cancer um so that the joke is you don't want me to work for you but um but in all ser and I was very very close with the the middle one and but the last one as well um and he died of pancreatic pancreatic cancer as it were and um we did multiple fesh thrifts for him celebrations of life right you know there's like in Academia they can't get enough FES thrifts and this you know and and um I'll never forget Ben getting up his uh the celebration of life in front of all the big ups at Stanford and all these people and editors flew in I mean there were like over 200 people there president of Stanford was there and he said you know if I had um if I had known that I was going to be so celebrated and that people were going to be so kind to me I would have you know died a lot earlier you know um that was the first thing he said and the second thing he said is um you know if I could do it over again you know one of these if I could do it over again things he said um I would have never agreed to review so many papers review so many grants and I would have eaten a lot more Sushi and a lot more ice cream and that was it he had a good relationship with death I interviewed him for hours even before I had a podcast uh yeah I don't think people he knew to I don't think it's really death that they're afraid of they're afraid of pain yeah and that um you know and having no control at that moment uh uh the old people I know and studying this for so long I know lots of uh very old people um none of them seem to be afraid of death in fact I ended my counterclockwise book with uh a conversation I was having with um a friend who was 90s something and she said you know Ellen I'm not afraid of dying but living is such fun and I think that that's the way most of us should be um but there's something I wanted to say that uh we touched on before and I don't think um it's not really relevant now but you'll find a way to I'll find a way to make it relevant about spontaneous remissions um you know um I said that with my mother there was a spontaneous remission and the medical world can't study spontaneous remissions or doesn't study so they seem infrequent and uh I think you know that how frequent does something have to be to give people a sense of hope that it's possible you know I don't think it has to be an everyday occurrence of course the more frequent it is the more likely and then you know um but when I think about us spontaneous remissions and I personally think that they're much more common than um the medical world was likely to believe you know once you're in a hospital life is very different from the way um your health is once you're out of the hospital I don't mean that you're sick in one case and not sick in the other but uh the attention that's given to it the uh degree to which Things become self-fulfilling prophecies you know I think that um if you believe that cancer is a killer which is what people used to believe then I think there are many ways that the cancer becomes uh a death sentence um you know that the body learns to well you don't even in a very mundane way if you think you're going to die you don't do those things that keep you alive you know you're not going to go out and get exercise for example if you thought that was good for you I'm going to die anyway the will to live is a very interesting thing um these super agers the people that fall into that Cate I hate I hate that you know I'm I'm sure super memorizers super tasters as soon as we make a group of people the super group that says that whatever they're able to do is not available to everybody else and I don't think that there's any evidence for that yeah well I align with you on that stance I mean um I use the name um only because they're sometimes referenced as as such but uh a focus of the podcast recently has been to emphasize that in that group and others um there's a brain area that's available to everybody because everybody has it which is this anterior mid singulate cortex which is activated when people Embrace new forms of learning and challenges and it does seem to correlate with maintaining cognitive function into later age and it's ROP it's roped into excuse me neurally it is roped into it's linked up with the dopamine reward circuitry and other circuitries in a way that ties it some somewhat to this notion of the will to live being um related to the uh embracing new learnings or at least new challenges you know that there was um uh a story way back when um so there is this um mental facility and people are on what's you their vernacular called the Hopeless Ward and then they wanted to renovate the ward so they move all of the people so you're in the Hopeless W now you're in a hopeful you know without it being called that then the renovation is finished and people are returned to their old rooms and many unexpected deaths occurred this makes me wonder why we have names for hospitals like hospital for sick children yeah I've always I've always been bothered by that title sorry for anyone that's been um treated there and had a great experience because it I imagine it's a great hospital did you read the mindful body I talk about a mindful Hospital which would be different from uh the ground up and now now trying to uh in uh in Mexico um Canada and so and in the states Minnesota uh trying to put up at least start with a mindful emergency Ward and then become a whole mindful Hospital should be very different I mean for the reasons that I'm presuming you're getting that but you know do you know anybody who's ever walked through a hospital door that isn't stressed no I mean no only walking out yeah no but and I believe that stress is by far the major killer it's a very extreme position Andrew I believe I was going to do this work with people in China before covid we take let's say a few hundred people who are just diagnosed with cancer vary the cancer um and we find out how stressed they are and nobody's going to be happy being told they have cancer so we give them a little while it's give them three weeks to adjust to it then we measure this stress level every 3 4 weeks I believe the stress level will predict the course of the disease over and above nutrition genetics and treatment um and stress is psychological which takes me back to how all of this can be controlled um by our minds but anyway so you go to a hospital the first thing you are is stressed uh you have the people working in the hospital especially during Co but it was always the case suffer an enormous amount of burnout well what is burnout you don't get burn out if you're mindful you know if I'm seeing you every day and I'm presuming you're the same Andrew I've seen before your symptoms are basically the same how are you Andrew I take your temperature everything is pretty much the same it can be exhausting because I'm not getting anything if on the other hand I'm noticing all the new things about you then I'm being being fed and um my neurons are firing and I'm not going to burn out we have lots of simple things so when I was talking to aula one day who did some wonderful work on checklists and you know the uh in surgery for instance if they have a checklist there are many fewer errors that are made but uh he had just you know sent the last draft to the Publishers so he wasn't going to be able to change it I said we need a mindful checklist what is a mindful checklist and you remember when we used to travel and you come back to the States and you had to fill out these forms and you're bringing any livestock no do you have any fruits and vegetables you answer three of these and you don't answer any of the other you just know it's no no no all the way down the list so a checklist um and even the checklist and Aviation you know the pilot to uh co-pilot pil flaps up um uh throttle open anti ice off it becomes mindless so remember the plane that um was going from the air Florida flight going from Florida to Washington DC so that's one warm climate to another warm climate and they got flaps up throttle open anti ice off but there was uh snow in DC an unusual event the plane crashed because the deiser was turned off and people were killed and the point of it is that a check a checklist well better than no checklist there's a better than better way we talk a lot about that in in the mindful body that the checklist needs to be a mindful checklist so not um is Andrew in bed yes what position is Andrew in in the bed you know not or and does Andrew have two eyes but you know um how much liquid can you see you know so not yes no going Beyond yes no and the where you can only answer the question if you're actually looking at the person so then you're noticing now wonderful thing about that is if I'm noticing you and being mindful about aspects of you you feel noticed and that's the way you feel cared for and then the relationship grows it keeps coming back to um powers of observation asking questions depth as opposed to speed yeah um these seem to be the the kind of basic Contour yeah yes but it all follows from recognizing you don't know so how do we get people to actually look for the changes in people when I was talking about attention to symptom variability and I said before imagine you're with somebody who is um you think they're losing it they're forgetting now if you think they're forgetting uh you become intolerant every time they forget something because you forgot that it's not willful they really just don't remember number one number two the only time you're paying attention is when they're forgetting so you've not attended to all the times they're remembering so the uh the problem seems worse but if you were in fact attending to when are they misremembering what are the circumstances you and you catch it early you say that the person doesn't forget everything they forget I don't know uh questions about restaurants for example well then you know probably they don't care I'm going to be happy I'm an eater I'm going to be happy wherever we go and so unless we're going to someplace that's phenomenally expensive or we have to travel a great you know whether we went to restaurant a b or c I might not remember for you since you're very Discerning you know you're going to know you had a wonderful meal here and a horrible meal in the other three places so for you it matters the point is when somebody doesn't know why don't they know and if you immediately assume it's because of dementia you have a catchall and are missing all of the subtleties that in fact would lead to different diagnosis and so if the this you know the same thing in the um the nurse or doctor attending to the patient if they're attending to the changes and asking themselves why the smaller changes and the things that are not changing uh I had a student uh many years ago who had um Ms and when somebody would ask her how she is she's great you know and then one person then said but how could you be gracious my arms work my head is working you know and went through all the parts of her um that are not suffering you know so you can always attend to what's wrong you can't attend to everything you know playing tennis you could attend to the wonderful shots you made you can attend to the false um you know uh and that's going to lead to very different states right if I attend to every time I I hit that ball in a way I didn't think I could hit I'm going to learn something from it and be motivated to try it again if I attend to every time I screwed up I'm going to you know be embarrassed I'm going to be afraid to um to expand uh and experience new things um I feel like um I've just combined 12 different areas here masterfully and masterfully masterfully and what I realize is that we're always to some extent in Choice as they say and I think to some people that will feel freeing like you know I'm always in choice I can my House burn down well you know who knows what newness that will bring these kinds of things um but to some people only if they believe that there's a right answer if you don't believe there's a right answer if you believe there's a right answer you want someone give me that answer which surgery should I have oh my God I'm supposed to have a house the house burned you know life is over but if you realize that any experience is only experience through you um and um provides opportunities I can certainly adopt that I I also can feel the parts of me that I assume are what other people experience as well which is that when one has so many uh degrees of freedom over how to respond that itself can feel a bit overwhelming of course you know so when Eric FR wrote escape from Freedom it was that same idea that you can be paralyzed by so many choices but I think that's wrong I think you're only Paralyzed by the choices if implicitly you believe there's a right and a wrong choice and when you recognize that they're all equal it just doesn't matter it's easy to choose then so it's Choose Your Own Adventure exactly yeah and then or make whatever you're doing in adventure you know if I can't be near the one I love I should love the one I'm near at one time that was considered uh okay nowadays well nowadays there are a couple things that are more complicated I would I would argue one earlier you mentioned codling of people that are you know uh aged elderly I hate that word now that I'm 77 well you are no one would guess that you're uh that you're 77 and um yeah your Your vitality is undeniable this notion of coddling you know Jonathan height wrote the coddling of of the American mind anxious generation I have to wonder what it's like for kids growing up nowadays and teenagers constantly being told about this disorder and that disorder and um and the idea that you know if you meet five out of 10 of the the you know menu of criteria that you are you might even be this thing you are blank as opposed to just having blank or struggling with everything is yeah yeah and um we certainly over uh prescribe medication in this country uh compar certainly compared to other countries you know the vast amount of anti-depressant and anti medication is consumed in the United States um and certainly those medications can be valuable for people uh I would argue um but they are over prescribed I would also argue so my question is if one grows up being told that they are fragile that um there's threat everywhere or even that there's threat everywhere on social media let's just like push into that um into that dent a little bit too because that's um uh Jonathan's idea uh you know sitting here talking to you that now has me thinking well maybe my 18-year-old niece is perfectly capable of navigating this online uh landscape and it's just me who's not capable of it and so I'm going to decide that she's that it's that she's struggling but maybe kids aren't getting enough physical activity one could argue but um on the basis of of data but do you see where I'm going here when when one can kind of pivot to different lenses to look at something through it it increases the the number of options but then at some point we have to decide are we codling our kids too much or are we or are we not coddling them too much um it reminds me of an argument um back I guess when I was your age and the question was um uh violence on TV and we're kids being exposed to this violence becoming more violent and I never quite understood it because um if you were my child and we were sitting there watching this violence I go oh and you would see that my reaction to it was negative and you'd learn um not to engage in that or to recognize you know on the effects on other people what I'm saying is that you know rather than the medium being the message um the medium you know people say to me is technology good technology isn't anything the tools and if they're used mindfully they're good if they're used mindlessly you know they're not good um and so um I I think it's silly I you know there's data showing that kids who are um uh college kids for example who use a lot of social media have lower self-esteem and all of you know and I present this to them and I say this is silly you're not now going to get off Facebook because of these data but let's look at it you're Harvard students for God's sakes why is it that you're only going to post the picture where you look the prettiest talk about the you know have the nerve to turn it around hey would you believe what I look like last night you know when you're having that bad hair day or something didn't go well just have the guts to do that so it's not the social media it's the lying that you know uh or the mistaken assumption when you see um all of the the successes that that's the the more General truth everybody but you is having these successes um well certain yeah certainly um social media gives it a literal score for followers and likes and and things of that sort so it's thumbs up thumbs down I mean literally scoring performance in terms of what other people think it's certainly training those circuits um very robustly whereas but if people learn the three levels that I was explaining before um then you'd see that what looks like is not good in fact maybe quite something you know you have um people who are poor and uh they can't spend a lot of money on their appearance and then you have everybody else is spending a lot of money on their appearance they have some of these very very rich people who you know I had this um editor uh for mindfulness wonderful woman um she's recently dead died and um the first time we went out um this is when you know I was young and it was wonderful how they're going to send me all these free books and they take me out all time to get me to publish with this company as supposed to that company and I'll never forget this we go for this meal and she looked poor so I I didn't eat anything you know I chose the cheapest thing on the menu because I knew she was paying I found out she was one of the richest people in New England you know uh so that's the the level three where you have so much you hide it and you know well this is interesting because you know when I was growing up unless people had money to purchase things they would drive older cars and things like that um with credit that changed yeah um and I have friends who like to wear very very fancy watches I also have friends who um have far more money than them and uh choose to wear no watch so it's it's getting harder to discern um except at the extremes of course it's getting harder to discern who has what and and maybe that's a good thing again at the extremes it's obvious you know that the homeless issue in in Los Angeles and everywhere in California is so it's so troubling and so sad um what what's happening but setting that aside I think nowadays we have less information about people's values even just by looking at them when I was growing up as somebody wore a particular T-shirt with a particular band you kind of knew if you were part of the same group all of that's gone now it's all leveled and um but people could be asked at any stage why is somebody you know dressed this way why is somebody doing what they're doing and when asked now you're only given a single answer when you're given multiple answers you see the three levels you know they're doing it for this wonderful reason for this awful reason it has this meaning and that meaning and that's what you want things to be obscured you don't want to be pigeon hold um because if you think you know what I'm going to say because of this belief of who I am you're not going to listen to me and then we're not going to have a conversation that's going to be interesting and um that's a waste I know that you're not a fan of particular activities as a way to increase longevity or particular activities as a way to increase mindfulness but could we say that having somewhat of a mindset of playfulness with ideas and and one's environment could um potentiate longevity so my I have these lyrics in the books a friend of mind Zoe Lewis wonderful Entertainer and she sings a song that I just love you're never too old to be young um and um sure I think that one should be playful to be playful now a side effect of that is I think you'll be happier and healthier and if you're happier and healthier I think you'll live longer but the reason to do it the problem with most people now is that everything they're doing is for some other reason I'm taking this medication so that eventually I'm going to the gym so that eventually um I think who knows what's going to happen eventually I feel lucky that enjoy exercise and always have but if I didn't I don't know um you get yourself yeah I don't like exercise that's exercise you know so I was telling somebody the story actually uh just yesterday so I was visiting friends many many years ago in buau beach and they said in the morning let's go to Captain Jack I'm thinking Captain Jack is going to be breakfast and I'm thinking I'm going to have a big breakfast why not we take a long walk to get there and you know I'm very excited so we get down to the beach and we're walking to Captain Jack and then there's this stick in the sand that says on it Captain Jack all it is was the end point to our walk you know well for me uh if I had known the walk was just for the walk I probably would have enjoyed it much less you know that um if I'm in Paris and shopping Window Shop you I walk you know 10 miles a day and enjoy myself thoroughly but if you said let's go for a walk of even five miles and it's just to walk now this is Mindless I'm not suggesting this is a good thing but um you know uh activities that are meant to be fun and that are easy to engage in are fun um are uh will be good for you and if you see it as exercise if you're doing it for some other reason um it's a shame because even the exercise for exercise sake should me I won't do it if it isn't fun I don't know if that's a privilege position but um now that's not that you know I say I won't do it if it isn't fun I think that this is something that I do well is to make and almost anything be fun well that's a great skill I was talking to my mom last night and she was um saying you know not much is happening here and I kept saying no like tell me what are you guys up to had been a while and she said well I don't have this like big exciting life you know and I said what what what's going on and she said okay well if you really want to know there's this new Plant weed that's growing in the garden and she started explaining to me this really interesting weed that has these little yellow flowers and my mom loves gardening and so she Delights in gardening and I was delighting in her delight and when she was done I said that's actually the kind of thing I'd love to talk about you know and hear more about because I I also know my own experience so I didn't need to talk about like what's going on on the podcast or what's going on in my daily life or the incredible breeds of dogs that I'm considering getting maybe all of them um because I was interested in what was going on in her garden and so what was trivial to her was actually interesting to me and it represented a a really good bridge to a number of things I have to say that um we were talking earlier about how one frames past present and future I don't know if we were talking about it in that way but in think about age longevity um and what's possible the word that came to mind that I'd like to just pressure test a little bit is uh Nostalgia and I have this feeling and I hope I'm wrong because I've been wrong about most things today in a way that I'm learning from it uh that Nostalgia can be perhaps kind of a dangerous line of thinking this idea that things used to be great oh yeah but now they're not why can't they be like why can't they what a and I thought to myself what a Terri question School reunions and I thought well no If all we're going to do is uh you know uh Embrace Nostalgia yes if it makes us feel like we're 19 again exactly um this kind of thing and and here you can substitute reunions with should I look at photo albums yeah like like I I don't know how I feel about photos from the past I used to collect them and and and and cherish them and now sometimes when I look at them it just makes me long for something and I'm trying I think I need to learn how to Pivot through that so what what's your what are your thoughts on Nostalgia and just Notions of how we think about our past in general well they're I don't think they're very different from what you've already covered um in that fire I lost all the photos and um it didn't occur to me that I had lost all of them for years because um I didn't look at them here you know so could help a lot a lot of that so it's very true um I think um you know when I was young some of my friends uh um were keeping a diary and I never kept a diary and so then my feeling was I'd rather just be living than recording but it depends on how you record it if you're reliving it while you're recording it then you're living it's the same thing you know one activity is really no better than another if you're doing it mindfully now this is hard for people to accept and if I say to you that if you're cleaning a toilet that the distinctions you're drawing are no better or worse than if you're um trying to come up with a theory of relativity or understand Einstein's theory of relativity a distinction is a distinction is a distinction um and so that's why these little little things that you're noticing your mother's weed um is no less important although she thought you might see it as less important than you're having just INF in you know uh interviewed somebody that she thought was phenomenal um once you notice you notice and that's the whole ball game and there's always something to notice and if you're noticing it um without the stress overlay that some people add to their lives which I can't understand um it's no different from a game you know I I use this example and I think that my students must think I'm crazy um and I so if I believe that I should come up with a different example but you you're flossing your teeth now you can floss your teeth mindlessly in which case you resent being there you're spending the time because you're you're thinking that it's good for you but you'd rather be doing something else you're uh not there you're flossing but your mind is thinking about um a party you're going to go to for example to me make it fun it so easy I mean you play little games like can I predict how much junk is going to come out as a you know and and which teeth which part you know everything can be made into a game um I had this you can maybe figure out how to bring this product to Market but um it was called I I have so many of these it's called Wego a way of training your child to use the toilet and so it it's not very hard uh we'd sell you could sell them these little vials of chemicals that when you add it a few drops to urine it changes color but so each of these vials will change the color uh to a different color adults would buy that yeah and the kid is you know has to guess either to the parent or just for themselves you know is this going to be yellow green blue you know what it becomes fun um gamifying um things is one of the the great pleasures of parenting yeah you know and earlier you were talking about what what are your grand uh grandkids call you you're the uh Cosmic leader Cosmic leader like you can play these games with them um that and then they reach their uh adolescent in teen years and they then they they claim they don't like those games but as the as a former child and then teen now I Delight in some of the games that my parents played with me when I was little because it brings me back to the Notions of of of imagination yeah no um I think that uh one of the worst things that the world uh teaches us is that we have work and we have play as if these are two distinct categories in fact I think if you were to ask somebody just one question to determine how mindful they are it might be how much do you need a vacation I've I mean I've never taken one so yeah no you know but need and want to two different things and if I really need a vacation that means my working is being done mindlessly L and that's a shame um you know if you can't find a way to do it so you enjoy it go someplace else it's not worth the price you're paying um and for people that say well that's a luxury I need to work in order to survive and and feed my family Etc how does one reconcile that um well then learn how to make it fun you know that um anything can be made fun just you make it a game you try to figure out guess what's going to happen see the you know can you do it differently from the last time can you do it with your eyes closed I mean you know it's fun you know get down on not related to your work but you get down on all fours and see the world that your cat or your dog sees um you know close the lights and see what it's like being blind um try to get through the day without hearing I I I wanted to do this thing 50 years ago which was to create a a building that simulated um old age and so if you took the 50-year-old and they spent even a short time in that building where um it's colder than usual because there's less oxygen in your blood you feel theis Vision Narrows you um that they would expand each of their abilities um at a time that it's easy but the problem with that was a 50-year-old doesn't want to imagine being 80 years old you've done some studies on healing and time perception could you just describe that experiment I love this paper I love this experiment so much Peter and I did this my graduate student um we inflict a wound now it would have been more dramatic if we could really cut you up but we're not satus and even if we were the review committees wouldn't let us do it so it's a minor wound but it's still a wound and we have people individually sitting in front of a clock unbeknownst to them for a third of the people the clock is going twice as fast as real time for another third of the people it's going half as fast as real time and for the last third it's going real time and the question is most people would assume that wound's going to heal how that wound heals has nothing to do with the perception of time but it turns out that it healed based on clock time now when you add that to some of the things that we've already said um you end up with a very different picture and you broke her arm and you asked the doctor how long is it going to take to heal how does he know or she know I mean it's a ridiculous question lots of people have broken arms you know even if this were somebody who studied broken arms and he stopped studying yesterday today there are new people with broken arms that might have different rates of healing but people give an answer and depending on the way the doctor gives that answer I think is important the doctor says it's going to take you and I'm making this I don't know how long it take it's going to take you a month you organize yourself in such a way that it's going to take a month but I think if the doctor instead which is what I would recommend said we really don't know some people heal faster than others the fastest healing time that I personally know of is you know let's say two weeks um you know and you know if you can heal faster than that or that been good for you and if not you know um it's fine also because there are advantages to not healing that people don't realize you know if you broken your right arm uh and it's taking a long time to heal that means you're using your left arm and if you're using your left arm you're exercising the right side of your brain uh which is going to be good for many tests um I don't know how we ended up right-handed or left-handed I'm are you ambidextrous I'm right-handed um I I'll occasionally uh go into hook righty but I'm I'm I'm a righty my dad was naturally left-handed they forced him to be right-handed oh interesting because I'm sort of ambid exress mostly rightand but people don't realize that if you're using your right hand it's controlled by the left part of your brain your left hand the right part of your brain and wouldn't it be nice to exercise both parts of our brain and so we're doing research where we get people and this is really interesting because not just using so this work with was begun gosh I can't tell you how many years ago and for one reason or another never got finished initially it was just getting people to use their wrer of a left hand now it's more sophisticated where it's using your left hand with an awareness that you're using it or not and I think that the effect on the brain will only obtain if you're aware oh this fits so beautifully I don't want to um spend too much time on this but I'm and you're probably aware of these experiments but just for sake of our listeners um that you probably know that your colleagues at at Harvard uh David hu and and Toren of visel won the Nobel Prize for brain plasticity critical periods of vision Etc and they had this sort of doctrine that um they stated in the 80s and it lasted until the gosh until the early and mid 2000s that there was no significant brain plasticity in adult humans that it literally shut down Mike merenik and a guy named Greg recken Z at UCSF did these beautiful studies I'll try and describe this really quickly but um where they would have their subjects pay attention to uh little um uh bumps on a rotating drum of different coarseness or finess and then there was a tone playing in the room and if they were told to discriminate uh when the the bumps were changed from course to just slightly less course or more course they they the subject would signal okay that happened and then over time the the area of the brain response for touch in in adults expanded the the the the map of that so adult plasticity what was very interesting however is if they did the exact same thing but they were told to attend to slight changes in the frequency of the tone it didn't matter what they were doing with their fingers the auditory cortex changed and the and the somata sensory the touch uh map didn't and so it's proof positive that it's not just a behavior in adulthood but the combination behavior and awareness of what of the shift in in perception that drives adult plasticity um and I find those studies to be well first of all they aren't discussed enough um that that feature isn't discussed enough and second of all it basically says that awareness is the gate to Brain Change sure and I and I think that fits perfectly with everything that you've been talking about yeah I don't see how it could be otherwise actually yeah but you know to go back to the doctor telling you how long it's going to heal it tends to be now a self-fulfilling prophecy so given that doctors have this influence over us they need to be more responsible in the information they're given and we we can't know how long it's going to take to heal um people today are different from people 20 years ago they ate different things the activities were different the air was different and so on and so from where are these Norms derived in fact whenever I speak to anybody I get lots of calls from people who were given these dread diagnosis and you know the first thing I tell them is you know it takes so long to do these studies and then it takes forever to analyze the data and then it takes another forever to publish it and then eventually when you're going to hear about it it's already old news you know so the reason the information you're reading now was true for people who lived you know 10 years ago 10 years is a lot a lot of things happening and always with the intention of getting people uh to be less uh absolute in their understanding of any of this so that they can imagine all sorts of possibilities but you know even the thing that I just said a moment before that it's important for people to realize the advantage in using their um you know their left hand if they're right-handed or their right hand if they're left-handed and then at the same time recognizing that when they break a leg um when somebody breaks a leg that forces you to do everything differently and if you attend to that that can be a wonderful thing you know I I I don't know how I got to see these things or it's very strange to me when I think of what things have influenced me I don't know how old I was Andrew but I'm watching this thing on television and there's this woman who has no arms who's got a knife between her toes who's slicing a tomato and you know it's a lot of years you I've seen and done a lot of things but for me to remember that and that um you know even when we're taught to do something we're taught a single way it's so much more fun to be taught multiple ways I mean when I you know hurt my right arm I'm playing tennis poorly but I'm still playing with my left hand um we have such a deficit model of life and this also fits with the conoman stuff right that you know people will work much harder to avoid a loss than they will for a gain and it seems to be see now that's interesting because when I go to teach that I have so much trouble keeping track of what's the loss and what's the gain because I don't see the world that way you've transcend you've transcended the typical notion whether I've transcended or not I just think differently and but everybody accepts that and to see the gain in the so-called loss or the loss in the so-called gain um you know you just end up with a very different world you know well I'm not as involved in that aspect um certainly others as well as you are but when I started my lab I used to teach my students something which was okay we're going to get a lot more rejections and have to do a lot more revisions than we are going to get acceptances on papers and grants so the best thing that you can do which is what I had to do for myself one of the best things you might consider would have been a gentler way to say but I said one of the best things can do cuz that's the way I talk sometimes is to create a long Arc of um positive feedback loops when something good happens but that when something negative happens let yourself feel it acutely and then move on Fast and like so if I were to plot this it would it would basically be like an accepted paper will Delight me and motivate me for many many months if not years but a a rejection or or a tough revision where it's where looking at another year or two of experiments it was I'd allow myself maybe a day and a half of just being you know utterly crushed and then right back to it yeah but another way you know when I say put people back in the equation that's what you need to teach them which is the responses you're getting these reviews are not from a bunch of sages in the sky all KN people they're just a group of people a group of people with different biases and so on um and um you know it doesn't mean you were wrong yeah and reviews I learned from my postto adviser and I love this is he he us to say reviews always make papers better even if you hate them they always make papers better they never make papers worse sometimes they make papers a little bit harder to track because like there's this weird figure put in just to satisfy a reviewer kind like what is this but everyone eventually realized what that figure is about anyway um and so I I adopted the idea that reviews red ink critical feedback are just way of getting better which has also been essential in the podcasting sphere CU if I've ever gotten anything wrong believe me I hear about it in the comments and sometimes it can be embarrassing but it's you just look at it as an opportunity to address your humanness and move forward you know correct it and move forward but I think a lot of people try and maintain this ER of perfection like there's some sort of fabri egg that instead of living life like a work of art where it has dimples and cracks and acne and and all the rest and it's human I think a lot of people um want to present themselves to the world like a Fab egg like that's just absolutely but the problem with that is going out the next day you can be that fa ache on day one but now you've got to maintain that I mean the first paper that I published um came back without a comment without a comment not a correction not a typo what a dangerous thing to happen exactly it was awful yeah that was not my experience well set me up for you know expectations what do you mean when for the next one um but I think also that it's um once you recognize that uh this is an opinion rather than a statement of fact you know and then when you uh what I tell my students is that when you get a comment it doesn't mean that the comment is right it means that whatever you wrote wasn't appreciated in the way you wanted it to be appreciated and they're guessing at well if you did it this way rather than that way um you know papers that are not accepted today may be accepted tomorrow the same paper I mean I you know I I can't tell you how many times people say can't be and then it becomes the standard you know um you mean in terms of a field and what's what's acceptable yeah yeah things have certainly changed and look you you've done a tremendous amount to pioner that change I mean I it's not one study or 10 study or 20 studies I mean there's now a catalog of incredibly groundbreaking work that you've um I don't know if you used intentionally or you just following your interests but that have transformed the way that we think about the mind and its role in our physiology and so on I I was hoping to get your Reflections on something that I sometimes say that's probably wrong but that is helpful to me because and hopefully to other people too um because it I think capture some of the circuit Dynamics related to reward and reinforcement and it sometimes resurfaces on the internet that addiction among other things is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure and I used to attached to that statement you know Enlightenment if there is such a thing is a progressive broadening of the things that bring us pleasure and one thing that struck me throughout today's conversation is that it seems like you're able to look at pretty much anything through a bunch of different facets take on other points of view so strong theory of mind while holding on to your own perceptions right right you're not you're not you're not drifting off from yourself you're you're remaining you know of of self and but taking on other perspectives and um and that flexibility of thinking and that expansiveness like looking at things as good bad maybe I don't know I don't know what's true what could be true and really challenging preconceived notions um it seems very powerful do you believe in Enlightenment and was the description I just gave anything like what no I'm very flattered um you know I think that when you're walking around and you don't see and all of a sudden you see you you can say that you're enlightened um I I guess in a not so grandiose way that that simple thing that I keep saying recognizing that behavior makes sense leads you to such a different View of people you don't have people who are good and bad people who are addicted and not addicted you know um you don't have a students and and uh failing students everything just organizes itself differently and you come to appreciate the individual talents that people have um and when you can do that I don't know if you want to call the person enlightened but life just um is easier um and and nicer you know it's nicer to walk outside and be trusting of people and um not to be afraid of this bastard or that one who's going to come and get you I mean I went to with a friend this was so many years ago to an AA meeting to see what it was like and um I had left my pocketbook over here wherever that is you can see and we walked over here and for whatever reason and I said I left my pocketbook over there and then I thought you know so was if somebody takes it they probably need it more than I do and it was so freeing um you know just not to care about all these things that somehow we're implicitly sometimes explicitly taught to care about and always evaluating ourselves um you know that that little song uh feeling that let me sing I enjoy S I can't carry a tune so what um why should somebody make me feel bad about singing and maybe I'll become a better singer or maybe I'll sing in some way that'll teach somebody you know some new trick that they hadn't thought about before because of my uh inadequacy why why are people evaluating themselves at every moment um rather than feeling good about the things they know that they can do and who decides what's important to be able to do I don't know how to most articulately share it but it's just a very different life you know a life where you don't I just don't believe that stress is necessary um I don't believe that uh there's anybody in this world that's better than I am but I also don't believe I'm better than anybody else it's very different where everything especially among uh you know those of us who are academics where every minute you're given a grade and even you know the number of papers you got accepted you know determines your pecking order and so on it's all so silly you know and then you have the money people and I have2 billion dollar you know so I'm better off than people I'm a better person than people have 10 billion dollars um it's sad to me when in fact I think all of it is engaged in order to feel good about yourself that's all you know why do I need that money why do I need those A's why do I need those successes so that I'll like myself just like yourself recognize that you're likable why not um that may seem simple-minded but it's gotten me to wherever I am it has indeed and it's helped a tremendous number of people both uh in the form of scientific findings which are then uh shared with people through books and through podcasts and I'm just so grateful that you came here today to share with us this is really uh as vast as it's been um you know just a subset of the of the discoveries that you've made so you know a couple of things um first of all thank you for coming here today it's been my pleasure I I've thoroughly enjoyed this and uh I love love love your work and it's caused me to think differently about things and today's discussion is going to make me and I know know so many other people think differently about everything I mean very very few discussions that I'll hold uh will make me rethink my thinking about everything this one certainly will um and and also for continuing to do the work that you're doing I mean it's uh it's clear that you embody and live the the discoveries that you make and and it's not just uh an academic Pursuit that then you know allows you to collect all the appropriately collect all the amazing Awards and um and titles but that it really serves and and that you live it so thank you for that as well and then um two more questions um very briefly the first one is uh would doesn't matter how long the question is it's the answer that matters right so you ask me the brief question the floor is yours but uh would you consider coming back um again to share with us uh some additional findings is the second to last question and then I'm just thinking that um maybe the last question is uh so that it sticks in people's minds um would you be willing to share the [Laughter] song Oh Andrew all right yes I'm going to sing this now you have to remember though that I'm singing this because I think singing is fun and it shouldn't matter how good a voice you have okay so here we go this is to the old um Sarah Lee commercial and everybody doesn't like something but nobody doesn't like Sarah Le right everybody doesn't know something but everyone knows something else everyone can't do something but everyone can do something else so what have I lost by singing that I know I can sing now you know I can sing but do you think my not being able to sing means I can't write think or do whatever it is that I do better than singing no of course not I love the song and thanks for saying you'll come back again thank you so much thanks for having me thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr Ellen Langer I hope you found it to be as fascinating as I did to learn

Title: Use the “MIQ Process” to Excel in Any Endeavor
Published: 2025-02-02 23:29:26 UTC
Description:
Chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin developed a process to achieve peak performance in any craft or career. He has applied it to investing, professional sports, science, and more. The MIQ Process, or Most Important Question process, is not a quick fix but rather a rewiring of your default settings.

A key aspect of this process is creating space in the stimulus-response dimensions of life—not filling every moment with input. Instead, you seed your mind with critical questions and allow space to capture the answers. This applies to career, relationships, or any other important aspect of life.

We cannot deny the power of the unconscious mind to solve the problems we consciously feed it. Solid science supports this. Josh has achieved immense success in chess, martial arts, and business. His work coaching individuals across disparate careers further underscores the value of this approach.

Transcript Language: English
For many, many years, decades, I've been practicing what I call now the MIQ process. Most important question process. And the essence of it is, it's what I came to as the most potent way so far that I've found to train analysts or thinkers in mental arenas. You're training people in the art of discovering what matters most. If you talk to like a great chess player, actually looks at less than a lower level chess player, but they look at the right direction. So you might think a great chess player, people often think like, oh yeah, I can calculate 50 moves deep, 100 moves deep, it's all irrelevant. Move two was inaccurate, so it was just all an illusion. The great chess players might look at much less, but they're looking in the most potent directions. The lower level chess players are lost in a sea of complexity, right? So if you're working with like a, let's say, a scientist or an investor or whatever, them straining their mind for what is the most important question, ideally to begin the practice toward the end of their workday with like release, a recovery period, with full intensity in a peak performance state, stretch one's mind for what matters most. And then release it, release the workday completely, don't work all night grinding yourself out at a low level, release and then first thing in the morning, waking up, pre-input, return one's mind to the critical question and brainstorm on it. It's very powerful because you're systematically opening the channel between the conscious and the unconscious mind. You're feeding critical questions to the unconscious, which it's processing overnight. And like I know, you know all this, like the consistency with which you come up with an insight in the morning is incredible. Interestingly, and you'll probably know why much more than me, improved dream recall often happens simultaneously when one starts to have more and more insights about the MIQ in the morning, which is fascinating. And then over time you can have micro manifestation of this throughout the day before going for a workout, before taking a walk, before taking a break, before taking a piss, instead of going, when you're going to go to the bathroom in the day, instead of like checking your phone while taking a piss, you pose yourself an MIQ, you release it, you do not do anything but piss in the bathroom and breathe and then return to the question and you'll have an insight. Right, so you're learning to just oscillate between the conscious and unconscious states an you're opening up that channel. And you're practicing stress and recovery. And then your physiological workouts are also stress and recovery all the time. So you're building that theme in everything that you do and you realize that like when you're at your very best for four or five hours a day, you're doing multiples of the work that you're doing if you're just grinding yourself at, you know, what I've called in the past, a simmering six or whatever, at, you know, for 15 or 16 hours a day.

Title: How to Increase Motivation & Drive | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2025-01-30 13:00:34 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the biological mechanism behind motivation and drive, as well as discuss practical tools for overcoming procrastination. 

I discuss the key role dopamine plays in driving cravings and motivating action. I explain how dopamine regulates the balance between pleasure and pain, and what happens when this system becomes dysregulated, leading to addiction. I discuss the role of molecules like serotonin, which help enhance the enjoyment of the present, and explain how to balance the drive for more while staying focused in the present. I also discuss the causes of procrastination and describe strategies to boost dopamine levels through behavioral approaches or supplements. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

welcome to huberman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we're going to talk about an extremely important topic that's Central to our daily life and that's motivation we're going to talk about pleasure and reward what underlies our sense of pleasure or reward we're going to talk about addictions as well we're going to talk about the neurochemistry of drive and mindset but for now let's just talk about the Neuroscience of motivation and reward of Pleasure and Pain because those are Central to what we think of as emotions whether or not we feel good whether or not we feel we're on track in life whether or not we feel we're falling behind so motivation is fundamental to our daily life it's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning it's what allows us to pursue longterm goals or short-term goals motivation and the chemistry of motivation is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement in fact the same single molecule dopamine is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement it's a fascinating molecule and it lies at the center of so many great things in life and it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects of Life namely addiction and certain forms of mental disease so if ever there was a double-edged blade in the world of Neuroscience it's dopamine there's a fundamental relationship between dopamine released in your brain and your desire to exert effort and you can actually control the schedule of dopamine release but it requires the appropriate knowledge this is one of those cases where understanding the way the dopamine system works will allow you to leverage it to your benefit let's get a few basic facts on the table dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s and it was discovered as the precursor meaning the thing from which epinephrine or adrenaline is made epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline except in the brain we call it epinephrine epinephrine allows us to get into action it stimulates changes in the blood vessels in the heart in the organs and tissues of the body that bias us for movement dopamine was initially thought to be just the building block for epinephrine however dopamine does a lot of things on its own it's not always converted to epinephrine dopamine is released from several sites in the brain and body but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion about motivation and reward is something that sometimes just called the reward pathway for the afficianados it's sometimes called the misol limic reward pathway but it's fundamentally important to your desire to engage in action and it's fundamentally important for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors so how does this work well you've got a structure in the Deep part of your brain called the VTA the VTA or vental tegmental area contains neurons that send what we call axons little wires that spit out dopamine at a different structure called the nucleus accumbent and those two structures VTA and nucleus accumbent form really the core Machinery of the reward pathway and the pathway that controls your motivation for anything you can think of them like an accelerator they bias you for Action however within the reward pathway there's also a break the break or restriction on that dopamine which controls when it's released and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex the prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate right behind your forehead you hear about it for decisionmaking executive function for planning Etc and indeed it's responsible for a lot of those it's this really unique real estate that we were all endowed with as humans other animals don't have much of it we have a lot of it and that prefrontal cortex acts as a break on the dopamine system and that brings us to the important feature of motivation which is that motivation is a two-part process which is about balancing Pleasure and Pain so when you're just sitting around not doing much of anything this reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a rate of about three or four times per second it's kind of firing in a low level if suddenly you get excited about something you anticipate something not receive an award but you get excited in an anticipatory way then the rate of firing the rate of activity in this reward pathway suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times and it has the effect of creating a sense of action or desire to move in the direction of the thing that you're craving in fact it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible for wanting and for craving and that's distinctly different from the way that you hear it talked about normally which is that it's involved in pleasure so yes dopamine is released in response to sex it's released in response to food it's released in response to a lot of things but it's mostly released in anticipation and craving for a particular thing it has the effect of narrowing our Focus for the thing that We crave and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee it could be as um important as a big board meeting it could be a big final exam it could be uh the person that we're excited to meet or see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving it just releases at a particular rate if we just take a step back and we look at the scientific data on how much the dopamine firing increases in response to different things you get a pretty interesting window into how your brain works and why you might be motivated or not motivated let's say you're hungry or you're looking forward to a cup of coffee or you're going to see your partner well well your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate until you start thinking about the thing that you want or the thing that you're looking forward to when you eat that food the amount of dopamine that's released in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above Baseline sex which is fundamental to our species continuation and reproduction sex does release dopamine and it increases dopamine levels about 100% so basically doubles them Nic increases the amount of dopamine about 150% above Baseline cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine that's released a thousandfold within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug however just thinking about food about sex about nicotine if you like nicotine or cocaine or amphetamine can increase the amount of dopamine that's released to the same degree as actually consuming the drug now it depends in some cases for instance the cocaine user the addict that wants cocaine can't just think about cocaine and increase the amount of that's released about a thousandfold it's actually much lower but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track for to Crave that particular thing now there are reasons why you would have brain circuitry like this I mean brain circuitry like this didn't evolve to get you addicted brain circuitry like this evolved in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals water when you're thirsty sex and in order to reproduce these things and these brain areas and neurons were part of the evolutionary history that led to the continuation of our species things like cocaine and amphetamine are disastrous for most people because they release so much dopamine and they create these closed Loops where people then only crave the particular thing cocaine amphetamine that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release most things don't release that that level of dopamine now nowadays there's a ton of Interest in social media and in video games and it there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine released video games especially video games that have a very high update speed where there's novel territory all the time novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine those can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine so very high levels of dopamine release social media is an interesting one because the amount of dopamine that's released in response to logging onto social media initi could be quite high but it seems like likely that there's a taper in the amount of dopamine but and yet people still get addicted so why why is it that we can get addicted to things that fail to get to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure that they initially did being addicted to something isn't just about the fact that it feels so good that you want to do it over and over again and that's because of this pleasure pain balance that underlies motivation so let's look a little bit closer at the pleasure pain balance because therein lies the tools for you to be able to control motivation toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors towards things that are destructive for you there are a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors whether not those are drugs or whether not those are Adventure thrill-seeking things or you know they take a new class as you'll notice I'm not placing any judgment or value on these different behaviors although I think it's fair to point out that for most people addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamine are very destructive actually we know that about 15 to 20% of people have a genetic bias towards addiction that you know you sometimes hear that the first time that you use a drug you can become addicted to it that's actually not been shown to be true for most things and most people but for some people that actually is true but in any case the way that addiction works and the way that motivation Works generally in the non-addictive setting is that when you anticipate something a little bit of dopamine is released and then when you reach that thing you engage in that thing the amount of dopamine goes up even further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing let's say you love running or you love chocolate as you eat a piece of chocolate believe it or not it tastes good and then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine and there are other chemicals that are released that trigger a low-level sense of pain now you you might not feel it as physical pain but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part the mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet another piece of chocolate and this is a very important and subtle feature of the dopamine system that's not often discussed people always talk about just as pleasure you love social media so it gives you dopamine and so you engage in that you like chocolate it releases dopamine so you do that but for every bit of dopamine that's released there's another circuit in the brain that creates you can think of it as kind of like a downward deflection in pleasure so you engage in something you really want and there's an increase in pleasure and then there's a without you doing anything there's a mirror image of that which is a downward deflection and pleasure which we're calling pain so for every bit of pleasure there is a mirror image experience of pain and they overlap in time very closely so it's sometimes hard to sense this but try it the next time you eat something really delicious you'll take a bite it tastes delicious and part of experience is to want more of that thing this is true for any pleasureful experience now the Diabolical part about dopamine is that because it didn't evolve in order to get you to indulge in more and more and more of something what happens is that initially you experience an in an increase in pleasure and you also experience this increase in pain shortly after or woven in with the pleasure that makes you want more of that thing but with each subsequent time that you encounter that thing the experience of dopamine release and pleasure is diminished a little bit and the Diabolical thing is that the pain response is increased a little bit and this is best observed in the context of drug-seeking behavior the first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine they will experience a huge dopamine release and they will feel likely very good however the next time they take it it won't feel quite as good and it won't feel even as good the third time or the next time but the amount of pain the amount of craving that they experience for the drug will increase over time so much of our pursuit of pleasure is simply to reduce the pain of craving so the next time you experience something you really like I don't want to take you out of that experience but it's really important that you notice this that if there's something you really enjoy part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing and that's the pain system in action and so we can distinguish between dopamine which is really about pleasure and dopamine which is really about motivation to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain let me repeat that dopamine isn't as much about pleasure as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more in order to reduce the amount of pain and we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain and a craving although people that Miss a lover very badly or that really crave a food very badly or that are addicted to a drug and can't access it will experience that as a physical craving and a mental craving the body and brain are linked in this way it's almost they'll describe it as painful they yearn for it and I think the word yearning is one that's very valuable in this context because yearning seems to include a whole body experience more than just wanting which could just be up in the mind mind so your desire for something is proportional to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing but also how much pain you experience when you don't have it and you can now start to let your mind wander into all sorts of examples of addictions or things that you happen to like um I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here which is my love of croissants the taste of that croissant makes me want to eat more croissant now eventually blood sugar goes up satiety is reached Etc what happens then what is s isfaction and satiety about well that's a separate neuromodulator that's about the neuromodulator serotonin it's about oxytocin it's about a hormone system that involves something called prolactin so we're going to talk about all all of those in the book The molecule of more wonderful book uh those were described as the Here and Now molecules the ones that allow you to experience your Sensations and pleasure in the present and for which the brain stops projecting into the future so now let's talk about craving and and the these so-called Here and Now molecules and how those engage in a kind of pushpull balance that will allow you to not just feel more motivated but also to enjoy the things in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree we have neurons in an area of our brain called the rap r a p he e the RAF releases serotonin at different places in the brain serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have I've talked before about exteroception exteroception is a focus on the outside world everything beyond the confines of your skin I've also talked about interoception a focus on things that are happening internally within the confines of your skin dopamine and serotonin can be thought of as related to exteroception dopamine makes us focused on things outside us that are beyond what we call our personal space where we actually have to move and take action in order to achieve things and serotonin in general has to do with the things that are in our immediate Here and Now hence the description of these as the Here and Now molecules so it's interesting to point out that the body and the Brain can direct its attention towards things outside us or inside us or split our attention between those just understand that dopamine biases us toward thinking about what we don't have whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules like the endoc canabo if you picked up on the word cannabinoid yes it's like cannabis because cannabis attaches to endoc canabo receptors and the endoc canabo are receptors and chemicals that the cannabinoids that you naturally make that are involved in things like forgetting but you make these molecules that bind to these receptors that make you feel kind of bliss out and content in the present so you got these two systems they're kind of like a push pull and if you were to say do the um you know in the book wherever you go there you are John katzin talks about this meditation practice that's different than most meditation prct ractic is where you eat one almond and you focus all of your attention on the Almond the taste of the Almond the texture of the Almond that's really a mindfulness practice that's geared towards trying to take a behavior which is normally about Pursuit normally feeding is we going we engage in feeding because of dopamine we pursue more of a food because of that pleasure pain relationship I talked about before the focus on the one almond or the or becoming very present in any behavior that normally would be a kind of extra receptive Pursuit behavior and bring it into the here and now that's a mental trick or a mental task that the mindfulness Community has really embraced in order to try and create increased pleasure for what you already have it's really trying to accomplish a shift from dopamine being released to serotonin in the cannabinoid system being involved in that behavior dopamine has the quality of making people kind of rabidly in pursuit of things drugs like marijuana the opioids anything that um really hits the serotonin system hard tend to make people rather lethargic and content to stay exactly where they are they don't want to pursue much at all so you've got these molecules like dopamine that make you focused on the things you want and the things you crave and then you've got the molecules that make you content with what you have so the most important thing perhaps in creating a healthy emotional landscape is to have a balance between these two neuromodulator systems so at about this point in the podcast I'm guessing that some of you are thinking okay great I want more dopamine I want to be more motivated I don't want to procrastinate as much and I want to be able to experience life I want these Here and Now molecules to be released as well well there is a way to do that but you have to understand the source of procrastination is not one thing there are basically two kinds of procrastinators or so says the research the first kind are people that actually really enjoy the stress of the impending deadline it's the only way they can get into action there are other procrastinators for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine for those people there are a variety of things that can increase dopamine I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor I've talked about makuna purines which is 99.9% L Doopa the precursor to dopamine there are anti-depressants like Wellbutrin Bryon is the other name for it which increase dopamine and epinephrine however if you think back to our earlier discussion about dopamine dopamine if it's very high creates a sense of pleasure and the desire for more so you can also become a person for which enough is Never Enough the only thing that dopamine really wants is more of the thing that releases dopamine and so one of the things that you can do in order to generally just be a happier person especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals of any kind is the longer that you can extend that positive phase of the dopamine release and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that the better and you can actually do this cognitively I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper I would get really excited but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited what I wanted to do instead and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the Arc of that positive experience as long as I possibly can simply by thinking back like oh that was really cool I really enjoy doing that work I really enjoyed the discovery I really enjoyed doing that with the people that I was working with at the time what a pleasure that was so you can extend pleasure without having to engage in the behavior over and over that's extending the Arc of that dopamine release as well it offsets some of the pain of not having that experience occur over and over and over again now for the high performers out there you're probably familiar with this many people who have a big achievement their first thoughts are well now what what am I going to do next how am I ever going to exceed that and indeed many people who are very high on this kind of dopamine sensation and novelty-seeking scale uh are prone to addiction they're prone to the Rabid pursuit of external goals of exter reception to the neglect of these internal mechanisms that allow them to feel calm and happy so for people that are very driven very motivated adopting a practice of being able to engage in the here and now the sort of omen type practices we talked about earlier um of learning how to achieve a really good night's sleep on a regular basis through tools and mechanisms I talked about in previous podcast gives us sort of balance to the pleasure seeking and offsetting of pain and the pleasure in the here and now so pleasure is really two things it's a joy in Pursuit but it's also the joy in what you have the cool thing is you can actually regulate this whole system in a way that will steer you or lean you towards more positive anticipation of things in life and less disappointment it's simply a matter of adjusting what we call the dopamine schedule in order to understand how to control the dopamine system how to leverage it for a better life you need to understand the results of a very important experiment this experiment was able to separate pleasure from motivation it's a very simple but like many simple experiments a very elegant experiment what they did and this has now been done in animals and in humans they offered rats food it was a food that they particularly liked and the animals would lever press for rep pellet of food kind of classic experiment they'd eat the food and they presumably like the food because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it great they took other rats they eliminated the dopamine neurons you can do this by injection of a neurotoxin that destroys these neurons so they actually had no dopamine in their brain they have no ability to release dopamine and they gave them a lever the rats would sit there and they'd hit the lever and they'd eat the food they're still enjoyed the food so you say well okay so dopamine isn't involved in motivation it isn't involved in pleasure no it absolutely is they could still enjoy the food but if they moved the rat literally one body length away from the lever what they found was the animals that had dopamine would move over to the lever press it and eat and the ones the rats that did not have dopamine available to them wouldn't even move one body length one rat length to the lever in order to press it and get the food dopamine therefore is not about the ability to experience pleasure it is about motivation for pleasure and so many of you are probably thinking wow I'm not a very motivated person like you talked about the one kind of procrastination earlier what about when I just feel kind of meh about life now for some of you there may be a real clinical depression and you should talk to a professional there are very good prescription drugs that can really help people there's also great non-drug treatments of uh Psychotherapy and other treatments that are being developed in addition to psychotherapy and the various kinds of psychoanalysis Etc that one can use I think the data really point to the fact that a combination of pharmacology and talk therapies are generally best and there are a huge range of these things I know many of you are in these professions so we're not going to talk about that right now there is a compound that's kind of interesting in the supplement space that isn't um munan alopa it's not El tyrosine that isn't promoting massive releases of dopamine or even dopamine alone but a combination of dopamine and serotonin and it's an intriguing molecule it's um sold over the counter again you have to check with your Healthcare um uh provider before you would take anything or remove anything that's very important but it's phenol ethyl amine or pea pea or beta phenol ethyl aiming releases dopamine at low levels but also serotonin at low level so it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules as well as the quote unquote Here and Now molecules and people's response to this varies widely but many people report feeling heightened sense of mental acuity well-being Etc it is a bit of a stimulant like anything that triggers activation of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway but is an interesting supplement so now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule and how you can leverage this in order to have heightened levels of motivation but not get so much dopamine that you're experiencing a crash afterwards and also so that you can experience heightened pleasure from the various Pursuits that you are engaged in in life and here's the key principle dopamine is very subjective meaning you can either allow yourself to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone of a achieving or some craving or not it's actually pretty powerful what one can do with the subjective system in fact I'm going to describe you an experiment that highlights just how powerful the subjective readout or the subjective interpretation of a given experience really can be even at the level of pharmacology and the title of the experiment is expectation for stimulant type modifies caffeine's effects on mood and cognition this was done in college students it's a f fascinating study what they did is they gave college students either Placebo essentially nothing or 200 milligrams of caffeine 200 milligrams of caffeine is about what's in a typical coffee like a medium coffee that you would buy a drip coffee so they took 65 undergraduate students in college they randomized them to either Placebo or caffeine and they told them that they were either getting caffeine or adero now Aderall cognitively carries a very different um expectation college students know Aderall to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine they know it to create a sort of high this is the way the students described it and they thought that it would increase their level of focus and their ability to perform work so what's really interesting is there was definitely an effect of placebo versus caffeine that's not surprising however right you take a placebo you may or may not feel more alert um but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine very likely you're going to feel very alert but there was also an effect of whether or not the students thought they were getting caffeine or Aderall the subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling more stimulated anxious and motivated than the subjects that received the placebo okay but the ones that expected Aderall reported stronger amphetamine effects they performed better on a working memory test and in general they had all the increased cognitive effects that would have been seen with adol but they were only ingesting caffeine so it led to heightened performance simply because the students thought they were getting Aderall and I think this is very important because I think that it points to the fact that the the the top down the kind of higher level cognitive processes are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects of say dopamine release or our uh adrenaline release or epinephrine release in ways that can positively impact performance in this case it was a positive Improvement in working memory and focus so today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system and and those kinds of schedules that will allow craving or addiction but what's the schedule of dopamine that's going to allow you to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain and we get the answer to that from our good friend gambling the reason gambling works the reason why people will throw their lives away the reason why people go back again and again and again to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City is because of the hope and anticipation it's a those are cities and places built on dopamine they are leveraging your dopamine system and as a friend of mine who's a certified addiction treatment specialist tells me that you know gambling addiction is a particularly Sinister because the next time really could be the thing that changes everything unlike other addictions the next time really could change everything and that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict and rarely does it work out uh in favor of the well-being of the gambling addict and their family however the intermittent reinforcement schedule was discovered Long Ago by scientific researchers so this is the slot machine that every once in a while gives you a win to keep you playing this is the the probability of winning on the craps table or the roulette table or at Blackjack just often enough that you're willing to buy tickets head out there play again go downstairs again from your room even though you swear you were done for the night intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something so we can export that we can use it for good if there's something that you're pursuing in life whether or not it's an academic goal or a financial goal or relationship goal one of the things that you can do to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal for a very long time and that you will continue to exceed your previous performance as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine Rel that occurs when you hit the Milestones that you want to achieve is to occasionally remove reward subjectively let's say you set out a goal of making I'm going to make this quantitative with respect to finances because it just is an easy description but this could also be in sport this could be in school this could be in music could be in anything creative Endeavors but let's say you set out a certain Financial goal or let's say you want to get a certain number of followers on whatever social media platform as you reach each one of those goals you should know now that the amount of dopamine is not going to Peak it's actually going to diminish and make you crave more the key to avoiding that crash but to still keep it in healthy levels that will allow you to continue your Pursuit is as you are staircasing toward your goal you actually want to blunt the reward response for some of those intermediate goals now I'm not telling you you shouldn't celebrate your wins but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them or as a good friend of mine who uh recently uh fortunately for him uh had a great financial success he asked me and somebody else a good friend of mine who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules understands how they work at a really deep level and he said I don't know what to do next and we said oh well that's simple you should just give most of it away and this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves this was really about reducing the impact of that reward now hopefully giving him money away if you already have enough of it would be something that was rewarding in and of itself but if you're a student who's pursuing goals in University or you're an athlete who's pursuing goals it actually makes sense from a rational perspective once you understand these mechanisms to hit a new high point of performance or to get that A+ or for you if it's an A minus Etc and to tell yourself okay that was good but to actually actively blunt the reward to not go and celebrate too intensely because in doing that you keep your dopamine system in check and you ensure that you're going to stay on the path of continued Pursuit not just for that thing but for all things big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the anti so you can lift the uh what Las Vegas and Atlantic City and other gambling uh mechanisms and places have known for a long time they lifted it from the scientists you can now take it back and you can start to leverage that and you just make it intermittent you reward yourself not on a predictable schedule so not every other time or every third time or every 10th time but sometimes it's three in a row then not at all for 10 days so reward is important self-reward is critically important but make sure that you're not doing it on such a predictable schedule that you burn out these dopamine circuits or that you undercut your own ability to strive and Achieve hopefully you now know far more about the dopamine system reward and motivation than you did at the beginning of this podcast hopefully you also understand the other side of dopamine and reward which is pain and the balance of this pleasure pain system as well as the molecules that we call or that were described in the molecule of more book I should say as the Here and Now molecules things like serotonin and the endoc canabo finally I want to thank you for your time and attention today I hope you learned a lot and that you learned a lot of possible tools that you could incorporate into your life as it relates to motivation and emotions thank you for your interest in science [Music]

Title: How Foods & Nutrients Control Our Moods | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2025-01-23 13:00:28 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how the different nutrients and foods we eat impact our emotions and overall mood.

I discuss how the mind-body connection shapes our food choices and cravings, highlighting the roles of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin in driving eating behaviors. I explain the biological mechanisms behind cravings for specific foods, such as sugar, and how psychological factors like belief effects can influence our perception of hunger. I also describe how certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids, and a healthy gut microbiome are crucial in mood regulation and immune function.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. Today, we're talking all about emotions. Emotions are central to our entire experience of life. Whether or not we're happy or sad or depressed or angry is our life experience. And yet, I think with all the importance that we've placed on emotions, very few people actually understand how emotions arise in our brain and body. And I mentioned brain and body because as you'll see today, emotions really capture the brain body relationship. We cannot say that emotions arise just from what happens in our head. The other thing about emotions is that there's no real agreement as to what's a good emotion or a bad emotion. Today, we're going to talk about the biology of the chemicals and pathways that give rise to emotions in the context of food and nutrition. The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history going back to Darwin, and even long before Darwin. This is a conversation that philosophers and scientists have been having for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The idea that Darwin put forth and that was really attractive for about the last 100 years, was that emotions are universal, and that some of the facial expressions around emotion are universal. And other people have capitalized on that idea. And to some extent, it's true. I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of that would be when we see something or we smell something or we taste something that we like, there does tend to be a postural leaning in. We tend to Inhale air at that time. We tend to bring in more of whatever chemical substance is there. So we tend to do these, mm, and kind of lean in closer to things that are attractive to us. And when we see and experience things that we don't like, sometimes it's a mild aversion, we just kind of lean back or look away. Other times, it's an intense aversion of disgust and we tend to cringe our face. We tend to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals. This probably has roots in ancient biological mechanisms that are to prevent us from ingesting things that are bad for us, chemical compounds and tastes that might be poisonous. So much of the foundation of any discussion about emotion has to center around this kind of push-pull of attraction to things or aversion from things. Now, that's a very basic way of thinking about emotions. But if you think about it, it works for a lot of different circumstances. And in the brain everywhere, from the deep circuits of the brain to the more what we call higher order evolved centers of the brain, we have this push-pull thing. In a previous episode I talked about go. The circuits that allow you to emphasize action, and then no-go circuits, the circuits in the basal ganglia that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent action. And so we can break down the discussion about emotions into these simpler versions of themselves. But at the core of attraction or aversion is an important theme that you might realize already, but most people tend to overlook, which is that there's an action there. You're either moving forward or you're moving away from something. The brain has a body so that the organism can move. And the body has a brain, so that the organism, you, can move toward or away from things that you deem to be good or bad for you. So there are circuits in the brain for aversion and for attraction toward things. And the body is governing a lot of that. And so immediately in this conversation, I want to raise an important point, which is about a nerve pathway that many, many people have heard of that gets discussed all the time, and that is one of the most oversold for the wrong reasons and undersold, unfortunately, for its real power, which is the vagus nerve. So the vagus nerve is one-- not the only, but one way in which our brain and body are connected and regulates our emotional states. So what is the vagus nerve? Vagus is the 10th cranial nerve, which basically means that the neurons, the control center of each of those neurons in the vagus lives just kind of near the neck. And a branch of the vagus goes into the brain. The other branch goes into the periphery. But not just the gut. It goes into the stomach, the intestines, the heart, the lungs, and the immune system. So the way to think about the vagus is the same way I would think about the eyes. The eyes are looking at colors. They're looking at motion. They're looking at how bright it is. And each one of those things, those features, is telling the brain something different. So the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep, whether or not it's looking at somebody attractive or unattractive. The vagus nerve is also analyzing many features within the body, and informing the brain of how to feel about that, and what to do. So a really good example that I think is an exciting one is as it relates to sugar. So we all know that sweet things generally taste good. So that makes sense, right? You eat something, it tastes sweet, you want more of it. Well, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that. When you eat something sweet, within your stomach, you have cells, neurons that sense the presence of sugary foods independent of their taste and signal to the brain. So those sensors, those neurons send information up the vagus to your brain, goes through a series of stations. And then you release dopamine, this molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is that you just ingested. In fact, this pathway is so powerful that they've done experiments where they completely numb all the taste and feeling in somebody's mouth. They're blindfolded so they don't know what they're eating. And they're eating a food that's either sugary or not sugary. And what they find is that even though people can't taste the sugary food, they crave more of the food that contains sugar because of the sensors in the gut that sense sugar. And what it tells us is that we have circuits in our body that are driving us toward certain behaviors and making us feel good, even though we can't perceive them. Now, for those of you that are really interested in gut intuition and gut feelings, this is a gut feeling. Except this is a chemical gut feeling. This is a particular set of neurons detecting that something in your body has a particular feature-- in this case, the presence of sugars-- and sending information to the brain to essentially to control your behavior. And I find this remarkable. I mean, this should completely reframe the way that we think about the so-called hidden sugars in foods. What this means is that even if a food is very savory, like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread, or even like a salad dressing, if there's sugar snuck into that and you can't taste it, you will still crave more of that thing without knowing that you crave it because it has sugar. So I find this to be a fascinating aspect of our biology. A lot of how we feel while we eat and after we eat is because of this vagus sensing of what's in our gut. It's sending information all the time. Is there sugar? Are there fats? Are there contaminants? There are a lot of information, these so-called parallel pathways that are going up into our brain that regulate whether or not we want to eat more of something or not. And there are accelerators, things that make us want to eat more, like sugar and fats, because those are nutrient dense. And they help, generally, at least in the short term, support the survival of animals. But also amino acids. And this is very important. There are a lot of data, but much of what comes from the data on what people eat and how much they eat is from a subconscious detection of how many amino acids and what the array, meaning the constellation of amino acids, is in a given food. And it's fair to say that the sum total of these studies point in a direction where people will basically eat not until their stomach is full, but until the brain perceives that they have adequate intake of amino acids. Its amino acids, of course, are important because they are the building blocks of, sure, muscle and the other things in our body that need repair. But what most people don't realize is that amino acids are what the neurochemicals in the brain are made from. Now, this is vitally important. OK, so we've heard dopamine is this molecule that makes you feel good. Dopamine release is caused by surprise, excitement, events that you're looking forward to and that turn out well. It is inhibited by events you're looking forward to that don't work out. It's called reward-prediction-error. Your expectation of something releases dopamine and the actual event releases dopamine. And if the event-related dopamine does not exceed the expectation or at least match it, there's a much higher tendency that you won't pursue that thing again. Dopamine is what's going to lead us to want to eat more of something, or to not want more of something, because dopamine really is about craving. It's about motivation, and it's about desire. And as I mentioned, these amino acid sensors in our gut are detecting how many amino acids, but they're also detecting which amino acids. And there's a particular amino acid called l-tyrosine, which comes from food. It is in meats, it is in nuts. It is also in some plant based foods. L-tyrosine is the precursor to a couple other molecules like l-dopa, et cetera, that make dopamine. However, the dopamine neurons that give rise to these feelings of good or wanting more or desire and motivation, those reside in the brain. So we don't want to get too confused. We want to respect and honor the power of the gut and this vagal pathway. But it's really neurons within your brain that drive the pursuit and decision making. So what does this mean? Well, some people make too little dopamine. Some people make so little dopamine that they need prescription dopamine. They need l-dopa. People with Parkinson's take l-dopa and other compounds to increase dopamine. Because Parkinson's is associated with deficits in movement. Parkinson's is a depression. It's a blunting of motivation and mood and affect. And it's a tremor. And then, eventually, in severe conditions, it's challenges in speaking and walking. So some famous examples would be, you know, Muhammad Ali, Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach. These people have Parkinson's and they, at least later in their life, had challenges speaking. Now some people immediately ask, well, should I supplement l-tyrosine? It does increase kind of mood and elevation and alertness. It is over-the-counter. You have to check with your doctor-- I am not responsible for your health care, and I'm not a doctor-- whether or not it's safe for you. People with pre-existing hyperdopaminergic conditions like mania should probably not take l-tyrosine. The other thing about taking l-tyrosine is there is a crash. It's not a massive crash if you take it at appropriate doses and it's right for you. But it can produce a crash and a lethargy and a kind of brain fog after the next day or so. And so l-tyrosine, however, can be ingested through foods or through supplementation to increase dopamine levels. That's well known. Taking chronically, however, it can disrupt those dopamine pathways. Let's just kind of take stock of where we're at. We have a brain-body connection. There are many of them, but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve. The vagus collects information about a lot of things, breathing, heart rate, stuff that's happening in the gut, et cetera. And gut, by the way, includes the stomach and the intestines. Sends that information up to the brain. The brain is using that information to decide one of two things, move toward something or move away. It can also pause, but essentially pausing is not moving toward. So that's the dopamine pathway. And foods rich in l-tyrosine generally give us an elevated mood and make us want to do more of whatever it is that we happen to be doing, as well as other things. Motivation generalizes to other things. It's not unique to just ingesting foods. But foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine will make us crave more of that food. It will make us crave more of the activity that led to the ingestion of that food. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level that you're not even aware of. So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting in the context of the vagus is serotonin. Serotonin, just to remind you, is a neuromodulator. Therefore, it creates a bias in which neural circuits, which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active. And it makes it less likely that other ones are going to be active. And serotonin, when it's elevated, tends to make us feel really comfortable and kind of blissed out wherever we are. And that contrast with dopamine and epinephrine, which mainly put us in pursuit of things. Motivation is pursuit. The conversation around the brain, body, relationship and mood and serotonin for many years was, well, you eat a big meal. The gut is distended. You've got all the nutrients you need, you rest and digest and serotonin is released. That's sort of true, but there's a lot more going on. And a lot more that's interesting and actionable that's going on. First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all, have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin that we make is in our gut. And indeed, we have a lot of serotonin in our gut. But here's the deal most of the serotonin that impacts our mood and our mental state is not in our gut. Most of it is in the neurons of the brain in an area called the raphe nucleus of the brain. There are a few other locations, too. You can't have a discussion about serotonin without having a discussion about antidepressants, because during the late '80s and early '90s, there was this explosion in the number of prescription drugs that were released. The first one and most famous one is Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil, a number of other ones that are so-called SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Basically, those drugs work by preventing the gobbling up of serotonin, or reuptake of serotonin, into neurons after it's been released. Which leads to more serotonin overall, which means to elevated serotonin. And indeed, those drugs were and can be very useful for certain people to feel better in cases of depression, and some other clinical disorders as well. Not everyone responds well to them, as I'm sure you've all heard. And their side effect profile has effects like blunting affect. It can make people feel kind of flat, kind of meh. Many people adjust their serotonin by just eating more food. And carbohydrate-rich foods will increase serotonin. I eat a relatively high protein and moderate fat, zero-carb or low-carb meal at lunch and in the afternoon to stay alert. Because those foods tend to favor dopamine production, acetylcholine production, epinephrine production, and alertness. My mood is generally pretty good most of the time. And then as evening comes around and I'm concerned about sleep and a good night's sleep-- not concerned in an anxious way, but I want to get a good night's sleep-- I will ingest foods that promote serotonin release because they contain a lot of tryptophan. So as you're seeing, this isn't really a discussion about nutrition, per se. This is a discussion about food which contains amino acids. Amino acids being the precursors to neuromodulators. And neuromodulators, having a profound effect on your overall state of alertness or calmness, happiness, sadness, and well-being. So now you understand the relationship, I hope, between foods and dopamine, foods and serotonin. And that they're both being communicated to the brain via the vagus. So let's talk a little bit more about things that we ingest in our body and then allow our body to inform our brain to shift our mood. But I don't think most people know this simple fact. Which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio has a profound effect on depression. First of all, in an experiment done in animals, they found there's a model of learned helplessness in animals. It's not very kind to the animals, but they put rats or mice in a jar. They let them swim. And they'll swim, swim, swim to try and save their life. And eventually they give up. It's a learned helplessness. They don't let them drown. They take them out. Adjusting the omega-3 and omega-6 ratio so that the omega-3s are higher led to less learned helplessness, meaning these animals would swim longer. But that same study was essentially done in humans. What they did is they took people who were clinically depressed, major depression-- major depression is severe maladaptive state, meaning it inhibits job, relationships, appetite, all sorts of negative health effects-- and they did a comparison of 1,000 milligrams a day of EPA. So EPA is one of the elements that contains high levels of omega-3s that's in things like fish oil. But it wasn't 1,000 milligrams of fish oil, it was 1,000 milligrams of EPA. Compared that to 20 milligrams of fluoxetine, which is Prozac. They found that they were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms. And what was really interesting, in addition to that, is that the combination of 1,000 milligrams of EPA and fluoxetine had a synergistic effect in lowering depressive symptoms. And now there are lots of studies. If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA or fish oil and depression, you would find that there were a number of really impressive results showing that it's at least as effective as certain SSRIs, antidepressants, at these dosages. And it can amplify or improve the effect of low dosages of some of these SSRIs. You can discuss it with your doctor and family and make the choices that are right for you. Now, of course, I really want to emphasize something, which is that no one compound or nutrient or supplement or drug-- or behavior, for that matter-- is going to be all, end all of shifting out of depression, or improving one's mood or improving sleep. You cannot expect to take a compound, regardless of source or potency, and have it completely shift your experience of life without having to continue to engage in the proper behaviors. All the things we know. Proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera. So now let's turn to another aspect of the gut brain relationship that will surprise you. In some cases, might shock you. And that has some really cool and actionable biology. And that's the gut microbiome, probiotics and prebiotics. So what's the deal with the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis? Today, we've actually been talking a lot already about the gut brain axis that has nothing to do with microbiomes. We've been talking about this vagus nerve that connects-- providing sensory information from the body to the brain. And then the brain also sends, in the same nerve, motor information to control the motility, the gut, the heart rate, how fast we breathe, and deployment of immune stuff. But oftentimes when we hear about the gut-brain axis these days, it's a discussion about the gut microbiome. I'm very happy there's so much discussion about the gut microbiome. I am somewhat dismayed and concerned that most of what I hear out there is either false or partially false. So we're going to clear up some of the misconceptions, first, by understanding the biology. And then we're going to talk about some of the actionable items. It is true that we have a lot of these little microorganisms living in our gut. They're not there because they want to help us. They don't have brains. They are adaptive, however. They try and find and create environments that make it easier for them to proliferate. So they don't care about you and me, but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me in order to make more of themselves. The microbiota that live in us vary along the length of our digestive tract. So we are one long tube for digestion. And inside of that tube is a mucosal lining. And the conditions of that mucosal lining set a number of different things. It sets the rate of our digestion and the quality of our digestion. It sets, for instance, our immune system. We're ingesting things all the time. Think about air, bacteria, viruses, they're making their way into our gut. And some of those bacteria live in the gut. And some of those bacteria bias the mucosal lining in the gut, stomach and intestines, to be more acidic or more basic so that they can make more of themselves. So they can replicate. Now, some of those mucosal linings that they promote make us feel better. They make us feel more alert. They bolster our immune system. And others make us feel worse. So first rule, the microbiome isn't good or bad. Some of these little bugs that live in us do bad things to us. They make us feel worse. They lower our immunity. They affect us in negative ways. Some of them make us feel better. And they do that mainly by changing the conditions of our gut environment. In addition to that, they do impact the neurotransmitters and the neurons that live in the gut, and that signal up to the brain to impact things like dopamine and serotonin that we've been talking about previously. So there's a vast world now devoted to trying to understand what sources of food, what kinds of foods are good or not good for the gut microbiome? Here's a few things that I think you might find surprising. First of all, supporting a healthy gut microbiome is good for mood, great for digestion, and great for immune system function. However, that does not mean maxing out or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic that you can possibly manage. As I mentioned many times before, I do believe in probiotics, I take probiotics. But there are studies that show that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics, like lactobacillus, and you really ramp up the levels more, it is not a case of more is better. There are things like brain fog that can come from that. Brain fog is just this inability to focus. People feel really not well, generally. Some of those studies are a little bit controversial, but I think it's fair to say that if people really increase the amount of probiotic that they're taking beyond a certain amount, then they start feeling foggy in the mind. The ingestion of fermented foods is one of the best ways to support healthy levels of gut microbiota without exceeding the threshold that would cause things like brain fog. So much so that some people report that when they start eating small bits, because it doesn't require a lot of fermented foods, that their overall mood is better. Not unlike the effects of EPA, although I don't think it's been looked at directly in the context of clinical depression yet. There are some things that you can do to really damage your gut microbiome. And this is where there's a huge misconception that I want to clear up. There was a study that showed that artificial sweeteners, but a particular artificial sweetener, which was saccharin, can disrupt the gut microbiome in ways that is detrimental to a number of different health markers. Increasing inflammatory cytokines and all the other bad things that happen when the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter. Saccharin is not the most typical artificial sweetener that's used. The most typical sweetener. Artificial sweeteners that are used are things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet, or sucralose, or these days, stevia. To my knowledge, the negative effects of artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome were restricted to saccharin. So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners, in particular saccharin, disrupt the microbiome and make the environment within the gut, that mucosal lining, more favorable to bacteria microbiota that are not good for the organism. This is an important distinction. It's not just that a language thing where people say, oh, it kills the microbiome. It doesn't kill the microbiome. It shifts the microbiome. And shifts in the microbiome can be good or they can be bad. And that takes us to another topic that's a bit of a hot button topic, but I'm willing to go there because I think it deserves conversation. Which is nowadays, there are many examples out there where people have switched from a kind of standard diet, or even a vegetarian diet, or vegan diet to a keto diet. Now, keto doesn't necessarily have to mean the ingestion of meats, but it can. And they experience positive effects for themselves. But the ketogenic diet is interesting because when one shifts to the ketogenic diet, there is a shift in the gut microbiome, and some people end up feeling better, some people end up feeling worse. Likewise, some people go from ingesting animal products, including meat, or they're vegetarian and they go to vegan, and they experience positive shifts in mood and affect. So the point of all this is that when I say, you have to find what's right for you, that's not a throwaway statement. Some people's microbiome and the mucosal lining of their, of their throat, of their gut, of their nose, everything is improved by diets that are heavily meat-based and don't have many plants. Other people do much better on a plant-based diet without many meat products or animal products. It's highly individual. And this probably has roots in genetic makeup. This probably has roots in what people were raised on. Because remember, the nervous system, of course, is set up by your genes, your genetic program. But your nervous system adapts early in life to your conditions. That's what it's for. The reason you have a nervous system is to move your body appropriately towards things that are good for you, and away from things that are not. But also it was designed to adapt so that, yes, indeed, some people may like certain foods and react to certain foods better than others because of the way that their nervous system was wired. This enteric, as it's called, nervous system that lines the gut, it communicates with the brain. So most of what I've talked about today is a black and white. These are things that are present in all of us. The sugar sensing neurons of the gut, the way the vagus is wired. The fact that omega-3, omega-6s tend to improve-- the ratios tend to impact mood with high omega-3 and omega-6 ratios improving mood. We talked about all sorts of things in the gut-brain and body-brain axis. But when it comes to the microbiome, the key thing is that we all have a microbiome. You want a microbiome. But you want to promote the microbiome that is right for you. And that can be shifted and steered by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others. It's very clear that these fermented foods support the microbiome. That we should be ingesting at least two servings per day, which is quite a lot. That supplementation at low levels can be good. Supplementation at high levels can create this brain fog. Even though some people say that result is controversial, I've experienced this myself, and the data looked, to me, pretty darn solid. So that's one thing to think about as well. And the other thing about the gut microbiome is that it's highly contextual based on other things that you're doing. So even things like exercise and social well-being and connection, those things are also impacting the gut microbiome. So find the diet that's right for you and that works for you in the context of the other ethical and lifestyle choices that are important to you. That's my advice. So as we round up, I want to share some results with you that, without question, will impact the way that you respond to food, mentally and even physically. I have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum, who's done some remarkable experiments on mindset. Two that are particularly interesting to me I want to share with you now, because they really emphasize how our beliefs can really impact the way that our brain and body work together. I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did where they had two groups of individuals. They were each given a milkshake. And they had some factors measured from their blood by an IV while they ingested the milkshake, and then afterwards as well. And one of the factors that they were looking at was something called ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin is a peptide that increases with hunger. So the longer you haven't eaten, the ghrelin goes up. One group got a shake that they were told was a low-calorie, healthy shake. The other group got a milkshake that they were told was the very decadent high-calorie shake. And what they found was that the high-calorie shake had a much more robust effect on blunting ghrelin and reducing ghrelin. But the interesting thing you probably guessed already is that it was the exact same shake given to both groups. And this speaks to these so-called top-down mechanisms, or modulation of our physiology. In a previous episode about pain, we talked about the effects of obsessive infatuation and love on pain responses and pain thresholds. This is yet another example where beliefs or subjective feelings can impact physiology at the level of the periphery, because ghrelin is released in the periphery in the body. And so this is not just the placebo effect. This is an incredible set of findings that illustrate the extent to which, whether or not we believe a food is going to be good for us or not good for us, these belief effects are not about lying to yourself. So in order for them to work, you have to be naive to the information. You can't simply lie to yourself and tell yourself what you want to believe. And that's important. But also important is that the mind and the body are in this fascinating interplay. And today, we've talked mainly about how the body and things that we put inside this tube that runs from our mouth to the other end, to our rectum, basically, is impacting all these cells, these neurons, microbiota in there, mucosal lining, heart, lungs. And how all that information is feeding up to the brain to impact how we feel up here. But also how we feel up here is impacting how our body reacts at levels of very core physiology that you couldn't just tell yourself that this was going to work. But what you believe about certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients does have a profound effect on the magnitude of their impact. And sometimes even the quality and direction of that impact. So today's episode, we took a full journey into the brain-body relationship and discussed a lot of the mechanisms and the actionable items that you can approach if you want to explore this aspect of your biology and psychology further. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank everybody for your time and attention today. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: How Social Connection Increases Happiness
Published: 2025-01-21 01:15:00 UTC
Description:
Laurie Santos, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University and a leading researcher on happiness and fulfillment, discusses the importance of social connection and behavioral changes in enhancing happiness. She highlights research showing that increased time spent with friends and family, as well as physical presence around others, significantly predicts overall happiness.

Transcript Language: English
Most people would like to be happy as much as possible. I certainly would. Who wouldn't? And one of course can ask, "Well, should I work on my feelings? Like think about my feelings, try and shift my feelings, let my feelings move through me in a cathartic way. Should I work on the thought patterns? Should I work on the behaviors?" I'm a big believer, from my own experience, that behaviors are powerful in setting the general trajectory of thought patterns and feelings. But I've also experienced it going the other way, too. So what does the research say about this, and what can we do? 'Cause everyone wants to be happier. Yeah, well we just talked about the thing you're not supposed to do. You don't have to change your circumstances, and that's great. 'Cause like, quintupling your income is tricky, you know, moving is tricky, you know, switching your life around all over the place is hard, right? And the good news is the science shows you don't have to do that. That doesn't work as well as you think. But you can hack your behaviors and your thought patterns and your feelings to get some good results, right? Let's take behaviors, right? One of the biggest behavioral changes you can make to feel happier is just to get a little bit more social connection. Like, psychologists do these fun studies where they look at people's like, daily usage patterns. So how much time are you spending sleeping or exercising or at work or whatever. And the two things that predict whether or not you're happy or not so happy, is how much time you spend with friends and family members and how much time you're just physically around other people. Like, the more of that you do, the happier you're going to be.

Title: How to Identify Stars vs. Planets Based on Light
Published: 2025-01-20 20:36:34 UTC
Description:
Brian Keating, Ph.D., a cosmologist and professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego, discusses the phenomenon of scintillation—the twinkling of stars caused by atmospheric turbulence, which refracts light at varying angles and helps distinguish stars from non-twinkling planets.

Transcript Language: English
Now, what is the main effect of the atmosphere? Well, you learned it when you were a kid. Twinkle, twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are? What is that twinkling? It's called scintillation. Scintillation is a property of a point source, which is a star is so far away, even though they're enormous, they still only subtend a zero dimensional or almost zero dimensional dot of light on the sky. When it goes through the atmosphere, the atmosphere has macroscopic turbulence features. The atmosphere is a fluid. There's turbulence, there's roiling columns, there's cells of the atmosphere. And if you've ever looked at a star, they jitter, looks like they're moving around and that's the combination of the atmospheric cells, each column of air that has slightly more density will refract light slightly different angles. Remember we talked about light when it goes through a lens, it refracts, it bends. So should we be thinking about the light from stars kind of like a jagged line coming towards our eye? Exactly. It's coming through, it's getting deflected slightly, and it's moving and it's landing on different retinal cells. And we're perceiving that as this motion, or in a CCD. array. It's also landing on different pixels, so you can't get away from it, you know, by using technology. It's still an effect. It's caused by these atmospheric turbulence cells. And by the way, you can tell and you can identify a planet by the fact it does not scintillate. It does not twinkle, twinkle. When you look at the planet, you can identify them by their lack of scintillation. And so it's a way to identify if it's a plane, a star, or a planet.

Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Brian Keating, Ph.D., a cosmologist and professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. We discuss the origins of the universe and how humans have used light and optics to understand where and how life on Earth emerged.

We explore how early humans charted the stars, sun, moon, and other celestial events to measure time and track seasons, as well as how stargazing continues to connect us to a shared ancient experience. Additionally, we examine the scientific process, the practical and ethical challenges of pursuing groundbreaking discoveries, and the emotional toll of striving for recognition in one’s profession.

Finally, we discuss whether astrology has any scientific validity and consider the possibility of life beyond Earth.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Brian keading Dr Brian keing is a professor of cosmology at the University of California San Diego today's discussion is perhaps the most zoomed out discussion that we've ever had on this podcast what I mean by that is today we talk about the origins of the universe we talk about the Earth's relationship to the Sun and to the other planets we talk a lot about Optics so not just the Neuroscience of vision and our ability to see things up close and far away but to see things very very far away or very very close up using telescopes or microscopes respectively so today's discussion is a far-reaching one literally and figuratively and one that I know everyone will appreciate because it really will teach you how the scientific process is carried out it will also help you understand that science is indeed a human endeavor and that much of what we understand about ourselves and about the world around us and indeed the entire universe is filtered through that humanness but I want to be very clear that today's discussion is not abstract you're going to learn a lot of concrete facts about the universe about humanity and about the process of Discovery in fact much of what we talk about today is about the process of human humans discovering things about themselves and about the world Dr keing has an incredible perspective and approach to science having built for instance giant telescopes down at the South Pole and having taken on many other truly ambitious builds in service to this thing we call Discovery before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the General Public public in keeping with that theme this podcast episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with Dr Brian keing Dr Brian keading welcome Dr Andrew huberman it's great to meet you in person finally I thought you were a legend I exist in real life and uh and you do as well and I'm delighted that we're going to talk today because I have a longstanding adoration there's no other appropriate word for eyes Vision Optics the Stars the moons the sun I mean animals humans what's more interesting than than how we got here and how we see things and what we see and why that's right you're a physicist you're a cosmologist not a cosmetologist that's right I do do hair and makeup if you're interested please Orient Us in the Galaxy so I get to study you know the entire universe basically and it's not really such a a stretch that cosmetology and cosmology share this prefix because the prefix Cosmos is what relates those two words together that seem to be completely you know unrelated to each other right but it turns out the word Cosmos in Greek the atmology of it is beautiful or appearance so it's we have a beautiful appearance you know we we look a certain way we're attracted to certain things but it kind of reflects the fact that the night sky is also beautiful attractive and evoke something viscerally in us we humans are born with two refracting telescopes in our in our skulls embedded in our skulls and as you point out you know the retina outside the cranial Vault right I'll I'll never forget you saying that that means we have astronomical detection tools built into us we don't have tools to detect the higs Bon built into us or to look at a microscopic virus or something like that so astronomy is not only the oldest of all Sciences it's the most visceral one so connects us and of the Sciences of that branch of science of astronomical Sciences cosmology is really the most overarching it really includes everything all physical processes that were involved in the formation of matter of energy maybe of time itself and it speaks to a universal urge I think to know what came before us like I always ask people I'll ask you I I know what the answer is probably but what's your favorite day on the calendar favorite day on the calendar I love New Year's Day New Year's Day exactly what is that it's a beginning it's a new some people say their birthday their kids's birthday their if they're smart their anniversary right you know you don't want to get too out of out of control with the misses um what are those those are Beginnings what's the only event that no entity could even bear witness to the origin of the Universe I think that speaks to something Primal in human beings that are curious at least we want to un uncover the secrets of what existed what came before us and we don't have any way of seeing that currently so we have to use the fossils that have made their way throughout all of cosmic time to understand what that was like at the very beginning of time and perhaps maybe about the universe that as it existed before time itself began so to me it's it's incredibly fascinating it encompasses all of Science in some sense it even can include life on other planets Consciousness the formation of the brain and you know to me I'm always interested in the biggest questions and the biggest topics that evoke curiosity in me is how did it all get here and so that's what cosmology allows us to do apply the strict exacting laws of physics to a specific you know domain which is the origin of everything in the universe that's what makes it so fascinating I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need but nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium all in the correct ratios but no sugar proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function even a slight degree of of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it extremely easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element they have watermelon Citrus Etc frankly I love them all and now that we're in the winter months in the northern hemisphere element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock I really like the chocolate flavors especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up so you put in hot water and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate especially when it's cold and dry out outside when hydration is especially critical if you'd like to try element

episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about all issues that you're concerned about second of all it can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third expert therapy can provide useful insights with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you resonate with and

something that at least to me feels int intuitively so true and I think it's very likely to be true for everybody which is that there's something about looking up into space especially at night when we see the stars and yeah hopefully see the stars we'll talk about light pollution a little bit later when we see the stars that yes we know these things are far away yes we know that they occupy a certain position in space they have a a diameter Etc we might not know what that is just by looking at them you probably do but but they also change our perception of time and you know if I were to say one thing about the human brain especially is that sure it's got all these autonomic functions it regulates heart rate digestion Etc sleep wake Cycles it can remember it can think it can have States like Rage or anger or happiness or Delight but what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past it can be quote unquote present and it can project into the future and I'm sure other animals can do that but we do this exquisitly well and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time as a non-biologist but somebody who I think appreciates and understands biology why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky even though most people might not realize that those Stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are some of them probably are some of them aren't they existed a long time ago but without knowing that why do you think that looking up at the stars gives gives us the sense of an expansion of time as opposed to just the expansion of space hm well first of all we have to take ourselves back you know to deep prehistory we know that ancients were looking at um at the constellations because they were seemingly either in control of or correlated with or perhaps causitive of the seasons and that was of you know Divine important you know Supreme importance for them right their whole existence in early agrarian societies hunting societies Gathering socities um so they had to know about time so time the the essence of time and that large scale for seasons for holidays for festivals for propitiation of deds and so forth they had to keep track of it and that's why in the caves in Lasco that you know date back to the you know 40,000 bcee um they depict constellations Orion the hunter Taurus the Bull all these different constellations they depict them there now partially that was because you know Netflix didn't exist back then right there was no Tik Tok and and so there wasn't much to do at night and in fact the more you were out at night you probably increased your opportunity to be you know consumed by some Predator right so you were you were more focused on being stationary observing and as I said we can do astronomy uniquely so amongst all the Sciences with just the equipment we're born with you know measurements with our eyes with respect to landmarks to C calculate patterns and humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns sometimes too good so for instance knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say the um the Contour of a of a mountain ridge yes and and the and the repetition of it over and it passed down through generations before there was written language there was pictography there was the cave paintings and so forth there was oral language and that was it for you know written language is only you know 10,000 years old or something like that so to store information that meant it was a continuity between Generations my great- great grandfather's Elders whatever taught me that when the moon is in this constellation the sun is in this constellation um we all should plant or we should you know harvest in other con in other times and so it was and it we still do used the you know the rotation of the earth you know hasn't changed that much since this 40,000 year period right I mean the the axis in which it rotates that's a different story but uh but the the actual spin rate the angular momentum of the Earth has not appreciably changed that much and so the positions of these objects were of such importance uh that the Ancients would use them for all these purposes but there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them they're called planets so planet in Greek it's like the word plane like airplane it means something that moves or wanders so when you name something it means it's it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic so the planets there were only five that they could you know see at that time up to Saturn um and they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events but events down on Earth that's what connected the Earth so we we have Legacy of that in our calendar today so Sunday named after the Sun Monday Moon Tuesday and you go to the Latin languages I think it's Mercury Mercury day which is mercury day uh vent Venus day so you go to the romance languages and then uh the only one that's not a Latin name is of course for Thor the God Thor Thursday and then uh comes back Saturn day Saturday so they were all used as a clock and you people don't really grasp this I mean we have an Apple Watch we have whatever we didn't have a clock that was functional that would work on all different time zones that all different conditions on the pitching deck of a ship till the 1700s basically it was a huge problem and so measuring time became crucial for Commerce for uh you know human culture and civilization to arise for education and obviously for planting harvesting and so forth so there was an obvious connection between the two they believed actually that they were causitive that actually the position of the planet Jupiter determined something on the day of your birth and the son's relative position with respect to it determined something about your your your future and your and your you know prospects in life and and so forth so when I'm not confused for a cosmetologist you know because my lovely hair and makeup uh I'm usually asked you know oh you're an astronomer um I'm a Virgo you know so uh what's going to happen to me I'm like I used to be okay that's an astrologer I'm not an astrologer but now I just I kind of lean into it I'm like o that uh you're going to get a letter from the IRS next week and that lump on your ass mean you you're you're playing games with them so you don't believe in astrology uh there's no evidence for astrology in in fact there's there's you know many many random controlled you know trials double bun studies that show not only is it it's almost counter to the evidence you know like when they say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart and get you know do better than most hedge fund managers or something like that actually astrologers are even worse like I don't even know protozoa could throw a dart yeah it's it's almost anti-correlated you know with with what reality is so no there's certainly no validity to that and I I added you know provocative tweet uh you know whatever post recently um and it was about um there's actually you know we believe there are 12 zodiac con signs that dates back to the Persians and the Babylonians and how they divided up them and it almost divides you know they were fascinated with the number 60 so that that was the base of their number system our number system is 10 because we have 10 fig for some reason they love base 60 I don't know why um and so they love things that divided evenly into it 10 does but anyway uh you know hash fail for the for the Babylonians but they divide up into 12 12 uh zodiac signs so we still use those there's a problem though the Zodiac that you're do you know what this is do you know what determines your zodiac sign no okay so it it's determined by the position of the sun what constellation was the sun in on the day you were born September 26th so uh when the that means that the sun was in the constellation Vergo oh no you are a Libra Libra Libra okay so you do know what you are but you don't know why you are uh so Libra me means it's a constellation there's 88 constellations that are accepted by astronomers and the uh one of them is Libra and the path that the Sun and the Moon and all the planets travel and it's called the Zodiac it's confined to a plane because the same uh Proto Proto solar system dis from which we formed out of all the planets came out of a nebular cloud a cloud of gas dust rocks and so forth that came from a pre-existing star that exploded creating what's called a supernova the Supernova provided the materials to make not only the Earth but the entire solar system including the Sun that happened about five billion years ago and four billion years ago the Earth formed out of that cloud that the spin of that disc all things have a spin associated with them like a figure skater you know as she's spinning around on her Axis or whatever she can have her arms out brings them in she spins faster that's called conservation of angular momentum spin as a type of angular momentum the whole disc is spinning in a plane it's like this desk this table that sitting at if listening imagine a flat table it's spinning a circular disc is spinning with a certain direction all the objects are moving in that same direction due to conservation of this term called angular momentum the sun moves in that apparently moves in that position obviously we're rotating around the Sun but it looks like the sun's coming around us the Moon is Jupiter so on the day you were born there's a constellation behind the Sun from our perspective that was Libra on September 26th and that was the day that you were born that determines the fact that you're Libra but there's a problem in December where we are now the sun is actually in a different constellation the one that doesn't exist according to the Zodiac that was created something like 6 th 5,000 years ago it's called ukas so there's a certain segment of people born in a 17-day stretch in December late November to early December that are actually aukin or ukases or whatever so that should obliterate astrology as any semblance of a science because they didn't even know the constellation existed and yet something like 12% of all people share that constellation so it's just complete nonsense there's no validity to it twins that are born on the same day have radically different you know histories past Futures and um there's no predictive power to it and that's what science is about right we want to make a hypothesis test it iterate on it and have confirmation of it and there's zero in fact for astrology in fact if you'll permit me a kind of silly story uh when I was dating my wife who would become my wife in the beginning um we she you know kind of thought it's fun maybe we'll go see a you know uh uh you know someone who can tell our our our fortunes that we belong together so we went to an astrologer and uh the astrologer asked me a bunch of questions you know when were you born obviously and um oh no she asked me what's your sign so I I said I'm a Gemini and she said okay cool and then she told me a bunch of things and at the end I said I just want to double check and I was playing I'm kind of a you know a little bit of a jerk sometimes so I said I just want to confirm um Gemini is born in September I'm born in September setember 9th oh no no that's a Virgo but the same things are going to happen to you anyway like it didn't change her outcome and so in the language of the science philosophy of science Carl poer others it's unfalsifiable and you cannot be proven right it's so flexible you know you're going to find challenges the stock market is going to fluctuate uh political turmoil rain during your they're so flexible it can accommodate any story and that's a Hallmark of non-science or sometimes anti-scientific thinking one thing that strikes me is the fact that at least is the way you describe it the first clock the first timekeeping approach or mechanism was to evaluate the position of things in the sky relative to Celestial landmarks yeah so irrespective of when people are born in astrology uh I could imagine a a a tribe of people a group of people who have charts because they've you know painted them onto some surface doesn't matter with the surface is that um at some portion of the year uh the stars are above this Ridge there are three bright stars above the the the ridge just to the to the left of the front of the village so to speak like this is not an unreasonable thing to imagine and that information has passed down in the form of when those three stars are about to disappear behind that Ridge um days are getting shorter whereas when those three stars are um reemerging again elsewhere in the sky yes days are getting longer um forgive me this will be a little bit of a long question sometimes the listeners get upset with me but I think it'll frame it within the biology in a way that that will be meaningful for us and for everyone other animals besides humans have this thing the pineal gland that secretes melatonin the duration of melatonin release is directly related to how much light there is in other words light suppresses melatonin therefore in short days AKA long nights you get a lot more melatonin released in long days and short nights you get less melatonin so this is the intrinsic clock keeping mechanism of all mamalian species and reptiles most people don't realize this but reptiles um often have either a thin skull birds have a very thin skull so that light can actually pass through the skull to the pineal some reptiles actually have pits in the top of their heads that light can pass directly in to the pineal these are animals that mind you also have eyes for perceiving things but this is the primordial biologically primordial timekeeping device and you imagine why this would be really important and then I'll get back to why I think that because humans have a pineal that's embedded deep in the brain light cannot despite what some people think out there I'm not going to name names but light cannot get through the skull to the pineal nor is putting a a light in your ear ears going to get there or even in the roof of your mouth very unlikely maybe some distant stimulation of the neurons in your hypothalamus with long wavelength light but in any case the pineal of humans is embedded deep in the skull and so that information about uh how much light is in the environment has to be passed through the eyes through a Securus circuit to the through a Securus path to the to the pineal but here's the thing here here's the the conundrum an animal or human born into an 8-hour day when days are getting longer has a very different future as an infant as a infant or baby that's born into an8 hour day when days are getting shorter especially if you live closer to the poles further from the equator so think about this you're a pregnant woman or you're the husband of that pregnant woman and you have a baby coming and you need to know that days are getting longer or shorter and what that means for resources because the probability of the survival of that child and and even the mother during and immediately after uh childbirth was strongly dictated by what resources were available the strength of the immune system Etc animals solve this by light going directly into the pineal I'm not one of those animals so I don't know if they're conscious of this humans needed to solve this some other way they needed to know whether or not days were getting longer or shorter and so the question I have is is the movement of the stars or planets detect able enough with these telescopes that we have in the front of our skull is it perceivable enough that one could know whether or not days were getting longer or shorter simply by looking up at the sky at night or are the shifts imperceptible and therefore you would need to create these charts and now I think it's kind of obvious while I'm asking this question because to me this is the reason to chart time and this is the reason it occurs to me why looking up at the sky at night is Meaningful for tracking time absolutely absolutely and and not only correlated with that um something even more perhaps basic is you know temperature right in the hemisphere that you're born in uh you would expect that all you know I'm I'm born as I said September 9th turns out that's the statistically statistically most common birth date of humans on Earth and why is that because people are busy during the winter holiday exactly right so there's a correlation right yeah they're at home and they're indoors and and they're they're procreating and they right um or another thing is uh uh what month you're born in you go back nine months so so actually the the um you know cons uh capitalism is awesome right so it's so efficient so when you go to CVS I I've known this you know several times thank God because my wife's been pregnant several times and um and we have several kids and when you go to CVS it's it's actually pretty interesting she goes there to buy a pregnancy test now she's the kind of neurotic you know person that she she had to buy like five pregnancy tests for each kid okay I don't know why but that's what she did so she's a she likes data she's got the how do you okay everybody statistics how do you reduce variability increase sample size yes unless it's a systematic error and that's what I want to talk to you about later when it comes to the eye and other things you go to CVS you buy a pregnancy test and you know she's on their gold plan program you know whatever she got the gold card from CVS uh because she's done it so many times uh but um when you go there they know you're getting a pregnancy test so exactly nine months later we start getting advertisements for Pampers and for diapers and for diaper creams and wipes and stuff because they know this they know hedging even without KN the test what's the downside for them well she buys five tests they're probably assuming something very different than if she bought one test anyway so uh the temperature right so if you're gestating during uh summertime versus winter time that obviously will have some kind of an effect I mean you can tell me a lot more than that but more than that you hinted at this um and I'm not going to make you do any any math surrounding pregnancy but um God forbid but I sympath I put out the cor I was talking fast with the irony of that one I'll just say for the record I'm just blushing the the irony of that one is that we published numerous times for my lab cumulative probability and I teach this stuff so it's often times when you're going fast but that one I totally deserved and I you know whatever whatever shades of red I might I might turn that's what a good scientist does but uh but but they actually think that the first astronomers were women think about it because they notice this correlation what's their monthly cycle their menstrual cycle is exactly 29 and a half days which is actually the lunar cycle down to almost the minute it's insane right um that that they would have looked up and noticed this renewal and and and and diminishing of the Moon and that there's actually evidence now they weren't professional astronomers until you know actually the first professional female astronomer wasn't until like the 1700s in England um where she was recognized for using telescopes and so forth but but no they were very keen on that and they were they were probably dialed into that and what that portended as you alluded to for the future of their child I mean this is a huge biological investment men didn't don't have that so actually we are less symmetrical you know this than women right we have our testies or different links or whatever I guess normal normal men at least but women are more symmetrical but they're actually they have an extra timekeeping device that men we can't relate to that they're menstrual cycle they're menstral cycle some women are keenly aware of the ovulation event they will describe it as a feeling as if it's breaking off and and migrating within them and I I have every reason to believe them earlier you asked and I know this um will get some people to ears pricked up whether or not uh when a child is born with respect to the seasonal cycle impacts that child there there are a lot of data around this MH it depends on um the environment in which one lives so closer to the Equator yeah it's very different situation the equal day is all day long there were some data and I'd love to get an update on this so um somebody knows they can put in the comments that you know that schizophrenia was far more um prevalent As you move away from the equator and then there was a guy at Caltech he has since passed but had um some interesting data about mothers who contracted influenza during a certain phase of the second trimester heightened probability for schizophrenic Offspring but big big caveat here none of it was was causal of course and then there are all sorts of interesting things about you know uh placental effects and and so there's there it's a multivariable thing and we know that because identical twins even that share the same cionic sack right uh one can be schizophrenic and the other no although there is a higher concordance than if say they're in different they're a dichorionic two two different uh sacks so but time of birth relative to the seasons sure seasons correlating of course with abundance or lack of food abundance or lack of um various infectious diseases influenza in particular these things are are relevant but we'd have to make a real big stretch to then include the effects of the planet Jupiter which is the biggest planet and is most of the mass of uh of our solar system outside of the Sun then it would be clear and you could do this test with identical twins and and and that are identical versus fraternal twins twins that are raised with the same parent you know some are separated at Birth and they they they turn out very much more similarly when they're identical twins ver so shows that genetics play more of a role than we like to think jeans jeans are powerful they are I realize this is a a bit um Politically Incorrect to say in certain venues but genes are extremely powerful yeah why wouldn't they be right yeah absolutely I mean nurture matters as well are immensely powerful so and I think that that gives us hope you know people say well you know we're we're we should not be so hoty we should not be so arrogant you know we we have what uh 50% of the same uh chromosomes as a fruit flly you know like who are you to be and I I say I'll do you one better like I think some bonobos have 98% similarity but that should give us more you know sort of like treat ourselves and think of ourselves in a way that's more you know you know more elevated I would say cuz we're not that there's many species of chimpanzees and primates and so there's only one human you know Homo Sapien which you know a lot of people don't know the the word you know homo sapan which is our species and our genus um sapen doesn't mean it doesn't mean knowledge like science cenia means knowledge sapience means wisdom and I like to look atmology I'm fascinated by it but it kind of highlights what we should be doing and what what is it that we are aware of I mean I I'm curious have you ever encountered like why are we called know humans that like the wise hominid and it's because we're the only entity organism that knows it's going to die yes there's some elephants that you know before the one dies the one will take care it's not the same as like you knew you were going to die when you were a kid very young and it's that awareness of death and the awareness of how special we are I think that's what invests life with a lot more meaning I don't want to get too philosophical time perception it's that's exactly I'm an expert on happiness sitting here and and then Morgan howo is an expert on the relationship between psychological happiness and money sitting here and he described this uh cartoon which inevitably makes me chuckle of a guy and his dog sitting by a lake and the there's a bubble you know sort of bubbles coming out of the guy's head and and he's thinking about whatever his his stock portfolio and things back home Etc and out of the dog's head is just a mirror image of him sitting with his owner the dogs are very present but what that also means is that they are not able to perceive their own existence within within modeling of time as you said before we can forecast we that's how we we don't have the strongest muscles the sharpest claws the biggest teeth right what do we have we have this frontal prefrontal cortex that allows us to uh to do what are called gunan or thought experiments Einstein said um to predict the future to model the future not really predict it we can't do that but we can model likely outcomes and we can simulate in our minds what those would be like and we're so dependent on that skill that we sometimes confuse you know correlation for causation and as you know everyone who confuses coration with causation ends up dying so it's very dangerous to it's very dangerous to do that uh but but the point is the notion of what's called confirmation bias is prevalent in every human being scientist or not and in fact as scientists you and I we have to guard against that more than anybody because nothing really feels better than like thinking of a hypothesis modeling the future and then feeling like you're right and then you get celebrated and FedEd maybe you went a golden medallion with Alfred nobel's image on it or whatever those kinds of things are very powerful and those kinds of things are also very dangerous which is why it appeals to so many more people to think that the celestial orbs play a role in our lives it's almost like we've reverted to a paganistic existence where we want to believe there's some some Force responsible for our Fates when when maybe it's random on I totally agree with you I'll play devil's advocate for a moment not for astrology per se but uh for instance there are many species that use Magneto reception they can sense magnetic fields I think turtles do this some migrating birds do this some pigeons there's even some evidence that within the I believe this is still true um that within the eye of the fly the fruit fly that there are some Magneto receptors um so it turns out there are some humans that perform better than chance in a Magneto reception perceptual task yeah you know this is um very surprising to me it can be trained up somewhat but I'm sure there are a number of people hearing this that they M El feel that they can sense magnetic fields there is a capacity to do that greater than chance in some individuals it's a very weak capacity yeah so I think humans love the idea that there's something um skills or um uh qualities beyond our reflexive understanding that we all Harbor this idea that we have superpowers that we just need to tap into sixense you six sense or this person has a stroke and suddenly is speaking conversational French and therefore you know neuroplastic I ities you know Etc or what's it pro perception or um our colleague when you were at San Diego um R Chandra Ram yeah like um the synesthesia right certainly synesthesia exists people who will hear certain key on the piano and immediately evokes the the uh the perception of of a particular color not not just red but a particular shade of red in a very consistent way now if that was useful for something maybe it is useful I mean might cross unusual crossmodal plasticity is what we would call it yeah but so could could that not be you know made into an argument well that means that there that this is a general feature that we just don't know how to access but maybe like we could go to the uh we could go to the gym and and you know mental gym or do something to enhance that like you said I don't know some people do that with like infrared near infrared wavelengths that they do some kind of training and they claim they can see certain things um the question is how useful is it and then how how predictive is it and I don't think that we can make a case for the you know predictive elements of the position as I said of Mars and Mercury being in retrograde as it is now like most but the thing that's shocking is that like look there's there's a whole page in almost every newspaper except the excur bable New York time no I'm just kidding that New York Times uh does still around they uh it's it's very interesting I'll tell you off the air recent recent uh encounter I've had with the New York Times but but um but most newspapers have more you know 10 hundreds of times more ink written about astrology than astronomy I mean it's barely it'll barely be in there and why is that it's capitalistic Society so people are you know crave this notion that there's some explanation for the random seeming events that occur in their lives and that's an urge as ancient as you know human civilization itself I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 200 12 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong wrong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only January 2025 ag1 is giving away 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again go to drink a1.com huberman to claim the 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 it speaks to what I think is one of the core functions of the human brain which you know uh umbrella is everything we're talking about which is the human brain is a prediction making machine and it wants to make predictions on the basis of things that feel reliable and the ability for us to well confirmation bias the ability for us to link a and t as opposed to a b c and work through things linearly and try and disprove our own hypothesis is much stronger than any um desire to work through things systematically unless you're trained as a scientist exactly Y and so it's no surprise to me that people um want to understand themselves and understand others in a way that uh feels at least semi-reliable and to do that in a way where they don't have to run a ton of experiments and uh hence hence astrology I'd like to um stay within this vein of thought but you said something earlier that's been kind of you know um nagging in the back of my brain you said we have two refracting telescopes in the front of our skull um I will often remind people that your retinas that line the back of your eyes like a like a pie crust are part of your brain your central nervous system that was literally squeezed out of your skull during the first trimester through a whole genetic program that's very beautiful and this might freak you out but think about it this is the only portion of your brain that resides outside the cranial Vault yeah technically still in your skull but outside the cranial Vault gives humans an enormous capacity that they wouldn't have otherwise because what you can make judgments about space and time space based on what's next to what what's far from what and time based on movement of things relative to stationary objects Etc that we wouldn't otherwise be able to perform right you could sense odors at a distance smoke Etc but it's a whole other business to have these two telescopes could you explain what you mean by two refracting telescopes because I think that will set the stage nicely for some of our other discussion about Optics yeah so I've in love with telescope since the you know age of about 12 when I could first afford one to buy one of my own and and that really came out of the fact that I recognize the limitations of the human eye it turned out I was 12 years old woke up in the middle of the night one night there was this incredibly bright light you know brighter than these lights here shining into my room and I was like where I don't know there's a street light outside it's is crazy let me look outside and see what it is and it was the moon and I had never seen it was near near moonet which is near Sunrise full moon and I looked at it and I kept staring at it and there was a star next to it that kind of looked like a piece of the Moon had broken off it was that bright and that clear and it's unusual to see these kinds of things together they're actually known as sizes which is a great great uh Scrabble word if you're ever you know pressed for for a win in Scrabble use the word siy I think it's like 80 points um and that just means a conjunction an alignment of astronomical objects I was like what the hell is this this is 1984 Andrew you know you're younger than me but but Google did not exist for another 16 years and I I was kind of impatient I wanted to know what this thing was what is this thing it's not moving it's not flashing it's not a drone you know back then it's not a it's not Southwest Airlines right so I'm looking at it it's not moving and day after day it was like that and I was like what how am I going to find this out like imagine exist we're so blessed that we have the internet and we have these llms it's so easy now to be a scientists or do research and anybody can do research science is for everybody right you always highlight that fact so I realized the only way to find out about it was to wait for the New York Times to get delivered on Sunday because they did have a section back then that they don't have now called Cosmos and in it depicted what the night sky looked like that night which is a Sunday and that was like three or four days after what you know I had this observation which you know was incredibly uh you know observant uh and I looked at it and it was the Moon it showed the moon and it showed Jupiter I was like what you can see a planet with your naked eye this was around the time Voyager you know was going by the planets on The Grand Tour of the solar system never been done before I was like I thought you needed a spaceship you know and and I realized that was my first bit of astronomical research you know I looked up I had a hypothesis what is it I was wrong I thought it was a star it was a planet I was like this is insane you know imagine what I could see if I had a telescope but but I couldn't afford a telescope we were pretty modest means back then I had a job working at a delicate test in down the street and I do that once a week and then you know I got a grant from a three-letter agency you know which is the beginning of many many scientist careers I got a grant from the mom agency my mother she supplemented my $2 an hour salary at the Venice delicatessan in dobs Ferry and I ended up getting a telescope for $75 and I you know cherish this thing and and then I was like oh let me look at these things in the sky and it's pretty amazing uh I I don't know if you know the history of telescopes but the first ones were invented because of uh the the glass that was present to make eyeglasses so telescopes came from eyeglasses where was the Best glasses where were the Best glasses made in the Netherlands so actually the telescope and the microscope were both invented in Holland and the guy who invented the telescope was is very interesting because it would be like he he made the telescope but he never thought to look at the at the night sky with it he only used it as a spy glass to look at objects you know on the horizon or in a city or whatever he never went like this looked up you know 45 that required Galileo so he's my absolute hero of all of science we'll talk about him later maybe um Galileo was the first person to ever look up with this telescope and spot objects in the solar system in the universe that had never been seen before with a scientific tool so everybody had to use their eyes and back to TI brah Kepler cernus they had to use their eyes which are telescopes I'll get back to that don't worry um I I know you afford me the podcaster you know predilection of of going off on long tangents but I think this is good um Galileo then said well I'm going to take this telescope and look at these objects that are otherwise look like stars and in fact we're called you know basically Wanderers because they're only things that moved first looked at the moon now take yourself back to 16009 when he was first looking at these objects 1609 there were no clocks there are no scientific tools of any any real virtue uh he in fact would invent many of these things there were simple things like a magnetic compass a slide rule which nobody you know known in your main demographic will not a slide rul is but that's okay um very simple tools um you know they would use tubes and whatnot but Galileo looked at the moon and the hypotheses was everything in the universe is orbiting around the earth the earth is the most perfect place in the universe because God puts the things that are most important close to him than center of the universe God is the center of the universe the Catholic Church held this and everything will go around the earth and in fact I I'm not going to challenge you because I I I I think you'll defeat me in this in this but in your audience there probably very many educated I call them edu people there's many many educated people I find that even with my brilliant students at UCSD they can't prove that the Earth is not the center of the solar system in other words I'll say on my astronomy 101 quiz I'll say prove that the Earth is is the uh is not the center of the solar system which was the whole universe back then right and I would say it's about 75 80% will not get it right in fact I can say to most people proof the Earth is not flat I claim the Earth is flat prove me wrong most people can't prove it they don't know how the proof is constructed I don't expect them to go and replicate what arist darkus did you know 2,000 years ago but this is knowledge we've had for two as I said 2,000 years the knowledge that the earth goes around the Sun and not the other way around is only about 400 years old but I would say 99% I know for a fact I went to Italy actually uh 10 years ago it was the 100th anniversary of Einstein's theory of general relativity and they we had a ceremony to honor the first person who ever came up with a theory of relativity which is also Galileo Galileo had the first notion that relative motion is indistinguishable that if you and I are on a bike and I'm stationary you can't tell if you're moving I can't tell if I'm stationary that's called relativity of motion it's not motion is not absolute Einstein would later enhance that you know put on steroids and then come up with all sorts of cool stuff that we can get into but um but this notion that you could do observations that you could use a scientific tool couple with a hypothesis and then iterate on those hypotheses to make both the instrument better and your hypothesis better and then expose that to Scientific peer review which was not what we have today that was done by Galileo he was the first person to use the scientific method what did he use it with a telescope so a telescope that he used was a refracting telescope lenses like eyeglasses two of them one put at the far end called The Objective it's closer to the object the other one the iPie is close to your eye and he was able to magnify things about 3 to 10 times pretty easily can you explain refraction for people that that yeah are not when light light is the light travels at the fastest speed um of any entity you know photons travel at uh roughly 300,000 kilometers per second uh except when they go into a medium that's what they travel in in in the vacuum of space or in a vacuum in my laboratory or whatever but when they go into a medium that's uh transparent or translucent uh they slow down the you can you can think of it as the light waves themselves imagine uh light waves as rows of soldiers marching together and then uh imagine that they're walking at an angle to to the beach here in in Los Angeles they're marching at an angle the ones that encounter the water first they start to slow down the other ones keep moving at a fast speed and then the whole beam of light the whole beam of soldiers gets bent that process is called refraction we can do it well this yber mate is so delicious we can't do it because it's it's got a little bit of cloud to it similar to for instance if you go and uh look at a fountain and you see a coin and you decide you know you're going to be that mischievous kid and you're going to grab that coin so you can throw it back in like any uh you can you can recycle the wish um and you reach down to grab it and you miss because where you see it is not where it actually is yeah put a pencil in a clear glass of water same phenomenon will happen that's refraction it's the bending of light by what's called a dialectric or just a medium that's transparent or translucent and uh you can do that in a way that you shape the wave of light coming in that it will be magnified and that's in fact what a telescope does t means distance scope means viewer so a telescope really means distance viewer a microscope means small thing viewer and so this was kind of revolutionary to use it for scientific purposes Galia did other things we just take these for granted we got all these cool cameras here these are all refracting telescopes you can see the lens in one you can see that it's on a tripod Galileo invented the tripod we take these things for granted but people didn't realize that what a stud yeah I want to get a list of all the things that the Galileo did I I'm going to pause you for one second and I please um earmark where you're at because um I have a number of questions that I just can't resist asking fine first of all if it's too lengthy an answer feel free to say you know pass but uh why was the best glass in um in Holland what what is it about the Dutch and and good glass I think that they were extremely as they are now I have great colleagues that are that are from the Netherlands um they were obsessed with with um high quality as as Germans are you know there very similar to Germans uh very uh into very precise instrumentation and high quality uh it's interesting to note that the uh that glasses were only really invented in some sense um because of the fact that there was an existing standard for human visual Acuity okay so we we all know we go to the eye eyasses ey glasses yeah so we know today that when you go to the eye doctor there's an eye chart right and we all SN it's called the Snelling chart SN chart when you go to the DMV they you use the same thing numbers and letters of different sizes that at a given distance if you can read all of them then you have whatever High let's just say high Acuity Vision we won't get into we won't get into yeah uh and if you can only read you know three lines down and then you're essentially um blind to the rest then you have less than average vision and in the state of California they'll still give you a driver's license there are many people bu there are many people driving in the United States by the way who qualify as legally blind because when you drive you mainly use your peripheral vision they are granted a driver's license this this should terrify everybody but all those ey charts every DMV here has the exact same size for the e at the top okay it's a calibration standard how could they do that 400 years ago we're talking 430 years ago turns out there was one and only one standard that was acceptable across all of Western Europe it was the Gutenberg Bible the Gutenberg Bible was set in print by Gutenberg and it had a fixed size of all the characters so what they would do is at a couple of feet they put the the gudenberg Bible in front of people it's amazing to think about it because there's only like 10 copies of the gudenberg Bible still left they're all in vaults they're all worth hundreds of millions of dollars you you can't buy them even if you're you know Elon um when you look at it you would be able to tell that you could not see at one foot what I could not see what Andrew could see at one foot so you knew that there was something diminishing my visual Acuity whether who knows what it was but they knew that they could then correct that lens to be as good as 20 or you know get up to your standard for me and that was the way that they would judge how good your eyes were and so they then would correct that with lenses and I always point out how ironic it is because later on Galileo would take those two lenses and instead of putting one on each eye he put one in front of the other one and then use that to construct a telescope he didn't he didn't actually invent the telescope but he perfected the telescope so just like apple didn't invent the smartphone they perfected it just like Facebook didn't invent social networking they perfected it right so it's it's usually the second mouse gets the cheese they like to say he was the ultimate second mouse he would always improve things and make them so much better that he would obliterate his competition but it was cernus if I'm not mistaken that was the first to say that the Earth revolves around the sun while rotating on its axis and tilts which gives us the Equinox correct yes okay so Galileo corrected cernus about the math but it was cernus that um that gave us the first like trusted statement that the earth and the other planets rotate around the sun yeah he I would say he gave the hypothesis he wasn't he wasn't wrong Gallo didn't correct him it just Galileo brought evidence to the table he brought hard scientific observ who this cernus guy was he just sort of like a iconic class he's like hey how about we're not the center of the universe it's the sun that's the center of universe so what was the Milo of the time was that um the Earth was the center of the of the universe which was our solar system effectively was the whole universe they didn't know about stars and Galaxy certainly we can get into that later uh but there was what's known as the talic um concept of the organization of the cosmos so the earliest cosmological models were that the sun is the center of the earth is the center of the universe and everything goes around it however these were not dopes they knew that there were problems with that model there are certain aspects of of the of the orbits of Planets For example I mentioned Mercury's retrograde and what what does retrograde mean we don't have to get into it but there are anomalies that the planets will undergo at different times of the year uh due to the fact that the Earth is we know now Ro rotating revolving around the Sun and rotating on its axis but the main effect is its revolution around the Sun and the other planets are to in the same plane the Zodiac plane the What's called the ecliptic due to the angular momentum of the Proto solar system and sometimes the earth goes faster than say Jupiter so originally it'll be out in front if you will of the planet you know forward Center of motion as you'd like to say and then it'll be behind it later on and so it looks like the Jupiter is making like this weird scurve and they couldn't explain that if the Earth is the center of the solar system except that they added on what are called epicycles they added on extra Little Orbits of the planets in order to account for that motion that sometimes it appears yes we're moving bulk motion but then sometimes it goes in opposite direction when we're going in the same direction so smart yeah they and they must have known by modeling this stuff on Earth between objects on Earth and that raises for me anyway uh an important psychological question so you you've got um these Dutch folks with Great Glass yeah they're using that great glass to correct vision I should say uh sorry Andre the reason that they had good glass is they were the some of the foremost um uh uh explorers right a lot of the early uh trade and they were uh what did exploration give them access to trade so they could get the finest silicon and glass and they could make it themselves that's their economics again capitalism always wins right this is a lesson that we shouldn't forget their Commerce their economies allowed them to do trade and get acquire the best highest quality materials then that was used to make the best scientific equipment and it's just curious it' be like you know if we they built these scientific tools but they didn't use them for science so imagine like building the large hron collider or or slack or something like that and and then not using it you know just like using it to like measure slack is sitting empty right basically but it wasn't originally that's the point right it was used for something so I so I what I'm curious about is why do you think it is that some humans get some technology in this case glass yeah and they want to look at things that are very close up yeah you know that I'm I like microscopes a lot I I right now you know I don't have my wet lab we're still still involved in some clinical trials but you know I love microscopes and I love customizing my microscopes I didn't like them you know I don't like a plug-and playay I I I like them sort of the same way that people like hot rods I didn't like motorized stages I like manual stages this kind of thing nowadays you need motorize stages Etc but what was I going to invest my money into it was higher numerical aperture yes better basically you're able to see things better right exactly see see smaller things better that that's what um numerical aperture will will do for you so it's like putting more um horsepower into a car yeah as opposed to paying more attention to the you know the the paint job people do that with their cameras you know they geek out everyone's got their thing yep humans have this glass and they have the option to look at smaller and smaller things or to resolve their Vision why do you think it is that a subset of humans because I think it's a special subset of humans instead like I want to look at things really far away yeah you know and you're one of these humans I mean I Delight in the stars I Delight in the moon I have some questions about um that I think most people have who appreciate sunsets and moon sets and things like that um but why do you think it is that it tends to be a small subset of people who don't just want to appreciate the night sky but want to figure this stuff out that is so far away I'll be honest it never occurred to me I'm curious about things deep under the ocean I am very I'm very interested in fish and and Aquatic Life and but I I like terrestrial things arboreal things things and trees and um and I think most people uh Orient to the uh the stuff that's more of this planet yeah what do you think it is I I realize you're not a psychologist and there's probably no um DSM whatever six diagnosis specific for this but but is I'll I just ask you for you was it a desire to better understand life here on Earth or was it a desire to kind of leave life here on Earth I think it's a ladder I mean my my childhood was you know pretty tumultuous I think you and I have a lot things in common both fathers you know scientists and you know phys physics and math in my case um very hard driving very hard to live up to their their their Shadows that they cast for example um at least in my case um uh and and you seem to have a you know just a beautiful Rel ship with your dad now but I'm sure it wasn't always like that talked about that we did a lot of repair work and I'm very grateful for where we're at and and I encourage anyone son daughter mother father whatever relationship the the repair work to the extent that it's possible is absolutely worth it yeah and that episode you I texted you is a real gift not only you know for for all of us who got to you know witness it but also you know for grandchildren him you know his legacy and so forth and even you know his mom your your your your dad's uh wife and and your mom but but the the point is I yes it transported me I was living through after the divorce of my parents I lived with my stepfather um who had adopted us changed our names moveed to different you know we were changing you know schools every couple of years and that discovery of the you know Moon next to Jupiter it was sort of like solving a puzzle and there's a famous saying by you know Albert Michaelson who was the first Nobel Prize winner in American history um for what physics sorry Michael and Morley um he proved in some sense that the Earth is not moving through the ether you know that was hypothesized by by luminaries beforehand but but the point was when um when a child does a like solves a puzzle like you would think well like an adult you solve a Rubik's Cube okay I did it once I don't have to do it again but like my son keep doing it keep like showing off can I get it faster video game same thing once you solve the you don't just like throw it out and stop doing it you get a taste of that thrill of Discovery yes it's diminished and yes we become inured to it as we get older and and a little bit more you know there's just things we have to get you know take care of in life and especially as a professor scientist you know you can't like Marvel over the same things you did when you first did these experiments but as an experiment you get transported and you get to you know encounter something that you feel like no one has ever done before for example when I got my first telescope that night you know a couple of months after discovering this you I looked through it and I saw the same features on the moon and I have a 3D printed Moon that my son made you know to show you um and it has all the craters represented on it's so cool um and I saw the exact same craters on the moon that Galileo saw and then I looked at V at Jupiter and when you look at Jupiter you not only see these beautiful atmospheric bands on it and I brought you a telescope as your you know as your end of the year holiday gift uh it's yours to keep and no money uh no no money down and King brand for and uh and I looked at Jupiter and when you look at Jupiter as I hope you'll do tonight or with your crew later on um you will see not only the planet not only its little atmospheric Stripes maybe even the Great Red Spot which is amazing three times bigger than the earth you can see it from Earth with this little telescope I got you but you see four little stars and there four stars that are to the left to the right they're in a plane with the midpoint of these equatorial storms that are Brewing on Jupiter for four we know that they've been going on for at least 400 years because Galileo saw them so that sets a limit a m you know minimum storms when you say storms what are these stem they are enormous hurricanes on the planet and the equator bands like the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn so there's plenty of water up there that's raining down not water at all it's methane ammonia uh but it's a fluid so it behaves like a fluid doesn't so you have these swirling whirls and the colors will Amaze you you'll see colors on an astronomical object it's going to blow your mind and not only is it going to blow your mind because you're doing you're G to feel unique in all of science you will feel what Galileo felt you won't know that he felt it before you a billion people have seen it since then because for you it's new and for you you're viscerally connected to the Maestro to Galileo and what he did there's no other branch of science that's like that you can't look at the at the higs B on first of all no one person to team of 3,700 people that discovered the higs B on and seven people predicted the higs BOS on higs is just one of them one of my professors up around was another one Jer ground that he passed away unfortunately never won the no prize but but the point is you can't know what that felt like you can't know what it felt like to discover gravitation waves because thousands of people did it recently in 2015 but the question of visceral connection to the first discover of that phenomena it's Unique to astronomy I I don't know of another branch of science where you can have that and best of all from here in the center of La you can see the same craters you can see these four Galilean they're called the Galilean moons of Jupiter and uh we're sending spacecraft there now to see if they have life on it it's incredible Andrew there's nothing else like that in all of science for $50 to $60 have a list on my website Brian king.com I have a telescope buyer guide that I sent to people I don't make any money from it it's just I love to share science with the public just like you but in my case it's astronomy and for $50 or $75 you can have this experience that Galileo had it's it's an awesome feeling and I think that's what kept me going it distracted me from the the Pains of you know the life that I had at that time and you know just struggling as most pre-teens and teenagers did um you know but uh to answer your question that you asked 20 minutes ago it was really to to transport teleport exactly the opposite of the telescope I really felt like I was transported to these other worlds and I could that I could understand them with simple math and simple tools night after night they were reliable Companions and that people love to see it you'll see Saturn hopefully with it you can't help but feel this is you know amazing it's thrilling and it allows you to do science with your eyes connected to your mind it's it's incredible so it sounds to me like you were thank you for sharing that by the way the way it sounds like you were able to connect to places distant in space obviously yeah and time yeah Galileo that's beautiful I I don't think the same experience occurs when one looks down the microscope I it's true that the the greatest neurobiologist of all time by a long shot um was Ramon kahal right Supernatural levels of ability to understand what turned out to be the correct function of the nervous system just from anatomical specimens but when I look down the microscope and I see a even a kahal rsus cell there's a cell named after uh after him um you don't really feel a connection to him in the same way although that the neurons are beautiful but you don't it's not the same the way that you describe what's great about science in general is that the best science is apolitical but I always say look there's no such thing as like oh that constellation is a democratic constellation oh you see that asteroid that's a rep no it's it's a it is a safe space I think we do need safe spaces and at best science is a safe space not meaning it never interacts with politics because of course it does but but for those moments we we as humans and you know this better than I do we need to we need recovery you can't just work out you don't work out seven days a week you work out six days a week or whatever it's still more than six more than I work out but but the point is we need to recover as much as we need to pay attention to to to the activity we need to recover pay attention to that too um and so the question is where can we recover from social media from politics from economic stress and all I think science is an ideal vehicle for it it should be apolitical we shouldn't be you know always concerned with you know politics or what's happening on social media and I'm guilty of this too I'm I'm you know certainly spending way too much time on screens but but the point being science can be that and astronomy in particular like I said it's apolitical it is safe to let your mind run to what you used to do when you were on a dorm with your Bros at you know 3:00 a.m. just bsing right we don't get a chance to do that when you're thinking about mortgage payments and like who's taking the kids tomorrow and and all these different you know quotidian things as I say we need to get back to that more more than ever I feel pondering the origins of life and connecting to people um who existed thousands of years before us that's right do you think that Galileo cernus um and others were doing the exact same thing that there were there was a bit of an escapism to it healthy escapism as opposed to trying to solve the the position of the plets and and understand ourselves um for some other reason definitely yeah I mean Gallo in particular is sort of this tragic figure in some ways you know he he had the first Notions and application of the scientific method as I said using an apparatus to confirm a hypothesis iterating on that so I said when he saw the moon he saw these craters and valleys and Rifts and lava fields that you'll see tonight again people you can buy a telescope on Amazon $50 and you'll see the same things that he saw and you can connect it to your iPhone and post it on Instagram if you want and I hope you'll do that that's your only homework assignment the only one I'm going to assign to you as a professor so I want you to take a picture of uh the craters on the moon but the point is you'll see the exact same things from New York City you can see them from the middle of London it doesn't matter where you are if you have a clear sky and the moon is out you'll see the same thing but when you look at Jupiter you'll see these four dots and here's where Galileo just had this otherworldly intellect that you know when I saw those I was like oh cool it's next to some star until I realized I had to do more research that those are actually the moons of Jupiter so in one night tonight you can you know quadruple the number of moons you've ever seen in your life and some of those moons are almost the size of our moon arm moon is unusually large um and and those moons sometimes they'll cast Shadows on the planet so there'll be an eclipse you'll witness an eclipse on Jupiter on another planet with this $50 instrument or whatever okay um when he was observing these things he would would do things that were not only Psych iCal and they were therapeutic for him in his later years I'll explain that in a minute he ended up going blind and and so losing the sight you know kind of the Recollections that he had and he lost his daughter who was a nun because he was she was illegitimate as most of I think all of his kids except maybe one oldest one he had Mistresses he was never he was married divorced basically and I was kind of like he was Catholic in Italy Pro you know primordial Italy basically it didn't exist as a country but he was in Tuscany and uh he had a lot of challenges he was almost always broke broke even when he invented the his version of the telescope again he didn't invent the telescope but he made it so much better 10x it 20x it you know zero to one and it was incredible what he did with it he realized I this is great and all for me to discover these cool things and learn about the universe he was deeply religious too um but I got to make money I got to pay for my house he had like Bard imagine like your students at Stanford are living with you because that's the only way you can afford to pay rent in your I mean and you're cooking meals for them and they're like slobs right I mean like I was a slob in in college right so the point is he had bills to pay and he was a businessman he realized well look if I if I start making these telescopes everybody will see the things that I'm seeing I won't have any monopolistic advantage over you know Kepler who is his friend but also his competitor um they were they were you know really V vying for for who is the best astronomer of all time Kepler in Germany and and obviously Galo in Italy well become Italy and um and he realized Kepler was purely theoretical he had great math chops he came up with functions for the orbits of planets before Isaac Newton proved that they came from calculus and universal gravitation incredible scientist but if he gave that it was like giving a you know a free particle accelerator to your arch competitors right he didn't do that he said no I'm not going to make these telescopes but I'm gonna I'm GNA sell them only to the government and they're going to pay me because these are great military devices and you don't we don't think of them now but with it he went he's so brilliant he was so charming and charismatic he said I'm not I'm not only going to like sell you these things first he went to the senate in in Venice the Venetian Senate the Doge the original Doge we think doge is a coin or some Department that elon's GNA head no no it was the Doge was like the the the the chief of the government back in the venetians which was one of the most wealthy countries in all of all of Europe it was separate from Tuscany and separate from Rome and he went there and he said uh you are a maritime Pro you have you ever been to Venice mhm it's beautiful right so he said look come with me I'm going to take you up into the Piaza San Marco go up to the tower and we're going to look out and we're going to see there's a ship out there but you can't see it with your naked eye but if I give you the telescope you can see it three days earlier before it comes into your Harbor that's like you have an F35 you know stealth fighter and you you sell the rights to turn off the stealth portion of it to your adversary it's incredibly valuable it's a time portal yes you know you can tell I'm keep harping on this theme of you know the ability to see things at greater distance that's right uh at higher and higher resolution gives you a a window into time exactly and we that now that um has enormous Advantage there there because of you know the trajectory of the ship you actually are getting a a sort of crystal ball into the into what's going to happen later the future whereas looking at at position of the Stars some anticipation of of what's going to happen based on historical charts of the stars and we can speak of that now and I come to think of it as you're saying it light years what is a lightyear it's a measurement of distance but it's in terms of time so it's exactly what consonant with what you're saying we we are always going to have this combination and this interrelation this this you know uh competition between things in space and things in time and he realized with this tube that he could see to Great distances that also afforded him this extra Advantage when it came to predicting the future as you say if we could do a top Contour survey of the greats of astronomy um where would it start starting with who people who got it wrong yeah and then we and then correct each other like we if we were going to do a fast uh a fast Sprint through these yeah uh where would we start well you'd have to start with like you know Gog or whatever you know the first cavemen and women you know as I said the 40 charting stars on the wall exactly we don't know who they are telling their their youngsters like okay you know because those stars are there relative to that Ridge or that Etc days are getting longer days are getting shorter that's right ergo hunt now Ergo collect stuff to hunker down um maybe even um don't reprodu now maybe even behavioral restraint 100% maybe reproduce now yeah yeah it's going to be much more you know optimal time for exactly so tens of thousands pre- Antiquity you would say then the I would say fast forward you know to the maybe uh Egyptian Epoch you know 5,000 BC so to speak when they had a also a very uh zodicalcandy that's I think it's less controversial Stonehenge than the pyramids the pyramids seem to be like almost you know they lead people into thinking about aliens and all what what do you think of is it I mean given their their mass given their location given what we knew about populations then and given what we know about the strength of people and the tools they had at the time is it reasonable to assume that people built these things I I mean certainly I mean you'd have to convince me that people didn't build them but exactly how they built it is is is a great question I mean so for example I mentioned this when I was on Joe Rogan's show I said you know if you measure the bases of the pyramids it turns out that there a ratio of a cubit which is uh actually cubits not Quantum bits like you and your dad talked about but but uh cubits is the length of the pharaoh's forearm it's basically a foot and a half roughly so back then if you were like the president you were also the metric standard for all of civilization wild it makes it's sort of like uh models on Instagram right everyone's trying to attain these what's the standard that's right exactly wow so the phoh forearm is this and is this about carrying carrying items yeah well was just for length or like a foot we talk about a foot it was a Pharaoh's foot yeah that's where we get those from right so there was only kind of one rough standard for calibration which is incredibly important for removing systematic effects in science in general so you had a calibration standard now we have like a bar of platinum we've defined you know the second in terms of oscillations of a of a certain atom called cesium and how many times it Ates per per second sure a degree right yeah a calorie right so now we want to define those in terms of physical quantities not in terms of people um and so doing that has has been a great Advance forward in science and we've only recently gotten rid of what are called artifacts so it used to be there was a rod that was one meter long and the meter was originally defined as um 69,000 I I forget of the distance from the North Pole to Paris but that obviously depends on assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere which it's not right chubby around the middle yeah right bulg is because it's it's an oblate Spirit right exactly um and so all these things that were relics uh we want to get rid of them and tie them to fundamental properties of say a Quantum system that's very pure and we can isolate it we don't want to use a Pharaoh's foot either so we we have to come with a link standard so now we use the speed of light times the second and we can Define things in those terms but back then yeah so they didn't know that but I told Joe as I said if you measure the base of all the the Great Pyramids of Giza they're all multip of a cubit uh times so many numbers of the number Pi so like but Pi wasn't known to them you know Pi wasn't known to be irrational until the Greeks um in uh in uclid proved that it was irrational um uh and that you know it didn't come from a computational it couldn't easily be obtained from it it had an infinite number of digits right so how did these Egyptians know that an alien told them no the way they did it is they laid it out they used a surveyor tool one of the surveyor tool is a stick with a on it so the wheel's a circle so you got so many multiples they just counted and that's how so we confuse a lot of things they stumbled into Pi exactly right they walked all over so you don't have to always posit Supernatural explanations for things the answer is simply we don't know I certainly don't know how Stone engine was built nor how do I know how the pyramids were built um but it's not you would have to convince me that it was built by some other means other than people and the tools that were available to them likewise I'm not I'm not convinced it came from extraterrestrial I don't remember how we got on this but um so we were marching through so we were marching through um so we have the our ancient ancestors and then what point did we get to um kernus in Gala uh then it was uh yeah then it was cernus who had ideas but couldn't prove them he had no data to substantiate the capern or sun centered model of the universe which is also by the way you know almost everything in science is wrong right cernic is wrong the sun is not the center of the solar system right there there's the center of our solar system is inside the sun because the planets orbit around it and they orbit around an elliptical pattern which has two fosi so he belied that the the orbits were all circles so he's wrong but he's more right than Aristotle so that's why science progresses right Newton was right about gravity until uh he was wrong when Einstein proved him wrong right so then you come up to um after him Kepler discovered the laws of the elliptical motion of planets and um and and their patterns that we still use we discovered an exoplanet my my colleague David Kipping I want to introduce you to to uh he's discovered exomoons these are moons around other planets some of which are in the habitable zone of their host star and some of them have sun-like stars and are earth-sized planets it's incredible there could be as I said a link between life evolving on Earth due to the moon on our planet so too on an exoplanet it could require an exomoon which he's discovered or thinks he has he's actually very cautious and hasn't said it explicitly so Kepler's laws underpin all those discoveries even to this day 400 years later then Galileo immediately afterwards with the telescope phases of Venus uh that only occur if the Earth is not the center of the solar system the rings of Saturn he he had Notions about those he accidentally discovered the planet Neptune it's amazing um and then he uh of course the moons of Jupiter falsified the notion that the Earth is the center of the solar system because these moons are going around Jupiter not around the earth so that's completely torpedoed the notion of the true nature of the Aristotelian or t uh Earth centered cosmology then uh soon after that uh astronomers measured things like the speed of light um using eclipses of the moons of Jupiter uh they measured distances to Saturn they they mapped out the solar system and then from there using Parallax you know you can kind of gauge the triangulation and using trigonometry measure the structure of our galaxy uh William hersel and his uh sister Caroline hsel was the first uh female astronomer first female scientist she was the first person to use the scientific method did and become a fellow of the Royal Society in in Great Britain um and then later off after that we come to the era of the the last you know kind of U the big developments in technology were photographic plates after that spectrographs dispersion of light onto photographic material you could preserve your memory you didn't use sketches like Galileo did and then up until Hubble when Hubble discovered two major things which was one was that the Milky Way was a Galaxy it wasn't the entire universe there were other galaxies Island universes of billions of stars and then he discovered the expansion of the universe with help from astronomer who doesn't get a lot of attention a lot of the women in astronomy uh got really short shrift um people discovered how Fusion works in the sun women Carol um g gapas spaan at Harvard and then Henrietta levit um who who measured this relationship between the size and brightness of objects called seiad variables that Hubble then used to make his law that proved that the universe is expanding and then after that people like penes and Wilson discovering the uh microwave and radio astronomy Robert jansky all the way up until you know my colleagues today some of them I've interviewed um Adam Ree and and Brian Schmidt and uh Barry barish he wrote the forward to my my second book um detecting gravitational waves the accelerating expansion of the universe due to Dark Energy first Nobel Prize in astronomy 2011 uh followed up 2015 discovery of 2017 discovered gravitational waves from inspiring black hole you know there's so many and there's so many you I've been blessed to know many of them and I have them as my academic you know pedigree I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabol function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over a 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from to doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor inform formed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft that mattress is or How firm it is how breathable it is all play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs so if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz that asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress D us I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about three and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had so much so that when I travel to hotels and airbnbs I find I don't sleep as well I can't wait to get back to my dusk mattress so if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com take that 2-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's customized for your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get up to 25% off maybe you can help me here I've never heard a description of the of the origin of life in the universe that made a lot more sense to me past there were a bunch of big explosions a bunch of the elements and stuff that you needed uh came together and then uh at some point there was water and at some point there were Critters that moved and then multicellular organisms like what am I missing here I mean I'm I'm a I'm a I'm a man of science and I love science but why can't I can grasp it when it's told to me but why is it that um it's so hard maybe I'm just not smart enough to comprehend this idea that a bunch a star exploded dot dot dot and here we are I think it's obvious why why you have this particular Affliction and that's because you're used to doing experiment you're a scientist your core identity one of your core identities is a scientist right and you think of things scientifically and as I said before the Scientific Method as we practice it is based on you know hypothesis observation experimentation iteration right well think about this if I study if I have a hypothesis that um you know that certain people can um can detect sunspots right so I want to have a control group and I want to have a variable right so I want to be able to contrast and see if it's statistically significant right I want to pack right so what do I have to do then well I have to control the number of sunspots okay sorry I'm not you know you used to say you weren't around at the creation you know the design meeting for human beings I wasn't consulted at the design phas and by the way when Brian says pcking packing is people tinkering with the numbers or the experiment or the hypothesis after the data are in in order to try and establish statistical significance which and by the way p is isid not just not good it's bad it's it's it's cheating of a uh it's not making up data but it's tweaking the experimental design um in hopes that you'll get something where you probably didn't it's not good you don't want to do it your colleague at Stanford weo ens won the Nobel prize in economics in 2021 and he's done tremendous amount of work in this and you know confounding variables pcking where do these things manifest themselves in physics well high temperature super conductors this goes back to the late 80 I remember graduating from high school there was a discovery of room temperature what's called cold fusion that was one thing that create also Limitless energy too cheap to meter from just using hydrogen and from seawater and Palladium uh and platinum um that turned out to be bogus and it turned out to be the data were manipulated in such a way that we would say probably fall into the realm of pcking which may not have been maliciously intended but the goal the output of it is certainly you know a driving in that influences people to do things that are unethical and and that happens at all levels and we we saw I saw it in my own experiment um not necessarily accusing my colleagues of being unethical we were searching and we still are searching for what caused the Big Bang we're going to get back to your question of how this comes because I think I can I can help that plate still spinning in the backgound like a planet it's spinning like our solar system right uh but the um the the the Quarry was so big to unravel what caused the Big Bang to what ignited the spark that became our universe it's at least it was called when we announced the Discovery at Harvard um on on uh St Patrick's Day 2014 uh world news covered a front page everywhere New York Times Sienna every single outlet covered it it was called one of the greatest discoveries of all time not only did it uh explain how our universe came into existence it also predicted the existence of other universes and what's called the Multiverse which we've heard about maybe in Quantum Computing most people heard on the joog exactly right that's right among many things that we hear about only on that show so the the point is um it was it was an a quarry for the ages and I knew that because that's why I invented the experiment right I told you my father and I you know we never really had the reproach mon that you and your father seem to have had and that's great um we always had kind of a difficult relationship as I said he abandoned me in my book I write about this rather um he abanded me and my older brother Kevin at I was seven he was 10 and he you know just left us and because of that he didn't end up you know paying child support for me or my my brother and alimony to my mother and so my stepfather adopted us and my last name was originally not keing it was axe ax um and so uh when we adopted I never saw him I didn't see him for 15 years but I knew one thing he was uh a brilliant scientist and he was actually the youngest he was he was not only a 10e professor he was full Professor with like a chair at Cornell at age 26 so you and I got our professor like our 30s or whatever I was 40 when I got tenure yeah I mean it's it's like a much he was 26 2 it was a math it was a little bit different but I knew he won basically there's no Nobel Prize in mathematics there's the fields medal which is kind of equivalent at some level but almost nobody knows about it it's only given every five years you have to be under 40 whatever he never won that but he won like the prize just beneath that if you will called the cold PR um a remarkable scientist got into incredible discoveries in mathematics and physics and I knew one thing he never won the Noble Prize so as some kids might compete with their father who's a you know captain of the high school football team and they want to be the captain of the college foot very competitive boys can be competitive with their Dads right you know that and I want to compete with him but he wasn't an athlete I wasn't an athlete I can compete with him and do what he could not do which was win a Nobel Prize and I was arange from him and I was like I'm going to win a Nobel Prize and I'll show him you know and he'll regret that he abandoned me and gave me up for adoption this is my thought Pro I'm not I'm not saying it's like the most elevated way to be but that's the way I thought of it so I said I have to invent something discover something that's worthy of a prize that's all I have to do quote unquote how hard can it be there's been hundreds of Nobel prizes given out these that's the way you thought about I was at Stanford and you're surrounded by Noble you know what it's like I was a postto at Stanford uh for a short time we can get into that and uh and and the point was I was obsessed with discovering or inventing an experiment that could take us back to the primordial Universe before what we call the big bang the Big Bang is not the origin of time and space it's the origin of the first elements in the periodic table of the element we still don't know what caused that event to occur and I realized that if we discovered what caused that event to occur which is hypothesized uh to be uh a phenomenon called inflation which was co-created by uh uh at least three scientists but but two of whom were at Stanford associate with Stanford Alan Guth who's now at MIT he was a postto at slack and Andre Lind who's a you know renowned professor at at Stanford to this day so uh they predicted that there was this mysterious substance called a Quantum field and that the fluctuations in this Quantum field existing in a four-dimensional Infinite Space uh the random fluctuations of a Quantum field NE what's called vacuum energy is unstable you can't have what's called vacuum or negative energy and have it just sit there permanently it eventually inexorably must fluctuate and the fluctuations can actually spawn an uh an expansion of that four-dimensional space locally and that occurred at a specific time when you say four-dimensional space can you toss the axis of that space so you can think of as ordinary threedimensional space but imagine uh X Y and Z extend to Infinity in all directions and we're sitting at our local uh what we perceive as the center of our universe it's just our observable universe we can look out 90 billion light years in any direction which is longer than the age of the universe times the speed of light uh that's because the universe has been expanding in addition to having existed for 14 billion years it's been expanding for for that uh an additional power of three times that um and then imagine time so time is a fourth component and we have to weave those together in order to understand how objects behave in this in this landscape of of what we call the cosmos but it wasn't limited to just our what we now see is our universe we have a horizon just like if you go off in to the Pacific Ocean here away from Land uh you see a horizon it's a circular Horizon in all directions so we live on a threedimensional planet right the Horizon is two- dimensional it's it's one dimensional Circle uh that we can see any ship that's above the Horizon we can see visible light coming from it right but we we can perceive that there are things on the other side of the planet that we can't see and we have to learn about those they indirect methods can talk about that different time so there's a horizon on a three-dimensional surface that's a onedimensional surface in four dimensions it's a two-dimensional surface so you kind of lose two dimensions and that means it's a sphere it looks like our universe looks like a sphere centered on us we look in all directions we see constellations we see galaxies we see clusters of galaxies and we go farther than back you see this primordial heat that's left over from the formation of the elements that's called The Cosmic micro background radiation that's what I study its properties and what it reveals it's the oldest light in the universe the oldest possible light it was once visible you could see it if you existed uh but nobody existed back then um and it originates from the formation of the lightest elements and the and the lightest atoms on the periodic table so you could look back and if you could see this you would see a pattern imprinted on that light called called gravitational radiation or waves of gravity and that would be evidence of something beyond the visible Horizon and that would actually originate from this inflationary Epoch if it occurred so I had the idea to build the first telescope a refracting telescope of all things just a telescope with lenses but lenses that are transparent to microwaves and focus microwaves but I realized I could build that telescope and if we were successful I didn't think we wasn't guaranteed to be successful but it was a big enough scientific Quest that it was guaranteed to win a Nobel Prize if we were correct and in fact you know spoiler alert my first book is called losing the Nobel Prize because we had a retracted discovery that we made at Harvard on on uh St Patrick's Day 2014 10 years ago so you had a paper that essentially um LED you to the like realistic possibility that you might win the Nobel Prize and then you and then you had to retract it um do you recall your state of emotional state or state of mind when you realize that you were wrong very clear and that's that's how it relates to this packing and everything um we actually didn't have this paper peer reviewed we were so concerned that a competitor uh which is a spacecraft a billion dollar spacecraft we were just A1 million Doll Experiment a little telescope at the South Pole Antarctica where I've been a couple times and that instrument bested a scientific telescope led by thousand people costing a billion dollars Led Out of You Know multiple countries in America and Europe and we were terrified as many scientists are that we're going to get scooped in fact the the original discovery of the cosmic microwave background was made by accident the discovery of this 3 Kelvin heat Source that's coming to us in all directions IAT a background was made by accident at Bell Laboratories and Bell Labs accidentally discovered it because they were looking at the very first communication satellites you know AT&T Bell Labs a communication so they stumbled on it they accidentally said I'm looking at the satellite that should have a certain amount of uh background hiss noise whatever that was expected but I'm getting hundreds of times that amount and where could that be coming from they did very excruciating very high Precision measurements and they found they couldn't identify a single terrestrial Source or a cosmic Source um of any other sort except for the fact that if the universe began essentially with a big bang they didn't call it that back then that there would be a pervasive heat left over that would be exactly this temperature 3 degrees above absolute zero 3 degrees Kelvin so I knew if they want a Nobel Prize certainly I'd win a Nobel Prize for discovering why that effect happened right it's like you discover you know some amino acids and then you discover well it's produced by DNA well certainly you know if the amino acid won the Nobel Prize certainly DNA would win the Nobel preber dad Arthur cornberg RNA uh son um you know structure of RNA so you publish a paper that wasn't peer-reviewed because you were worried about getting scooped scooped is when someone else beats you to publication um folks and um gets credit for the discovery it's a whole discussion that we could have some other time if we we just want to Riff on the process of science but um so you published the paper yeah we didn't publish it we we submitted it to the archive we had a press conference at Harvard Center for astrophysics and and uh space sciences and uh and it was televised and in the audience were Nobel laurates and and reporters but the discovery that you know was clear that we would have won it however at that time I had been removed from the leadership of the experiment that I created so I created the predecessor experiment you know it's like iPhones you build one then you upgrade it you build a better camera build so the first one I invented when I was a postto at Stanford it was called bicep and it stood for background imager of cosmic extragalactic polarization and it's also kind of a play on words because the pattern of microwave polarization which we can talk about uh was a twisting curling uh pattern so I made the pun like curl like you do bicep the muscle behind curls anyway it's not that funny and and they ended up trying to change the acronym which pissed me off but uh but anyway uh the the the tragic thing is that um we built this experiment we upgraded this experiment it's very hard to get money uh to build it I got money from David Baltimore who's the president of Caltech uh I should say I was at Stanford I should say about David Baltimore just because people might want to go to uh former president of Cal Tech maybe still Rockefeller no former president of the Rockefeller that's an interesting story um if you want to look it up you know look it up as they say scientists are are human um he landed at Caltech so they funded you to do this he gave me a special uh Grant just presidential this called Caltech presidence fund he gave it to me and my postto adviser Andrew Lang was incredible scientist he was married to Francis Arnold who won the Nobel Prize in in 2018 in chemistry renowned scientist uh as well and they were just power couple and he uh invited me to give a talk and I gave a job talk he hired me on the spot I couldn't you know help myself from saying yes before he finished this I was miserable at Stanford by the way it was 1999 2000. boom I was making $32,000 a year living on Alma Street the Cal trains were running every 17 minutes I know because I was awake from 5:00 a.m. you know I couldn't sleep more than four four or 5 hours and I I just said yes moved down to Caltech and because of that I convinced him and my colleague Jamie Bach who's currently a professor to build this telescope and put it at the South Pole in Antarctica and that was the only place we could do it and the only the only University that would fund it was this this gift from David Baltimore's presidential fund so these confidence of events and by the way then because I had this job and because I built this telescope with my colleagues I got the job at UCSD which then enabled me to meet my wife so let me uh incredible story you move down to Caltech which is in Pasadena amazing place and then you get the money how much was this initial one was a million dollars to build a first version okay that's quite a quite a gift for a postto um million bucks you you decide the South Pole will be the place to do it we can talk about why that is and then you make this discovery which turns out to be false yeah so um but it sounds like you have uh good feelings about the experience nonetheless so be because I was recognized and this experiment got a lot of attention because it was the really the first one ever designed to look for the spark that ignited the whole big bang so it became you know just the cause celebra of the cosmology field and are you thinking at this point forgive me for playing therapist here I'm not one I'm not pretending to it's fine um were you thinking at this point okay you know this challenge that I think not all but a lot of sons have with their with their fathers not necessarily best of them but one evaluates um themselves relative to like their family lineage sometimes it's a grandfather this thing of having some um internal friction in order to live up to something yeah sounds like that was driving you when Tiger Woods and another Standford right same same story but father hard pushing driving and then what does he do after he you know is a PGA Champion he wants to like become a Navy SEAL or something like he was hanging out with a lot of seal it wasn't enough for him um so I sorry I interrupted your question so at the point where you made this discovery were you were you feeling like all right check that box um what was kind of revelatory to me is that sometimes you start a quest or you start a journey and the fuel that gets you going it's no longer serves you when you get there you know my brother always says you know baggage has handles so you can put it down nice so that like Journey from initiating it um the experiment um to best my dad to show him up to make him regret that he abandoned me and my brother I mean I always said I could I could see how you banded me I was only seven I'm kind of boring you know he used to joke I only care about kids once they learn calculus he a you what a cruel thing to say he would say it in just and and it is true we did reunite and we did have a reproach M but it was after inventing this experiment after I arrived at Caltech it was I mean he was this kind of intellect and it was so lovely to see you and your dad you know my wish for you is is is to have kind of an experience maybe similar maybe not but when you do have kids and please God you will um you get to you you get a doover you get to kind of correct the mistakes or the ways that you would and you'll never get it right you know one of my friends a psychiatrist he says your job as a parent is to only pass on half of your neuroticism to your kids and if every generation does that you know will'll eventually be a perfect species but um but I but I felt that passion and so forth to kind of best him and then when we reunited and and it no it as I said it no longer served me and but the but the trajectory that I had launched this experiment on continued unabated and so that had this inertia this momentum that couldn't be stopped in fact so many people wanted a part of it and so much pressure was surrounding it that I think you know partially that led to me actually being kind of kicked out of the leadership of the experiment and and that was precipitated by a truly tragic event so I told you my adviser Sarah Church um and you know set up a job interview for me with her adviser when she was a postu at Caltech named Andrew Lang Andrew was like a c at that time I was a stranger my dad he was like a father figure he was like you know like you ever see the the TV show madman like dondre he's just like handsome good-looking everyone thought he was going to win a Nobel Prize he was stolen from Berkeley they spent tons of money to recruit him from you know from Berkeley to come to Caltech he only can't you know his wife was a power couple Francis Arnold again she won the Nobel Prize a few years ago and um he just had the world at his fingertips Charming funny and and he would say things like you know Brian this is so unrealistic that we have to do it like he was a kid he loved to play and he loved he's the one who inspired me in this in this way of just never stopping like that passionate curiosity and the reward that you get I always say you know when you solve a problem your reward is a harder problem like that's but that if you're a scientist that feels good because it's like I always say and I think it's one of your colleagues I'm not I'm not sure so much good stuff going on up there but but uh there's this concept of finite games and infinite games right so I would say science is an infinite game you can't win science it goes on forever no one Masters all of whatever science is you can debate even what it is but it's composed of an infinite number of finite games getting into college getting into graduate school getting a postto getting a tenure track position those are all finite games right um and the ultimate what's the ultimate finite game and Nobel Prize because only three people can win it each year there's only 200 people have ever won it you know there's more people in the NBA than have won it in physics right so this is an very exclusive club and if you know if you win it somebody else isn't going to win it right like odds are and this pressure to kind of get to that level uh should never exceed the passion that drove you to become a scientist in the first place and so I was obsessed with that and what Andrew Lang showed me is that science is its own reward and the pleasure of finding things out as you know fan would say um is its reward science is its own reward and that's characteristic of these infinite games you just want to keep playing them and the tragic thing is that I'm emotional thinking about this when Andrew um was at the peak of his life um he chose to take it he took his own life he killed himself he killed himself ironically tragically he used helium which is uh you know Central to the formation of the universe and the creation of our universe is rying in a large part on helium the abundance of and he affixiated himself in a in a cheap dirty sleazy Motel actually I had stayed at in Pasadena when I was visiting him for my initial job talk can I do you mind if we we um go into this a bit I realize it's a it's a painful memory and I I feel it um you know not to shift the the focus but ironically my all three of my academic advisers Dead first one shot himself in a bathtub uh two weeks after we celebrated uh something for him just like like you know suicide is such a peculiar thing um he did it for very different reasons different stage of life let's get back to to Lang um how old was he he's 41 I think so he's young um had three kids three three son wife still alive yeah Francis still you know renowned Professor was she shocked they were separated they had gotten estranged and um they weren't living together it was interesting he was always very close she had two children I think from previous marriage or one child from a previous marriage um and he was like a father to that son as well like a biological father or whatever that means um kids were so dedicated to him and look don't cry for me I mean I I I still emotional because he meant so much to me as as a mentor as a friend as an adviser as as you know a father figure basically but he had real kids and he had you know adopted kids and it was tragic for everyone suicide is such a peculiar thing because it in some sense it can um quote unquote make sense for if somebody we know is very depressed or they have a terminal illness you know you know and and but sounds like it came as a bit of a surprise do do you think that the um sometimes there's this close relationship between genius and um let's just say not mentally healthy um that you know even what you mentioned before you know like we have to try this experiment I mean there's a bit of recklessness to that when when dealing with millions and millions of dollars and postto careers and you know that there's a I mean the Delight of a fun experiment and an adventurous experiment maybe as a like a a project where you kind of weigh into it a little bit to see but that's very different than like we have to do this there's a risk-taking element there that that supersedes kind of my Notions of like what what an adviser's job is which is to make sure that people progress toward um to Sure Discovery but also like you want some um one of the most important thing to mentoring scientists is that they have some sense that there is a future for them yeah and you can't guarantee it but you'd like to like a parent would for a child you want you want to give them some sense that like the sun's going to come up tomorrow that's right like we're not going to implode or explode here and and he was a he was a pragmatist he would give me advice life advice you know and again I was a strange from my father he was playing this role and he he was just so he was Charming I he handsome charismatic he had just discovered you know came off this discovery of proving that the Universe uh has a a flat spatial geometry which just means that any triangle that you make in the universe whether it's three planets three stars three galaxies three patches of the cosmic microwave background radiation always the interior angles add up to 180 degrees as they do on a flat table here as they did for uclid and that had astonishing implications for How the Universe might have begun and it's still true and this is still true it's more true than ever so do you think that um perhaps I mean who knows um perhaps he committed suicide because he was um at a at a Peak you know one of the things that people talk about is the the peak and trough of dopamine you mention infinite games you know that I I said many times before that um it's very important that you not get fast large amplitude increases in dopamine that are not preceded by effort yeah you methamphetamine will give you a large amplitude um you know fast increase in dopamine but it the there's zero effort involved except to procure it and it sinks you into a post dopaminergic Peak trough at afterwards that um will have you uh hanging on for for the will to live um so what comes up goes down and it often goes down further than it went up when we're talking about dope I mean playing an infinite game is great because it's in the it's in the the motivation to for answers it sounds like he like hit a peak and you you wonder if maybe he was like okay now I'm going to check out now it's going to be hard to keep doing this I don't think it's explicable I don't I don't think you I mean the human brain is the most complicated thing on you know that human brains can even contemplate right it's solipsistic in in a sense but I I couldn't really wait into it I mean I know details of his personal life and yes divorce and separation and and so forth but but um I I don't think I don't think that's it just because the the highs of the new Quest and like the dopamine hadn't really come in from bicep and it wouldn't come in for four more years after his death in 20110 so you got to continue the project we got to continue the project but because he was removed and he was kind of my you know conly you know whatever I was to him I forget what how the relationship goes I'm not as conversing with the mafia as I should be but but with Andrew with his death one of the you know trivial in comparison consequences was that the main Patron and Backer of me in my career who would you know helped me get my job at UCSD had helped me get you know this this presidential career Grant which I received from President Bush and all these incredible accomplishments and just been my sounding board and experiments and kept me going and helped me when I had troubles with my graduates with students and he would talk to my I mean it's unheard of right the this compassion that this man had and if he had only reached out to to me you know I'm sure he had better friends than me but like I would have gone up in a second you know I I went to the motel where he took his life when I was writing my book just to put me back and like try how could I comprehend it I I couldn't I just cried I sat in front of the hotel and I cried but but no I I don't think we can understand it but but the eventual High wouldn't come and then a much more crashing low after we essentially had a retri it and were disconfirmed as they say so you continued with the project yeah I was at UCSD and I left Caltech you get your job you got this telescope down at the the South Pole how do you get to the South Pole you fly to Chile and then you and then you you ride a bicycle you know I never had the the physique to get into the military although I wanted to at one point to be a pilot actually I wanted to go to the Air Force Academy like my stepfather did but um but I didn't have the the phys I didn't have the hlp diet back then uh but the point was um you go on a military it's a whole way and you do it in seven days eight days if you're lucky sometimes it can take three weeks due to the weather down there it's the most violent weather most uh winds turbulence everything you know hostile but it's a cakewalk compared to the Explorer Shackleton um or Scott and um of course aminon so the quest to get to the South Pole first which is South Pole I should say for people that aren't familiar Antarctica is the seventh continent it's the last one to be discovered it was only really discovered it was thought to be there because it was thought that to balance the the continents in the northern hemisphere you needed a massive counterweight in the southern it's so stupid but anyway it wasn't discovered till 1900s that really that they truly existed and then it wasn't explored until 10 or 12 years later and the quest to get to the South Pole it was the last unexplored you know non-filled in part of the map of the Earth so the the quest to get there was like going to the moon and in fact it exactly parallels the moon in that once it was reached for the first time nobody cared to go back again you know for many many years and we're only going back to the Moon Now 60 years later 50 years later after the uh Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 missions right so getting there and setting that bar right and and making that accomplishment sometimes that's the extent of it like when you have the dopamine head of of being the first to get somewhere Scott was a British scientist and an Explorer and amonson was just an Explorer amonson roll amonson he tried to get to the North Pole first he lost somebody else beat him and he said uh well I'm going to keep going with this skis and sled dog team that I have and he literally went to the South Pole 180 degrees around so the the poles are the two end points of the Earth's axis of rotation there's a North Pole uh there's no land there there's no continent there there's ice there and S Santa is there exactly right uh and then the South Pole is a continent if you go I brought a piece of it here that I collected probably illegally from Antarctica I'll show it to you later um it's just rocks right so if you drill under the ice in Antarctica you come to a continent and that's a difference between uh the North and South Poles but the South Pole is uh 700 nautical miles from the coast of Antarctica the closest point of approach in the 1900s was you take a ship from New Zealand you sail toe South there's no other way to go and you come to the continental shelf the coastline is called McMurdo Station which was just you know basically there's some seal lines there and that's it and orcas and Penguins and and nothing else at that time now there's a whole research station and and then they got on skis and skied up 9,000 fet from sea level to 9,000 ft where the polar Plateau flattens out and they got to the South Pole and amonson got there 3 weeks before Scott and Scott was this British you know naturalist and like a Darwin but but also he was a scientist plus an Explorer so he wanted to collect samples and he found flora and fauna there's not much rocks meteorites he actually discovered meteorites in Antarctica incredible scientist and but because he was a scientist it cost him his life because he was carrying all this scientific equipment and scientific samples and he had a ski up them like he would find it and he's like I'm not coming back the same way that he got there because of the wind patterns and stuff so he knew he'd never back so he couldn't leave it there so he had to carry extra food Fuel and Men dedicated to it oh and by the way uh the Norwegian team ammson was Norwegian and they used sled dogs for two reasons one they conserve calories they uh provided propulsion and then they provided a tasty snack once you got to the South Pole because once you get South Pole you can ski downhill 9,000 feet you know to sea level basically and so they ate British would refuse to do that so they they knew they couldn't eat their dogs and they had dogs but they they wouldn't eat them so they were the sled dongs and when they got to the South Pole they came within uh 3 or 4 kmet and it's totally flat like this table the South Pole looks like this go out in the middle of the ocean freeze it paint it white and that's what it looks like it's white 100 you know 360 Degrees around okay it's most boring place on Earth literally and I've been there um he got within so you can see things really far away he got there he got within 3 kilometers and he saw something on the horizon he's like oh you know bleep right and was a Norwegian flag now can you imagine Neil Armstrong steps out of you know the eagle and he lands on a Soviet flag I mean it would be like the most crushing it was the most I think the most depressing moment in human history to come so far and he actually said that he said great God this is a a horrible place and all the more so for having reached it without the benefit of priority so the the king and queen they were depending on him to make the first you know for for man for you know King and country right the seeing the Norwegian flag so what did he do he was a good scientist he said maybe they made a mistake maybe they're off by 10t I can no no they were right the Norwegians got there first and because he got there three weeks later in middle of January by the time he turned around the winds had died down they were no longer at his back he was skiing he had no food he died uh about three weeks later or three months later in March so his body was later recovered and it was a you know wasn't reported back to England for another six months uh so they gave their lives for for science for Discovery and to come up short to be second it must have been the most crushing defeat in history W but it happens to be the best place to do astronomy in the world and you get there by flying to Santiago Chile no first you uh first you go to um Christ Church New Zealand we go to Auckland LAX Auckland Auckland to Christ Church and then uh the US uh has a charter with the New Zealand Air Force and we give them C130 cargo planes or C we have our own c17 cargo planes the jet powered ones unfortunately I got the c130s which is a four prop plane and uh I was on a plane that um that had the entire winter a summer Supply sorry the entire winter supply of bananas on this cargo plane which is as big as room this the cargo hold you know 12 by 12 or you know times 50 feet long and it was filled with bananas and at first you're like oh cool this is great till you realize there's no bathroom on the plane there's just a a literally a 5 gallon bucket and a and a shower curtain there are no windows on it cuz why do you know parat ERS need Windows and you know and uh and then there's enormous crates of bananas there 12 tons of bananas I have not touched a banana in 12 years because of that uh I not missing pottassium or whatever but but the point is you land on the coast and then um if you're lucky you take a flight the next day and it's a ski plane it's the only plane that the US does not export other we export the F35 other car this is a strategic asset that we will not hard to get to it's very difficult so why South Pole y um and does this take us into the realm of light pollution yeah right I mean when I look up at the at the starry night um here in Los Angeles even though I'm T sort of back towards the Eastern Hills yeah um I'm I don't live at the coast um I can see some pretty impressive Stars not as uh impressive as when I highly recommend people get up to the yosd High Country in the in the month of August you can catch some great meteor showers it's an amazing place to begin with um you had the meteor showers and you're you're transported to another place yeah um and there's a lot of light pollution from cities yeah and it travels very very far so I'm guessing you're down the South Pole because there's a less light pollution you're right a slight uh deviation from that is uh it's not light that we're looking for we're not looking for optical light we're looking for heat so it's heat pollution you're exactly right we're looking to avoid heat pollution so we want to be somewhere cold we want to be somewhere that's far away from you know man-made sources of RF interference and microwave interference and Communications obviously um but the South Pole has a couple of other properties one the sun is below the Horizon and the Sun is 5,7 500 Kelvin and we're looking for something that's a fraction of a Kelvin maybe a few Milli or nanokelvin at most so it's billions of times that we want to get avoid even the Earth itself is still 300 almost 300 Kelvin down there you know freezing is is 273 um so it it does have that property but the best part about it it's above a lot of the Earth's atmosphere because at 9,000 feet above sea level and it's so cold you don't know this because you're a California baby but um but on the East Coast when I would grow up uh some days the bane of my existence would be you'd listen on the radio and they'd announce school closures uh due to snowfall in the winter and sometimes they'd say up you're out of luck because it's too cold to snow sometimes the the the air temperature cannot saturate and form precipitation and the South Pole is like that it's so cold that if you took this glass I'm holding a glass here and it was empty at on the table here and I extend this glass up to outer space the amount of water if I took all the water in the atmosphere the humidity in the atmosphere above the South Pole and condensed it into a liquid it would be A3 of a millimeter here in Los Angeles it's about an inch or you know 25 millimeters or more and so you'd like to not go there now why is that important well water absorbs microwaves and that's how your microwave oven works it heats up the water molecules they start to vibrate and jumble that causes friction they heat up and eventually they'll boil right so that's why sometimes you can you know overheat uh you know liquid in a microwave you can't tell but it's super hot and actually can be dangerous but in this case we don't want a photon coming from The Big Bang perhaps or before the Big Bang with the spark that ignited it we don't want that to travel for 14 billion years nearly and then get absorbed in a water molecule above the Earth's surface so the best place to go is space but space even with you know space I haven't done any scientific experiments but it's about a maybe a factor of a thousand to a million times more expensive so the same satellite that we were worried was going to scoop us was exactly a 100 or almost 200 times more expensive than our experiment at the South Pole yeah I was going to ask you about this a million dollars given to a postc that was the first trunch of funding we ended up getting about 10 million 10 million I mean even $10 million is a lot of money by any standard yeah but probably to my mind doesn't seem like enough money to to build a high- powerered telescope at the South Pole bring people there have the infrastructure I mean it's not like you're rolling this thing out onto the ice and and and just pointing at the sky I mean you need I mean I guess you could use the bucket from the plane as a bathroom but you need a number of things so um yeah you probably need hundreds of millions of dollars to build a a facility down at the south pole but those are all funded by by you and your and your listeners and and and so for the taxpayers so the National Science Foundation it operates those c130s are part of the National Science foundation's Fleet we don't pay a dime for them if I want to build a a computer network system down there we don't pay a dime for it it's actually a point of contention because now I'm no longer with that experiment I've I've you know recused myself from it uh for many years not because of the incident where we you know were basically disconfirming later disconfirmed our result right so you let the result out you do this news conference I want I do the news conference okay so big press conference big press conference it turns and you know fast forward some years it turns out this was not correct some months yeah only a few months well better to be corrected quickly than you know collect your Noel prize and have to like give it back or something right I I have to say and and um the pursuit of prizes is a complicated thing I was always discouraged from pursuing prizes all my advisers well my my graduate adviser was very pure in the sense that she just liked doing experiments I remember she was very very smart very smart is Barbara Barbara Chapman I mean when and and you know it's not just her pedigree that that um is evidence of that but since pedigree is something most people can um at least understand internally and externally I mean she was you know went to Harvard as an undergraduate then she was at UCSF and Caltech and she she um actually had a project sending zebra fish up into space looking at uh yeah uh looking at development of the vestibular system in the absence of gravity gravity wow and then um fixing these specimens and bringing them back um also did a lot of great work back on Earth but she wasn't somebody who was ambitious for ambition sake and um and my post adviser was exceedingly ambitious but he he also discouraged prizes and the pursuit of prizes that's the right way to be yeah I think that it's it's it's sort of like going into football to get a Super Bowl ring these things do represent the Pinnacle but um it's dangerous to be chasing that like singular carrot because you can miss the you missed the journey look I'm not proud of that I'm not proud that I had such a base venol you know kind of pursuit uh I think it was as I said compounded by psychological factors you know but did you have fun doing the work oh I loved it yeah I mean getting to do what I do now and now it's even even more exciting in a sense because the project you know and by the way it's not like we made a blunder and like you know Rob helpfully took the lens cap off the camera we didn't make a blunder like that there have been many many blunders and actually led to much worse retractions our results are stronger than ever I should say are the bicep team's results i' I've left the team as I said but their results are still the very best by almost in order of magnitude we hope with the Simons Observatory that I'm uh you know co-leading with with colleagues at Prince and pen and and other places that we can actually supersede them but we haven't yet uh and so what we saw I should be very clear we didn't make a blunder we didn't see like put our Thumb in front of the viewfinder you we didn't make something stupid we mistook a signal produced by another astrophysical source as representative of this curling pattern of microwaves for which bicep was named um that would be indicative if confirmed of the inflationary origin of the universe which by the way would be concomitant with the existence of the Multiverse so the stakes are really high that means the incentives to make sure you detect that are really high too and not get scooped as happened many many times my adviser was scooped he never won the Nobel my advisor's adviser he never won the Nobel Prize these accidentally discovered serendipitously discovered astronomers penzes and Wilson they did win the Nobel Prize um so there is a pressure on scientists to get there first like Falcon Scott Robert Scott getting to the South Pole first there is a benefit to Priority it's just a fact of Life and Science is no different you we teach undergraduates um about seven or eight different experiments all of them won the Nobel Prize at some point in physics history doesn't mean they're a going to win a Nobel Prize no why because they didn't get their first so getting their first and sign that For Better or For Worse is the sign of of greatest accomplishments the sinqua Nan of accomplishment is that that does lead to no prizes now but the goal is always I I have a motto which is you know go as fast as you carefully can yeah um but sounds like you were wrong for the right reasons meaning no one made up data you were there was a confound that you weren't aware of you became aware of it yeah I should say what we saw we what we mistook as the imperator of this origin spark of the universe was the humblest substance in the universe namely dust so when a star explodes it produces after its lifetime as expired it fuses lighter elements into heavier elements eventually it gets to produce iron and iron is the the element for which once it's fused together from I think it's silicon or or two nuclei before it it um it produces too little energy to keep the star buoyant and expanded and so the star immediately starts to collapse when that collapse occurs it blasts out into the interstellar medium that surrounds it all the the byproducts the Silicon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen and the iron and it blasted out into the universe uh surounding it and that happens enough times in our galaxy that the Galaxy is actually pretty polluted place uh it's smoggy it's dusty it's dirty and the dust is actually little microscopic meteorites so on my website brian.com uh I give away actually I have a special link bring.com huberman uh I will uh give away actual meteorites that come from your ancestral homeland of Argentina and you'll see when you get them they're highly magnetic they're very dense and I give you the material uh the composition of these meteorites in the assay we do x-ray crystallography on them it's really cool the um the actual composition of them uh was uh is determined by this last event that a star does before it dies which is to produce iron so we did discover a microwave signal from the Galaxy not from the Big Bang not from the cosmos but from particular and unique to our galaxy which is that when a star explodes it produces this material mostly made of iron these the microm meteorites that I talked about put on my website for your listeners and this um these micrometeorites are also going to act like little Compass needles they're highly magnetically susceptible so the Milky Way everything in the universe has a magnetic field you have a magnetic field birds have it um you know even magnet bacteria can have it and our planet obviously has it and the galaxy has it what happens when you put a compass in a magnetic field those needles get aligned with the magnetic field that then produces a type of polarization now polarization is the least familiar light has three characteristics its intensity its color or spectrum and its polarization almost nobody knows what polarization is but it's really the essence of what makes light a wave if you think about an ocean wave the ocean wave is going up and down undulating up and down and the undulation the direction perpendicular to the Sea surface is it sort of its polarization happens to be the water waves are actually polarized longitudinally but forget that or if you and I separated by a meter and a half 2 met we have rope between us if we oscillate that rope up and down at a certain frequency the frequency will be the Spectrum the color of the light the how hard we do that would be the intensity of the light and the plane that we're oscillating the jump rope or whatever that's the plane of polarization these little needles of cosmic dust from the exploded um inter inerts of a star that died to you know in our galaxy many years ago and many many billions of these Stars uh they produce these these particles of dust so we saw that pattern instead of seeing being the birth pangs of the Big Bang the origin of the universe I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've been wearing Roa readers and sunglasses for years now and I love them they're lightweight they have superb Optics and they have lots of frames to choose from I'm excited to share that Roa and I have teamed up to create a new style of red lens glasses these red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening after the sun goes down they filter out short wavelength light that comes from screens and from LED lights the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used as overhead and frankly lamp lighting nowadays I want to emphasize Roa red lenss glasses are not traditional blue blockers they're not designed to be worn during the day and to filter out blue light from screen light they're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths that suppress melatonin secretion at night and that can alter your sleep so by wearing Roa red lens glasses they help you calm down and they improve your transition to sleep most nights I stay up until about 10: p.m. or even midnight and I wake up between 5: and 7:00 a.m. depending on when I went to sleep now I put my Roa red lens glasses on as soon as it gets dark outside and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep which makes sense based on everything we know about how filtering out shortwave lengths of light can allow your brain to function correctly Roa red lens glasses also look cool frankly you can wear them out to dinner or to concerts or out with friends so it turns out it is indeed possible to support your biology to be scientific about it and to remain social after all if you'd like to try Roa go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout so I want to talk about what you're working on now before I do that yeah right mini segue there are a number of questions that I have that some of which I sort of know the answers to most of which I don't know the answers to but I think a lot of people either wonder about or if they don't they can quickly enrich their experience of daily life if we were to get answers on the following so I'm thinking about this not rapid fire Q&A but maybe like one to three minute answers about the following for instance why does the Moon look so much bigger when it's near the Horizon as opposed to uh overhead yeah my son asked me that two days ago so that's a fun one so uh let's go first with that sometimes the Moon is huge sometimes the Moon is small um and I'm not talking about when it's full versus a sliver right um tell us why so the Moon is always a half a degree wide same exact apparent angular diameter as the sun which is unique among the 290 moons in our solar system only our moon has the same apparent diameter as seen from its Planet as the sun does meaning we're the only planet that can have a total solar eclipse an exact total solar eclipse like we had a couple a months ago in Austin Texas and elsewhere um be that as it may the moon doesn't change in size um I would hope not that that would freak me out yeah uh the Moon is uh is about 60 times the Earth's radius from the earth it's 250,000 miles away which is about one and a half light seconds away uh and it is about the size of the continental US in in uh diameter so uh or a little bit less so the uh the moon's size doesn't change but when the human eye has something to compare it to the the the brain has a reference point to compare it to and because it's so big if there's something in front of it a 747 a um a a person uh a large building even when you were if the moon is behind that object because it's so far away moving even the Earth's entire radius doesn't change the moon's apparent angular diameter it's the same in P King as it is here Beijing as it is in Los Angeles right so that means a very small a very large change in the distance in the Earth would change the building size dramatically it could reduce it to zero basically but when you compare it to something that lands close on the horizon your brain has something visually to compare it to when it's overhead Zenith or whatever it doesn't have anything to compare it to so you're just looking at it but you can always measure it and you can prove to yourself it's always the same size it's about the size of your pinky fingernail held at arms length same size as the sun and interestingly enough it's you said one degree it's half a degree half a degree degree oh that's why you said pinky so folks um most people probably aren't familiar with thinking in degrees if you want to understand a degree put your uh right or left doesn't matter um arm out in front of you raise your thumb like a thumbs up so at the the width of your thumb at at arms length is approximately one degree that's why you say for your pinky it's about half a degree I should also say and this is an opportunity to give a a fun little lesson in visual Acuity if I were to draw um 30 black lines spaced from one another with the just the the uh light color of your nail in between them uh we'd say they were 60 lines you know black nail black you know alternating um your Acuity for 2020 vision is approximately 60 cycles per degree yes a hawk any kind of raptor is about 120 cycles per degree which is why they can sit up on a lamp post and actually see the the rustling of the of the grass below and probably make out some of the individual Furs on the on the head of a rodent but you can't so you um so what do I mean by 60 cycles per degree if if if I were to draw um 40 black lines so now you have 80 total of black and then the color of the nail black then the color of the so you would see that as believe it or not as solid black right it's it's uh you don't have it's beyond your Acuity threshold when you say one degree so this is important so so when the moon is is quote unquote giant at the Horizon put out your pinky it covers the moon you can eclipse the moon right you can eclipse the moon when the moon is overhead you can eclipse the moon with your pinky and most people thinking no way that can't be true but it's absolutely true fun fact uh which is bigger the uh width of a rainbow or the width of the Moon and is a rainbow wider than a half a degree you ever seen a rainbow you can visual I mean in the sky it seems as I'm not talking about the arc the band thick from red to blue from Red ro ro Biv yeah what's bigger gosh intuitively I want to say it's thicker but now you're going to tell me that it can't be because it's um this is like the the pink Floyd album right this is literally just the the the polar Side of Moon the dark side of the moon the rainbow coming through when you take light and pass it through pris um I'm gonna say it's one it's one degree uh so the rainbow's bigger uh no the the moon's bigger it seems like roughly the same size but I when I think of a r i just think of like the it's the same size it's the size of the sun which question thank you very much there you go Professor FES the the test for once yeah um okay next question people obsess over this I have my theories I think it's still debated when you watch a sunset you get that beautiful long wavelength short wavelength contrast that I blab about incessantly on the podcast and social media because that's what setting your circadian clock it's that orange red tones and the blue tones of the sky but right as the sun goes down across the Horizon especially over the ocean there is the phenomenon known as the Green Flash yes what is the basis for the Green Flash well I'll tell you something really cool if you go to the South Pole which is over subscribed by a factor of 10 to one you believe 10 times as many people want to spend their nine Monon year of their nine months of their year minimum at the South Pole than we have room for to actually do work at the South Paul's car which means 10 people total no there's 45 people there just kidding just kidding and they're all listening to you half the time um so um when you want to go there when you do go there they actually don't know where the Sun is going to set remember the Sun only Rises and sets once a year right so it's one day and one night per year six months long um where the sun sets is unknown and and actually the days preceding it the sun is making a big circle around your head I've seen this with the moon so the Sun and the Moon they just make a circle and slowly after reaching their Apex on the first day of summer which is December 21st for them down there upside in eventually it crosses the Horizon on March on March 21st around March 21st that's the first day of fall or when they start getting ready for winter they don't know where it's going to go down we think of it always going to the west but where is West at the South Pole every direction you look is North okay uh so when this uh occurs the actual phenomenon that you mentioned the Green Flash can last for days or can last for hours so if you really are an afficionado of huberman protocols and you want to see the Green Flash apply to be down there but the bad news is you're stuck there for nine more months okay um so yes it's a real phenomenon not only can you take pictures of it but you you can see it uh with your eye uh the cor only correction I would say is you pretty much need to have a perfectly clear day you can't have any clouds on the horizon um and it's best seen over the ocean so we're blessed here but for those of us that don't end up at the South Pole yeah God willing um send me pictures like I don't like environment Z really kill it um but uh but if I watch the sun set over the Pacific or or um I see the Green Flash sometimes uh what's the basis of that yeah so the Earth's atmosphere is actually a um it's it's layered okay but it's actually simpler to think about the Earth as being flat now there's no hopefully there's no flers out there thinking that Brian keing is a is advocating the Flat Earth but imagine this table we're looking at a table imagine there's a slab of you know translucent glass on it and we're sitting at the on the table underneath the slab of glass pretty thick glass right and you're looking straight up you look through a minimum amount of the glass right straight up would be Zenith at your local Horizon every direction you're looking is your Horizon you see off the edge of this Flat Earth in this uh in this analogy um when you look at a slight angle you're going through more path length of the substr of the substance more glass finally if you did have this thing extending to Infinity you'd be looking through an infinite amount of atmosphere or glass when you're tangent to the Horizon when you're going parallel to the Earth's surface and this Flat Earth analogy uh the earth atmosphere is not only made of oxygen it actually has a lot of particulat and be it's because of those particulates a lot of them come from dust and and uh a lot of them come from you know volcanoes and and and a large amount now comes from human-made uh sources pollution and so forth the more Optical depth the more path length that you look through the more scattering of the Sun's light occurs when scattering occurs the longer wavelength light is e more easily penetrates through dust smog particles even glass okay so that goes through easier and the short wavelengths comparable to the intermolecular spacing of the smog the dust the gas in the atmosphere the oxygen scatters much more efficiently and so that gets scattered out of the beam of light from the sun the Sun's light though actually Peaks slightly in the green we don't actually notice this because our eyes are and we're used to thinking of it as very yellow um it happen and this the reason for this can be you know substantiated by U night vision glasses what color is the light coming in it's green right they amplify versions of these things why because your eye is very sensitive to Green Light it's even more sensitive to Green Light than yellow light so and that's because the sun which is what we've evolved to adapt to being most sensitive to sunlight is more greenish than yellow so there's more power at the wavelength like somewhere between like 450 and 550 nanometers exactly 100% right um so at that green flash at that moment of Green Flash you're seeing two things one is the sensitivity of the human eyes slightly ma maximized to that but that doesn't explain why photographs see it as well and the other reason is that most of the yellow light and the sunlight is getting scattered away and so you're mainly seeing that green light but you're only seeing it at the point of Maximum scattering which occurs exactly when the sun crosses the Horizon because of the interaction with all that atmospheric dust y that's wild because for the longest time I had a biological explanation for this that I think was based on a paper that was published maybe in nature but don't quote me on that um just because published in nature doesn't mean it's wrong there's I've Got Friends with a few nature editors still um and a great Journal look amazing we talk we do a whole episode about nature nature science and cell but the um the explanation that was getting kicked around for a while was a biological explanation which is that our ability to perceive Reds and greens and blues and yellows is based on our trichromacy the presence of these three different photo receptors short medium and long wavelength or you know green red so to speak that absorb short medium or long wavelength light and then the comparison there's this opponency um whereby our ability to see red is really contention on our ability to perceive green and so what like for a for someone who's red green color blind one in 80 males for instance they still see stuff out in the world that's red but they see as more orangish or brown ah okay dogs the same way right they're not colorblind true monochromats that don't see are very rare that is a one form AC I think it's called AC chromates yeah um don't quote me on that either but in any case the the idea was that if you're looking at something that's very enriched in Long wavelengths like orange red and you stare at it for long enough have you ever done that like American flag uh visual optical illusion when you stare at it then you look away from it and you see the opposite colors right and so one biological explanation is that the the Sun is setting and you're looking at this orange red thing when the sun is low in the sky you can actually look at it without um distressing your eyes right because right um as opposed to overhead when you should never stare at the Sun and then the moment that that reddish orange disappears The the biological explanation is that there's a a kind of perception of a green flash yeah because of the opponent seeing the switch to the other let's just say wavelength channel so to speak I don't think that's in disagreement I think that might explain the amplification that we see but then it doesn't explain why you'd see it in a photographic emulsion right there's nothing biological about it I like your explanation better because it's explained by uh by real physics and and the biology of color opponency is also physics but um but not as well worked out yeah okay cool earlier we were talking about the perceived relationship between the menstrual cycle which is not always 28 days but is on average 28 days and the lunar cycle is there any evidence that um well it'd be amazing if one influence the other in the in the other direction that the menstrual cycles were influencing the lunar cycle but is there any evidence uh between for a true relationship between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle that's been documented I don't know uh it's interesting The Sun Also produces tides and produces gravitational effect um but the dominant effect on Earth due to that 28 day 29 day cycle of the moon is its effect on the Earth's oceans which produces four Tides a day too high and too low and actually Galileo incorrectly used that phenomenon as a way to butress his argument that the Earth went around the sun he basically if you're listening I'm taking my glass of MAA yante yeah so he said that when the earth is spinning it rotates once per day but it's also revolving around the Sun so these combined motions make this sloshing of the liquid you see that and he claimed that is what caused the tides on the earth and the fact that's completely wrong it's amazing Andrew and you think about how brilliant a scientists can be and it's almost like the proportion of their blunder is proportionate to how brilliant they are you know because it it also correlates with the the the um height of the problems they're chasing exactly um you were you were saying that Galileo got certain things wrong but got a number of things right that's right Einstein too Newton too being wrong for the right reasons is actually very important in science for and by the right reasons I mean that nobody's you know pcking P value hacking or fudging data that they're not tossing data they're really trying to solve problems and you it's almost like in sports a great competitor wants great competitors yeah I mean what's the like why would somebody want to like cheat into a different weight class knock somebody out and consider themselves the world champion at that weight class like it's just it's silly it's it's and in science to not try and seek the truth is anti-science U certainly it happens but okay so no no clear evidence that the lunar cycle influences the the men I would expect that it would influence other animals I don't know what the menstral Cycles are you know deer or whatever you know who knows or or any animal that has you know an egg that you know well a lot of animals have not a menstrual cycle but an EST cycle so like a a lot of rodents have like a 4-day cycle okay um so it clearly doesn't map to the the lunar cycle but um you hear a lot about about these things and humans are amazing at drawing correlations it's a again we're a prediction making machine we're a storytelling machine and you know and in the past by the way the moon was a lot closer than it not a lot but it was closer the moon moves about the width of your again back to your fingers now so the moon moves Away by the the width of about your thumb's fingernail every year moves further away centimeter away from the earth because there's a gravitational competition between the gravitational force of the moon and the Earth's oceans provide a source of friction so over the years it's getting farther and farther away such that it won't eventually won't be able to have total solar eclipses it'll be it's called an annular Eclipse where it doesn't obscure it completely anyway so in the past this is the only way to say millions of years ago when the first hominids were evolved you know the moon was much much closer you know millions of times of their you know fingernails eventually it starts to add up um and certainly when the first life formed on the earth it was only you know uh was probably 30 times closer than it is now so yeah so I short answer I don't know where are some of the best places in the Northern Hemisphere and please don't say uh the North Pole um where people can go see spectacular um nighttime stuff yeah um so I think of yosity High Country in August for the meteor shower yeah certainly not at the level that you're accustomed to looking at things but with the naked eye you're going to be assuming that that it's not cloudy you're going to be treated to um a light show that is in my experience beyond anything I've ever exper just spe just extraordinary on my the special website that I made Brian king.com hubman I list the four major meteor showers in one in each season that people can watch with your naked eye in fact it's had to use a telescope you don't want a telescope because it juts through the field of view yeah exactly you want the whole field of view and humans have an amazing as you know huge field 190 degrees or something like that you know just so not as big as an owl but but quite big and you want to take that in because you're you're looking for motion you're looking for intensity sometimes you can see colors and I list what elements contribute to the colors of different meteorites on this you know website that I had um but yes the uh the anywhere that's uh more than say 20 30 40 miles away from a big major city is fine even in San Diego uh there's two dark sky communities one is called Julian California and the other one's the anab bgo desert and it's called bgo Springs these are areas where they uh forbid upward Shining Light so the only light can be downward facing it also has to have very narrow spectral bands on it so like sodium vapor you know very high so that you can filter it out basically with certain very inexpensive Optical filters but you know like I said almost anywhere but the good thing to know is that if you get a telescope again you can see 90% of what's going to be fascinating to you as as a lay person with a telescope that cost $50 you can see all the craters you can see mountains on the moon and again these mountains were not just like cool things they destroyed a they falsified the scientific Paradigm quote unquote which was that the moon was perfectly crystalline and and spherical Galileo showed no not only does it have mountains I can measure the height of those mountains I can measure the plains of L lava flows and and eventually they they came out theories that it doesn't have tectonic motion it doesn't have an iron core I mean it's amazing you can see all these things with your uh with the small telescope like the one I have for you um but uh you don't need like the Hubble telescope or Mount will you don't need any of that you can see the rings of Saturn the moons of Jupiter you can even on a dark sky without a telescope see an object that's outside of our galaxy it's called the Andromeda galaxy that's very important in the history of astronomy in 19 19 29 1923 rather uh on Mount Wilson not far from here Edwin Hubble realized that that was not part of the Milky Way galaxy it was way too far away to be located within the Milky Way it was about 20 times the radius of the Milky Way and that revolutionized all of our our you know con conceptions of where the universe is located is it centered on us are we the most important thing no he showed that you can see that on most fall nights in the constellation Andromeda with your naked eye it's six times wider than the full moon it's incredible when I look at many of the constellations I don't see how our ancient predecessors um got to the description of a a bear or whatever is that because they saw more stars than I did or is that because they had a Wilder imagination or we're taking psychedelics or something 20 centuries before Tik Tok um so I cut them some slack there are a couple that look similar to what they're you know or it depends on how you connect the dots the big The Big Dipper and the Little Dipper kind of like a okay you you get that those aren't constellations those aren't con I have to be I have to put on my my very very prec why are they not constellation uh so they're uh they're portions of a constellation so they're they're called asterisms so an asterism is a collection of stars that's associated with each other but it's not uh the the full composition of a constellation so the constellation is actually called Ursa Major the big Dippers in the tail and the hind quarters of Ursa Major which is the Great Bear the Little Dipper is the AST ISM Seven Stars that make up there's 80 something stars that make up the little bear which actually doesn't look like a bear Ursa Major kind of does look like the California republic flag that we have um but uh but yes the the asterism I always ask for people to leave you can't you know they're not making new constellations there's only 88 constellations over the whole uh four Pi spherical uh uh Dome of the sky but you can leave your own asterism on the podcast you can leave five stars on your podcast and mine so you can't have a constellation but you can have an Asis love it uh did you catch uh Haley's Comet when it came by when you were a few years older than I was I was uh I was uh 14 it was right after I got my first telescope comes through every SE every 70 some years make it to the next 76 years yeah that's right I'm right that was a that's very good yeah I remember 70 something all right but like the best constellation it's like the best comet in history in fact there's better ones yeah I remember going out to see it it was a part of a group that went camping and it looked like a smear of light it's hard to know did I really see it or did I not in any case um your daddy prob the only other comment that I that came to mind um oh is the San Diego thing was the hail Bop haop where there was a group that committed mass suicide yeah these were people that had castray themselves had been eating a subc caloric M sub maintenance caloric diet to live forever and then decide to wear Converse and kill themselves what do you think let's not go dark there um what what do you think is the relationship between like comets and these these wild human behaviors it's so interesting you mention that and lunacy for that matter like full moon and lunacy lunacy right crime statistics so look at these words disaster catastrophe they asked in both of those means star they used to believe that stars comets eclipses those things were influencing events on Earth caused by these Celestial forces for not propitiating them making them Gods happy or whatever and in fact Columbus owes his life you know he was almost killed in Jamaica and I think it was 15 uh 1498 a couple years after discovering he's still exploring and um he was failed to ingratiate himself with the local you know native inhabitants of Jamaica wherever he was um and uh they were going to kill him and he luckily had on for navigation astronomy and navigation have always been intimately related because um first of all if you know where Polaris is which is not the brightest star it's in the Little Dipper it's the pole star it's the North Star you've heard of True North Northstar it's actually very close to being if you go to the North Pole and look straight up it's very close to being directly above you and does it always Mark true north and and any human time scale it does over over thousands and tens of thousands of years it it changes but right now for the next couple thousand years so you know don't don't worry you still be accurate that is within a half a degree or that your brain thinks at these time scales as long as you're talking for the next thousand years you're good well I say like this you know the universe could end in a heat death and a big rip or whatever but you know that's not for a trillion years so everybody keep paying your taxes uh so you could use it for navigation so you could know your latitude but measuring longitude was very difficult because you couldn't actually you to know longitude you need to measure time relative to where grenwich meantime is that's how Greenwich became uh so important and that's why London had its huge economy again these things are always related capitalism and and even how we measure latitude and longitude comes from the fact that London and temps River 90% of the world's Commerce flowed through there at one point point or another it's incredible so anyway latitude longitude is very important people started to know that um yeah these these events would occur and including this event with with Columbus and his and he brought along with him on his voyage an astronomer um and this astronomer knew that in uh two days time from when these uh uh natives had captured some of Columbus's crew that there was going to be a total solar eclipse and it was going to go through Jamaica and he said he told Columbus and Columbus said to the inhabit if you don't give our people back our our God is going to obscure and kill your God the Sun God they're like f you you know whatever and then it happened and they totally believ that they were in control of these celestial events we better give the people back and Columbus got the hell out of there so it's an amazing story but yes comets have always been a a so Columbus actually um used the Sun as manipulative barter to to threat to as a threat military yeah he used it for military uh coercion an important book for anyone to read who's interested in basically why we're still here um in my opinion is the book longitude yes I'm interview Dava Soo I'm interviewing her tomorrow this is an incredible book um doesn't require any science or technical background to read and appreciate about the development of the first reliable timekeeping devices for navigating at Sea uh even on um overcast nights and uh longitud and finding longitude it's a spectacular read it is and um change the way that I think about human evolution and and Technology development generally direct connection I sorry to interrupt but there's a connection between that and the Nobel Prize so there was something called the longitude prize in the 1700s to develop a clock that could be used in the naval and Naval situations on boats you couldn't use a grandfather clock as the the pendulum acceleration so they had to find something and this guy Thompson or somebody Haron Harrison yes so he invented this this mechanical clock with predecessor of our modern WI up clocks obviously we used uh cesium and atomic clocks but that prize for 10,000 you know pounds or whatever it was was an early predecessor of the Nobel Prize I've been waiting this whole conversation to talk to you about Adaptive Optics let me give just a little bit of backdrop for how I'm approaching this um in the field of Neuroscience there there's as with any field of biology a desire to see smaller and smaller things at higher and higher resolution and there have been all sorts of incredible discoveries in microscopy like two Photon microscopy one Photon microscopy electron microscopy you see things down to the you know tiny tiny nanometer size some years ago uh a group out of University of Rochester developed um Adaptive Optics I think it was David Williams's Group which is borrowed from astronomy and my very top Contour understanding of this is that you're using the presence of noise in the environment essentially as part of the microscope to get a better image and this was used in the field of Opthalmology to look into the back of the eye this incredible three cell layer thick pie crust that lines the back of our eyes that it gives us all of our visual perception not alone but allows for all of our visual perception as I mentioned before that the eye has a lens there's Vitus there's all sorts of opportunity for light scatter and then within the the eye itself you've got these multiple layers you have to go through before you can see the photo receptors but using Adaptive Optics you can take all that noise all that stuff between the microscope and what you want to see Way Way Back in the eye and use that in air quotes here noise and make it part of the microscope so to speak and without going into further detail there I was always told that Adaptive Optics was borrowed from your field astronomy where people used the the presence of atmospheric dust of these stuff in the way and made it part of the lens if you will to be able to see things at higher resolution which I just think is so incredible it's like saying the the the barrier becomes the portal um through which you can see even more than had you had a clear obacle is the way let's sh out all right shout out Ryan holid never yeah never met him but I like that book very much okay so what what is Adaptive Optics yeah um at the level for astronomers okay so we live in an atmosphere a planet with an atmosphere thank God we wouldn't be here having this conversation right um and that atmosphere is a dirty window it's like literally looking through uh the windshield of your car and it's cloudy and Dusty and and contaminated we live in uh in in its presence and the best astronomical telescopes are the ones that are launched above the atmosphere out of the atmosphere Hubble Space Telescope Kepler and now the James web telescope again those are multi-billion dollar telescopes the James web to build it and by the way any one lesson to leave you with and maybe your audience with as well is whenever you hear a scientific instruments cost always in your mind at least double it Andrew Lang my late great mentor used to say multiply by pi uh because a you're not taking into account the fact that you don't build say a destroyer or an aircraft carrier to build it you build it to use it and it's about 10% of the operating of the uh construction cost to operate an instrument a battleship a telescope whatever it's a rule of thumb that project managers love to use so that means in 10 years it's going to double the price and we hope that Hubble and and web and Hubble's already lasted for years on it um so it'll last a long time so whenever you hear this but it's incredibly expensive one kilogram used to cost like $10,000 to bring to orbit and Elon keeps talking about how cheap it's going to be 5 but he has yet to launch a scientific instrument I talked to him for 10 minutes on my podcast once and I tried to get him to uh shut off these starlinks are amazing I have one in my house uh but they have the property that they go through astronomical images and they leave a satellite trail behind them which is you know can be com you're taking a picture of a deep star a deep you know Galaxy or whatever and you see these streaks going through it it ruins the image and you have to wait until they're gone but at least an optical astronomy you can physically literally paint those satellites black and they will no longer reflect and so they won't obscure the image whatsoever so you're saying that the Starling satellites are going to make your job more difficult they definitely uh are because you can while you can paint an optical satellite black and make it black we're looking for heat there's no way to stealth you know confuse or or BL out heat sorry that's a law of thermodynamics anything that's above absolute zero will always give off heat and worst of all the signals that he uses are in the exact microwave spectral range that we use to look at the CMB the cosmic microwave background so what's his response to this I told him that having internet everywhere is more important no he said he would look into it you know nine months ago Elon I know you like the show uh so please do reach out to me but this would be just turning it off when it's over our telescope basically that's what and the South Pole so it's not a big specific request there's no one at the it's not like he's getting millions of dollars in ad revenue from people at the South Pole they don't use them so anyway that's I'm I'm asking Elon it's it's a small ask but anyway um so we want to be above the atmosphere but it's Millions maybe billions of dollars to do that for a telescope like we're using or for an optical telescope here on Earth so scientists became very uh convinced that there has to be a way to mitigate the effects of the atmosphere now what is the main effect of the atmosphere well you learned it when you were a kid twinkle twink twinkle little star how I wonder what you are what is that twinkling it's called scintillation scintillation is a property of a point source which is a star so far away even though they're enormous they still only subtend a Zero Dimensional almost Zero Dimensional dot of light on the sky when it goes through the atmosphere the atmosphere has macroscopic turbulence features the atmosphere is a fluid there's turbulence there's roing columns or cells of the atmosphere and if you've ever looked at a star they Jitter they they they looks like they're moving around and that's the combination of the atmospheric cells each column of air that has slightly more density will refract light slightly different angles remember we talked about light when it goes through an a lens it refracts it bends so should we be thinking about the light from Stars kind of like a jagged line coming towards our eye it's coming through it's getting deflected slightly and it's moving in and it's landing on different retinal cells and we're perceiving that as is motion or in a CCD array it's also landing on different pixels so you can't get away from it you know by using uh technology it's still an effect it's caused by these atmospheric turbulent cells and by the way you can tell and you can identify a planet by the fact it does not scintillate it does not twinkle twinkle so Jupiter's visible tonight I hope you'll see it with the telescope we can see it after we're done recording uh we keep going we're about halfway done I figure uh we'll go outside we'll look at it and you'll see it's not it's stationary and I actually used that on the N of kiss my way for the first time but I'm not going to talk about that uh when you look at the planet you can identify them by their lack of C vation it's it's a way to identify if it's a a plane a star or a planet so astronomers including a colleague of mine and UC system CLA Max and other people realized in the 1960s and 70s that if they had um a a a fake star it's actually called either a guide star or an artificial star I'll explain what how they make that in a minute then if they knew the exact properties of that guide star then they could measure just the guide star through the same Optics of the telescope and then they would broad they would take the the light from that artificial star onto a flexible deformable mirror so the mirror could actually wobble and wiggle and it would do so an exactly compensatory way to nullify the atmospheric turbulence so it's basically what light does when it goes through um a cell of the atmosphere it traverses a slightly longer path difference so they would shorten the path difference of the mirror they make it a little bit closer in the direction of that cell and other places they make it farther away and vice versa they compensate for it and this was done by a combination of two technologies one was uh the deformable mirror that could Flex 100 times per second and the other was U making these artificial Stars so how do they make an artificial star they shoot a laser into the troposphere that laser illuminates sod the troposphere troposphere is a layer of the atmosphere uh I used to know all the different layers but okay okay osphere is the farthest away so some layer of the atmosphere it's 40 30 40 km above the Earth it's not quite in space farther enough away way that the laser beam is still columnated makes a nice beam and it can illuminate and then cause this sodium ions to uh flues basically so they start to get really stimulated it looks just like a star they know exactly how they produced it they know exactly what what phase and wavelength to correct in the mirror and then they say it's almost as good as going into space it corrects exactly the compensation of the Earth's atmosphere with the combination of this deformable mirror and it was actually used by my colleague Andrea gz here at UCLA uh to measure the properties of stars orbiting around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way and test Einstein's theory of relativity without this on the twin 10 meter diameter kek telescopes in Hawaii she never would have won that Nobel Prize so it's amazing technology but it was classified it was so uh useful to uh to astronomers uh but it wasn't as useful as to the military remember I said Galileo used his telescope to sell it to the military Venice uh it was immediately classified by the US military uh because if you think about a spy satellite what's it doing well it's staring down to earth and it's looking at license you know looking at whatever on Earth it's also going through the atmosphere it's going to have the same problems so they wanted to use that and have this technological advantage over the Soviets probably in the 1970s and 80s so they classified it they didn't let many uh astronomers could build things they could deliver the finished product but they couldn't patent it they couldn't use it and so Claire Max as I said she could have been you know super rich but it's interesting because now they're using it um so it's bad enough to look you know know from Earth to space but as I said if you imagine the Earth as having a slab of an atmosphere imagine a sniper the sniper trying to make a Kill Shot You Know Jack goes out there trying to hit something five kilometers three kilometers away or whatever there's a lot of atmosphere in the way and if you're looking through a optical site that will also happen so now they're they're actually using this Optical um compensation and sniper Scopes are using this technology Adaptive Optics so it's another way that astronomy has you know influenced military uh you know developments as well very interesting I don't want to go uh too far down this rabbit hole but I'm aware that there are some technologies now to use lasers to extract sound waves in a similar way so there are technologies that exist where you can shine a laser at say a window on a building from very far away and actually hear the conversation inside the room by way of the sound waves hitting that window the conversion of sound waves to Optical and then from Optical back to sound on your computer allows that also there was a technology that was um publicized a few years back developed in at least in part at Stanford the ability to see around corners um by shining lasers at the most visible location closest to what you want to see and then capturing Reflections and sound waves at that location and essentially being able to reconstruct images around corners see how many objects are there so pretty wild stuff you can you can imagine the military and spy implications but also just but but perhaps just as interesting um the ability to for instance map the uh positions and movements of Critters in the deep ocean without actually having to quote unquote see them you could you could hear hear them I had a really interesting experience a few Summers back of going to somebody's pool it was an impressive pool but the most impressive thing about it was that you could hear music perfectly well underwater using adaptive uh adaptive Acoustics and listening to your episode go no it's wild you could dive you listen to something above water dive below water and still hear it as if it playing in headphones maybe not quite as well as in headphones but and if you sosed around in the water there' be a little perturbation but it's pretty spectacular wasn't my pool unfortunately I have one um big question that I think everybody would like the answer to which is to what extent do you think there's life outside Earth um or not on Earth and when people hear this they think aliens but you know like an insect likee creature uh sing or small multicell organism on another planet that that itself would be a spectacular find yeah I mean Beyond spectacular um is there any evidence that that does exist is there any reason to think that it couldn't exist um and if it does would it have to be in a different in a different galaxy altogether what's the what what's the going uh belief among those who are like real scientists who don't believe that there's whatever just real scientists like what's what's the Thought like a centipede on Mars like I I don't think too many people would um be totally surprised um they but that'd be pretty wild well yeah I'm kind of an outlier so just everyone should you know look to the actual experts in this field but I have some rigorous you know kind of logical arguments that I believe the probability of Li I would never say it's zero but I think it's very low and I I think I can substantiate that and the best part is I can't be falsified right now there's zero evidence that there's life anywhere else in the universe period full stop and a sentence there's no evidence conclusive evidence in lots of drones over New Jersey right now not no evidence of Life knew get into drones um uh so the the argument that it would somehow first of all transform our understanding of human place is inarguable to me I I believe that's true although in um this movie contact is a really wonderful movie uh it's not cheesy science fiction it was the first to like use a wormhole and all sorts of cool stuff as contrivances but in that movie there's a scene where President Bill Clinton is talking about the discovery that this fictitious character made but he's actually talking about a meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica and they just clipped that and the meteorite was believed to have microbial life and that meteorite's origin was in inarguably from Mars okay so the reasoning was this 1997 that there was a meteorite found on in Antarctica where it's easy to find meteorites is in the movie in real life there in real life in 1997 a scientist announced a discovery of a meteorite from Antarctica it's called Allen Land Hills meteorite and it had what they claimed were evidence of microbial life and even respiration byproducts of these microbial life forms okay it was such a big deal that within minutes you know Bill Clinton had a press conference on the White House lawn where he goes this Rock speaks to us from across the generations and if confirmed will undoubtedly you know revolutionize our understanding of the universe around it okay now the movie clips that clip to make it seem like Ellie the fictitious character discovered a like you know set extraterrestrial technology not a microb but in the Public's in mind that actual scientific discovery was never falsified it was certainly never confirmed no one's ever come back to say that was correct and that we did find microbial evidence of microbial Life on Mars now how did that meteorite get there well uh some asteroids hit the moon that's why it has craters on it it hits the Earth that's why we have meteor crater Arizona winds Arizona uh yukatan chalub where the dinosaurs Doom was was sealed by the giant impactor 66 million years ago those impacts occur on every planet every moon in our solar system so some asteroid hit the surface of Mars probably millions of years ago ejected material low gravity on Mars low atmosphere uh and that material has been orbiting around and eventually made its way and hit the Earth okay so matter from Mars landed on the earth does that make sense that's how I gave you I have a lunar meteorite that I giving to you again as a as a as a token of my appreciation for all you do that came the same way something hit the moon blasted off some lunar it's called breia it's the crust of the Moon eventually made its way landed in northwest Africa and I bought a slice of it from a I got a dealer you know I got a meteorite dealer um and uh got that for you okay um so what's the lesson material gets exchanged from planet to planet now I asked the following question if that happened on the Mars to the Earth the moon to the earth so too has material from the earth been ejected since life emerged 3.7 billion years ago there's literally millions of tons of Earth that's floating around in space some of that will have landed on Mars so someday we'll get there we'll find some piece of it now could it some of it have a tardigrade on it could some of it have a protozoa on it obviously it could um and maybe some interesting mic microbes yeah it could maybe some ancient microbes that are no longer that's right um extent yeah it could it could have what's an adaptogen I I have no idea an adapt you talk about adaptogens adaptogens are it's it's a broad term used to describe um any compound that allows you to modulate the stress response so maybe increase your stress threshold or recover from stress more quickly it's it's sort of like saying stimulant no you know it's a broad category I mean I think you know some people say like you know certain nonhallucinogenic mushroom strains or adaptogens I mean the ability to to buffer the stress response um I mean things like riola have been described as adaptogens and these work through neurotransmitter systems so broadly speaking they allow you to um perceive effort as less effortful this kind of thing okay yeah so one theory of the formation of life on Earth you you asked me about that earlier the origin of life on Earth is a huge mystery how did life get here one proposition was made by Fred Hoy and other people sounds dirty but it's not it's called pans spermia just means that genetic material has been transferred from another um another astronomical object landed here on Earth so uh the converse reaction occurs as well but the the the fact is we don't observe it even on Mars so if I told you you know we've discovered a planet and there's another planet right next to it it has almost the same conditions it's in the so-called goldilock Zone where the temperatur is just right to have liquid water which Mars can have on it at certain times of the year and certain places on Mars it had flowing water on it we know for sure Mars had flowing water on it we know for sure that material from the earth got there when Earth had life on it so the absence of Life on Mars is a data point it's not pro probative or probative or just positive rather that life couldn't exist on Mars we haven't searched all of Mars but it at least shows there there's an impediment to it so people are lot fond of saying as I told you earlier there's about 10 to the 24th um planets probably in our observable universe going back to the Big Bang going out to the farthest reaches of the universe but even if you just take the Milky Way Galaxy there's probably you know literally 10 Bill hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy alone and um when you look at that people like to say as Carl Sean did if there's no life it's an awful waste of space right why is there so much space and there's no life that seems incomprehensible but nature you know I love when atheist scientists will say like you propose God exist and that's the god of the gaps to explain things that you don't understand but when science advances we'll have an explanation for why you know Thunder occurs it's not because of Thor right we get rid of gods as we learn more and so the god gaps shrink smaller and smaller but they'll say the same argument about life in the they'll say well there's God to be life because there's so much room there but as I told you I've been in Antarctica twice the only life forms I saw there okay were people um I saw a few penguins in the distance and a couple of dead sea lions there's no trees there's no Flora at all on the entire continent it's incredibly Barren and yet Andrew it makes up 8% of the of the land mass of the Earth wow and you would think well it's just proportional to the amount of area I.E the number of stars there should be 8% of the life on Earth there should be a billion people there whatever you know 600 million PE no there's nothing there except for scientists that go there so the the odds of life you know are you can't construct probability from possibility that and many many other arguments that I could give you the the the improbability of Life how hard it is to create life and you know if you just sprinkled imagine you had a koala Cannon okay people like Peta are going to get you just go to Mars and spray it with koala it's obviously not going to like would probably be okay with you populating with the an area with koalas a Canon to take out koalas they would probably that's right they would not like that so yeah so probab uh you know possibility is not probability uh the number number of hurdles to create a a single cell is enormous uh we have yet to reproduce you know to make a functional cell in the laboratory not that that's a requirement to prove that life could Exist Elsewhere just saying it's very hard our history of life we have an N of one it's very difficult to speculate on and if we're alone if if life is abundant as fery asked many many many years ago um if life is abundant and the Galaxy is is old where are they where are the aliens there should have been plenty of time not only for them to evolve and and be superior to us in many ways and travel the distances of the of our our galaxy not even of the cosmos of our galaxy where are they where are they they've known about us for 80 years because we've been broadcasting radio waves for the last 85 years do you know this theory about the gut microbiota you know our our guts our skin our eyes our nose but certainly our D entire digestive tract um the whole way down from our lips um out the other end our populated with these little microbiota that influence everything from fatty acid production neurotransmitter production Etc influence more than human cells right yeah oh yeah and it's powerful for modulating all sorts of biological processes and um and every time we interact shake hands if people kiss if you interact with dirt if you interact with a pet you the the microbiome changes it's a it's an inner uh reflection of of all your outer behaviors and internet yeah yeah and then we're learning a lot about it that there's this one theory that I like that um kind of turns life as as you and I know it on its head which is that um humans and other species are just vehicles for the microbiome and that you know and so you would take something like the desire to uh like like uh populate Mars or to shoot or to land on the moon as just the microbiota you know taking advantage of this weird old world primate species that we call Homo sapiens that loves to develop technology almost destroy itself but then continue to to uh evolve social media Etc warn each other about declining birth rates and then just to to basically the microbiota have a what you know a sort of quote unquote Consciousness not a brain but consciousness of their own which is like all species to make more of itself go further and further out and populate it's hard to punch holes in the logic of this of this model but it it certainly diminishes our our conscious experience um we could go on forever about uh this Trail I I'll just kind of put a kind of a cliffhanger out there it'd be wonderful sometime to sit down with you and discuss the possibility of rather than thinking about life elsewhere in the Galaxy given what we know about physics and Engineering astronomy Etc would it be be possible to build a planet at the appropriate distance from the Sun that we could spawn Life by bringing things there as opposed to trying to take it you know figure out how to how to do it at a at a distance that it might not be amendable to life right you know maybe creating a garden Planet maybe we don't put humans there right away um but trying to create a garden that could Thrive at the some appropriate distance from the Sun um and seeing what what what nutrients could be grown there you know so you could have robots man this this planet but you'd have to somehow aggre um stuff in space to build this planet or launch this planet up that it would collect things I mean that to me feels like a fun experiment and a lot less risky than going up up to other planets um yeah I was I was blessed as my first guest on the anth The Impossible podcast that Freeman Dyson now you mentioned with your dad your dad mentioned him uh one of the greatest intellects of the of the last hundred years great physicist and he had these ideas for these Dyson spheres which would be you know uh energy harvesting so the first you know ingredient that you need to construct the the Hu you Planet uh uh habitable zone is to have uh is have energy it Harvest as much energy as possible from a star so he he basically conjectured a a mega structure an alien mega structure that could be observable by astronomers could detect these these objects and and some have claimed that we have but those have always been refuted and it would be basically surrounding a star capturing every Photon worth of energy that came out of it and then converting that to mechanical energy and then yes and then once you have Infinite Energy you can actually do Fusion you could make up whatever molecules you want you could make up you know print 3D printing at the at the Quark level on up basically and so that was his you know conjecture of how super Advanced aliens would behave but again we have no evidence for it but it's fun it's certainly fun to have the science fiction you know kind of you know a lot of interesting science you know originates from ideas and creativity that originates from science fiction so that would be a lot of fun you and I could talk about the Stars the planets Optics animals here on Earth um infinitely um this is what happens folks when two real uh real nerds get together and want to learn from one another and I hope U you delighted in this at least um half as much as I did uh those of you listening um I mean you occupy an incredible place and I mean that you know like your your intellectual place since you were a child is is a remarkable place um that most people I think don't occupy not because they don't have the training but because they just haven't put their mind on there on these questions and I think one thing that's so clear is that through your podcast your books and certainly through the discussion today um you've placed Us in the in the position of scientist um to be able to let Ponder these these really big questions about really big really distant things is is not typically the way that my brain uh functions I think most people are uh more focused on things proximal to them and and here on here on Earth but I'm so grateful that you that you did and um and I'm so grateful that you continue to educate we didn't even get to talk about but I'll just mention that you've been a absolutely spectacular proponent for um Popular Science Education and the importance of that I've been very inspired by you and your work thank you uh very inspired by your story um sure because of some similarities and you know Fathers and Sons and the tribulations Etc different but some some overlap there but also just because of the way that you approach life um and it's very clear to me that as a person who's focused on things very very far away where apparently there there's no observable life yet not yet um that you're also very grounded in in this thing that we call daily life and the Delight of of of exploration and asking questions and uh if ever there was a a call to arms for people to get outside and look at the stars perhaps through a telescope or perhaps through the telescopes on the front of their their skull um certainly to do that and to think about some of what was discussed today because I I'm certainly Enchanted and I I know those listening and watching are as well so thank you for everything you do keep doing it come back let's keep talking we didn't talk about God in the universe and um the origins of life but we'll do that before long and uh Brian keing thanks for being you I appreciate you thanks Andrew you've been a big inspiration to me too and you know use your language thank you for your interest in science it's really done uh so much for the world and you give it all for free and it's uh it's truly an inspiration and it's really fun to talk to somebody who's you know at the level that you're at and so many different things and still has that you know as scientist we get inured we get kind of used to things oh there's a rainbow there's a meteor you know whatever but you still have that passion you have that passion that Curiosity and I think that's what makes a true scientist and the the function of Education seems to beat that out of kids but um but really to have that in the domain and the expertise that you have is is a real inspiration and I think it's a huge service to society so I want to thank you too thank you well it's a labor of love mixed within Affliction so we'll keep going right back at you thanks Brian thanks Andrew thank you for joining me for today's discussion

Title: How to Talk to Your Kids About Difficult Emotions
Published: 2025-01-18 19:44:48 UTC
Description:
Dr. Becky Kennedy discusses the importance of acknowledging and appropriately communicating emotions to children, emphasizing that it is not the sadness itself that destabilizes kids, but rather the absence of a truthful narrative around those emotions.

Transcript Language: English
If I'm sad, my kid is going to notice. What do I do then? The patterns we set with our kids when they're young inform their view of the world when they're older. And so here I am, let's say it's the situation of somebody dying and I'm upset. First of all, as a parent, tell yourself, "It's not my kid seeing me sad that's going to destabilize them, it's seeing me sad, and me making up a bogus story or denying it," because then my kid goes, "Pretty sure my mom was upset. Oh, she's not? Oh, she's pretending like nothing happened. Oh, she looks sad, but she's saying she's not sad." That is really upsetting. It would be like hearing your boss say, "Oh, yeah, 20% layoffs. What are we doing, I dunno. Oh, hi, everything's great. How are you?" Like, what is happening? Scary. What you'd want is your boss to say, "You just heard something. You were right to hear that. We are about to go through a really tough time. I'm stressed about it, that's why I yelled. You might be stressed. Here's what I know. This is going to be hard and we're going to get through it together." Now, all of a sudden, that emotional experience has a container. It has a story. Humans need stories, we like stories. And so often we think it's the emotions that dysregulate a kid. It's the lack of a story to explain it.

Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain strategies for managing stress, both in the short and long term, to enhance overall well-being.

I explain how the mind and body respond to stress and how acute stress has immune-boosting benefits. I discuss science-supported tools and supplements to better manage stress in real time and protocols for raising one's stress threshold to build resilience to life’s inevitable challenges. I also describe practices to reduce chronic stress and maintain a balanced, healthy life. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

welcome to hubman Labb Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode is going to be all about the science of emotions and today we're going to talk in particular about something that most often is called stress now you might be thinking wait stress isn't an emotion but stress really lies at the heart of whether or not our internal experience is matched well or not to our external experience or the events that are happening to us and around us and as you'll soon see those converge or combine to create what we call emotions I'd like you to come away from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic a framework for think about these things that typically we just call happy or sad or depressed or anxious and I'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded in physiology and Neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex space that we call emotions that will allow you to ground yourself better when you're feeling like life is Weighing on you or you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life as well as to support other people whether or not that's in a psychological practice if you're if you're a practitioner or you have clients or children or spouses really to be able to support other people in your environment better and as you may recall the nervous system which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord but also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the brain and body and those organs of the body your gut and your liver and your spleen they are also communicating with the brain so I look forward to a day in fact when we no longer think about Neuroscience as just the brain and many neuroscientists now also think about the body of course the brain controls the body but the body is also having a very profound and concrete influence on the brain today we're going to talk about objective tools that match the brain body experience or separate the brain body experience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better to feel better literally to just feel better about what you're experiencing and believe it or not to be able to control your emotions when that's appropriate okay so what is stress we hear all the time that stress is bad we hear people saying they're really stressed out what is stress stress at its core is a generalized system it wasn't designed for tiger tigers attacking us or people attacking us it's a system to mobilize other systems in the brain and body it wasn't designed for one thing thing and that gives it a certain advantage in taking over our the state of our brain and body but it also gives you all of us an advantage in controlling it because it's based on hardwired biological mechanisms and there are hardwired biological mechanisms meaning cells and chemicals and Pathways and tissues that exist in you right now that require no neuroplasticity that allow you to put a break on stress and so we're going to talk about those so let's talk about the stress response and by doing that you will understand exactly why the tools I'm going to give you work for those of you that are saying wait I just want the tools just give me a summary trust me if you understand mechanism you are going to be in a far better position to incorporate these tools to teach these tools to others and to modify them as your life circumstances change let's be clear about what we already know which is that stressors can be psychological or they can be physical okay if I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket for a very long time that is stressful if I have you prepare for too many exams at once and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule and your other needs for comfort and well-being like food rest sleep and social connection that is stressful so what happens when the stress response hits let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress response response we could also think of this as short-term stress so you have a collection of neurons that start right about at your neck and run down to about your navl a little bit lower and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia when something stresses us out either in our mind or because something enters our environment that chain of neurons becomes activated like a bunch of dominoes falling all at once it's very fast when those neurons are activated cocoline is released but there are some other neurons for the afficionados out there they're called the postganglionic neurons those ones respond to that acetylcholine and then they release epinephrine which is the equivalent to Adrenaline so we have this system where very fast whenever we're stressed the core of our body these neurons down the middle of our body release these chemicals and then there's adrenaline or epinephrine released at particular organs and acts in particular ways some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart and other things that need to be active when you're stressed they have a certain kind of receptor which is called the beta receptor and that beta receptor responds to epinephrine and blood vessels dilate they get bigger and blood rushes into to our legs the heart rate speeds up lots of things happen that get activated and at the same time that epinephrine activates other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need the ones involved in digestion reproduction and things of that sort that are luxuries for when things are going well not things to pay attention to when we're stressed so the stress response is too pronged it's a yes for certain things and it's a know you may not right now for other things that's why you feel blood in certain organs and tissues of your body but not in others but basically you are activated in ways that support you moving and that's because fundamentally the stress response is just this generic thing that says do something you're going to feel agitated and that's because it was designed to move you so this is important because if you want to control stress you need to learn how to work with that agitation I'd like to give you a tool at this point because I think if we go any further with a lot more science people are going to uh begin to wonder if this is just going to be a kind of standard university lecture sure about the stress response if you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response the best thing you can do is activate the other system in the body which is designed for calming and relaxation and that system is called the parasympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves the ones that are up in the brain stem and in the neck area those have a direct direct line to various features of your face in particular the eyes they control things like eye movements pupil dilation things of that sort as well as the tongue the facial muscles Etc so I'm going to teach you the first tool now so I don't overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge without giving you something useful and the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded in physiology and Neuroscience for calming down in a self-directed way is What's called the physiological sigh s g what I'm talking about when I refer to physiological size is the very real medical school textbook relationship between the brain the body and the body as it relates to the breathing apparate ey meaning the diaphragm and lungs and the Heart let's take the Hallmark of the stress response the heart starts beating faster blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the body to move move you away from whatever it is this stressor is or just make you feel like you need to move or talk your face goes flushed Etc there is however a way in which you can breathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interactions between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system here's how it works when you inhale so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth this skeletal muscle that's inside your body called the diaphragm it moves down and that's because the lungs expand the diaphragm moves down your heart actually gets a little bit bigger in that expanded space there's more space for the heart and as a consequence whatever blood is in there is now at a lower volume or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume than it was before you inhaled okay so more space heart gets bigger blood moves more slowly and there's a little group of neurons called the sinoatrial node in the heart that registers it's pay believe it or not those neurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart and send a signal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through the heart the brain then sends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up so what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster inhale longer inhale more vigorously than your exhales now the opposite is also true if you want to slow your heart rate down so stress response hits you want to slow your heart rate down what you want to do is again capitalize on this relationship between the body meaning the diaphragm in the heart and the Brain here's how it works when you exhale the diaphragm moves up which makes the heart a little bit smaller it actually gets a little more compact blood flows more quickly through that compact space the sinoatrial node registers that blood is going more quickly sends a signal up to the brain and the parasympathetic nervous system some neurons in your brain stem send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down so if you want to calm down quickly you need to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales now the reason this is so attractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time this doesn't involve a practice that you have to go and sit there and do anything separate from Life the phys ological sigh is something that people naturally start doing when they've been crying and they're trying to recover some air or calm down when they've been sobbing very hard or when they are in claustrophobic environments however the amazing thing about this thing that we call the diaphragm the skeletal muscle is that it's an internal organ that you can control voluntarily so this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm through What's called the frenic nerve p h re n i c frenic the frenic nerve innervates the diap you can control anytime you want you can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales you can exhale more than your inhales whatever you want to do such an incredible organ and the physiological sigh is something that we do spontaneously but when you're feeling stressed you can do a double inhale long exhale now I just told you a minute ago that if you inhale more than you exhale you're going to speed the heart rate up which would promote more stress and activation now I'm telling you to do a double inhale exhale in order to calm down and the reason is the double inhale exhale which is the physiological sigh takes advantage of the fact that when we do a double inhale even if the second inhale is sneaking in just a tiny bit more air because it's kind of hard to get two deep inhales back to back you do big deep inhale and then another little one sneaking it in the little sacks in your lungs the aoli of the lungs your lungs aren't just too big bags but you've got millions of little sacks throughout the the lungs that actually make the surface area of your lungs as big as a tennis court which is amazing if we were to spread that out those tend to collapse as we get stressed and carbon di carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream and that's one of the reasons we feel agitated as well but when you do the double inhale exhale the double inhale reinflates those little sacks of the lungs and then when you do the long exhale that long exhale is now much more effective at ridding your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide which relaxes you very quickly when you're feeling stressed the physiological side done just one to three times so it would be double inhale exhale double inhale exhale maybe just two times will bring down your level of stress very very fast and as far as I know it's the fastest way to accomplish that be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh or exhale emphasize breathing to calm down that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds to come down to basine and you may need to repeat the physiological s a few times so let's think about something now let's think about stress from not whether or not it's acute or chronic whether or not it's good for us or bad for us but on three different time scales because then we can arrive at what this is all about as it relates to emotions but I really want you to understand the difference between the three kinds of stress on three different time scills short-term medium-term and long-term and what it's good for and what it's bad for I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us we've seen these pictures intended to frighten us and indeed they are frightening you see the nice really plump brain on the left says healthy or control and then you see the brain that says stressed above it on the right and it's like withed or we see that the hippocampus an area involved in memory is smaller people that are stressed I think we've all heard now so many times that stress is bad but in that conversation unfortunately it's a lipsed some of the really positive things that stress does for us in the short term when the stress response hits that is good for your immune system I know that might be a tough pill to swallow but it's absolutely true in fact stress often comes in the form of bacterial or viral infection and the stress response is in part organized to combat bacterial and viral infection so short-term stress and the release of adrenaline in particular or epinephrine same thing adrenaline epinephrine is good for combating infection and this to me is just not discussed enough so that's why I'm discussing it here and it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about but I don't often get the opportunity to talk about in such an appropriate context it's not that it's ever inappropriate to talk about but what I'm about to talk about now is the use of again respiration breathing to somewhat artificially activate the stress response and that will accomplish two things okay I'll return to medium and long-term stress but I want to say short-term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils the changes in the Optics of the eyes the quickening of the heart rate the sharpening of your cognition and in fact that short-term stress brings certain elements of the brain online that allow you to focus now it Narrows your focus you're not good at seeing the so-called big picture but it Narrows your focus because it allows you to do these what I call duration path outcome types of analysis it allows you to evaluate your environment evaluate what you need to do it primes your whole system for better cognition it primes your immune system to combat infection and that all makes sense when you think about the fact that famine thirst bacterial infections viral infections Invaders all of this stuff liberates a response in the body that's designed to get you to fight back about against whatever stressor that happens to be psychological physical bacterial viral again the stress response is generic the tool takes advantage of the fact that when adrenaline is released in the body from the adrenals it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs in particular from the spleen but from elsewhere as well and interactions with the lymphatic system that combat infection the way this works in the real world is best captured by a study that can be mapped back to so called Wim Hoff breathing now Wim Hoff breathing is so named after the so-called Iceman Wim Hoff there are two components to a sort of breathing protocol that he developed that was based also on what's called Tumo breathing TMO so before whim there was Tumo breathing and many people call this now super oxygenation breathing so it's deliberate hyperventilation why would somebody want to do this well deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 Cycles so inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale that pattern of breathing rapid movements of the diaphragm will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals when adrenaline is released in the body you are in a better position to combat infections and so whether or not you breathe very quickly in these cycles of 25 breaths and regardless of what you call it doesn't matter adrenaline is released if you take a cold shower adrenaline is released if you go into an ice bath deliberately and even if you do it non- deliberately adrenaline is released you are mimicking the stress response and that adrenaline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections and this was beautifully shown in a study that was published in a very fine journal the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for the US it's it literally called proceedings of the naal Academy USA to distinguish it from other proceedings of other National academies in other countries the way the experiment went is that people were injected with endotoxin or in some cases they were injected with with a bacterial wall that mimics infection it g it gives you a fever it makes you feel nauseous it makes you feel sick it is not pleasant half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing that looked very much like the pattern of breathing I described a moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales and exhales followed by an exhale holding their breath then repeating 25 inhales exhales holding their breath so this would look something like this or if you're listening it sounds like 25 30 times you'll start feeling heated up you'll start feeling the adrenaline response you're liberating adrenaline in your body then exhale hold your breath for 15 seconds and then repeat now I want to emphasize never ever ever do this anywhere near water people have passed out so-called shallow water bra out people have died please don't do it at all unless you get clearance to do it from your doctor because there are some pulmonary effects and whatnot and the breath holds should definitely not be done by anyone that has glaucoma or pressure uh you know concerns for the eyes but these repeated cycles of breathing that liberate adrenaline allowed the group that did that protocol to essentially experience zero symptoms from the injection of this ecoli which is remarkable they had much reduced or no symptoms they didn't feel feverish they didn't feel sick they weren't vomiting no diarrhea which is remarkable but makes total sense when you think about the fact that the short-term stress response that what's typically called the acute stress response is designed to combat all stressors many of us are familiar with the experience of work work work work work or taking care of a loved one or stress stress stress stress stress then we finally relax maybe we even go on vacation like oh now I'm finally going to get the break and then we get sick and that's because the adrenaline response crashed and your immune system crashed with it so please understand this now many of you might say well how long is it 2 hours is it 3 hours a lot of you out there that really like specificity it will vary for everybody I would just kind of use a rule of thumb when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep what good sleep means to you please see the episodes on sleep if you want more about tools to sleep when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress you need to be able to turn the stress response off okay so now let's talk about medium-term stress medium-term stress is going to be stress that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks what is stress threshold well stress threshold is actually our ability to cognitively regulate what's going on in our body a lot of stress inoculation a lot of managing medium-term stress on the on the time scale of weeks or maybe even a couple months so we're not talking about years of stress a lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold it's about capacity and there are very simple tools excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress and they look a lot like the tools I just described they involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat not to the extreme and then when we are feel flooded with adrenaline and normally we would Panic it's about cognitively mentally emotionally calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body and what would this look like you can use the cyclic hyper oxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down and there is also a way in which you can use things like cold showers or if you exercise and you bring your heart rate up very high you kind of go into that high intensity realm where your heart is beating a little bit harder than you're comfortable with the key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated one way that you can do this and this is kind of fun if it's approved by your physician and you're able to do this you can bring your heart rate up you could do this through an ice bath if that's your thing or a cold shower or cyclic oxygenation breathing or you could Sprint or you could go hard on the bike whatever is that brings your heart rate up and then what you want to do is you want to actually try and calm the mind while your body is in this heightened state of activation when we are stressed our pupils dilate the effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision it literally Narrows our view of the visual world we no longer see in Panorama and there's some other effects as well but that's because the visual system through this cranial nerve system that I described before is Tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system by deliberately dilating your gaze meaning not moving your head and eyes around but by deliberately going from tunnel vision to broader panoramic Vision literally seeing more of your environment all at once it creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular circuit in the brain stem that's associated with alertness AKA stress now this is very powerful if you're running for instance and you're at Max Capacity you're close to it or you're kind of hitting like 80 90% of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze what you'll find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output and this is um relates to work that in various communities people are are working with this in the sports Community military communities Etc but it's a form not really of stress inoculation it's more about raising stress threshold so that the body is going to continue to be in a high alertness high reactivity mode high output but the mind is calm and so this isn't about you unifying mind and body this is actually about using body to bring up your level of activation then dissociating not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders but dissociating the mental or emotional response from what's going on in your body and over time so if you do this you know a couple times you don't have to do this every workout but if you do this every maybe once a week or so you start being comfortable at these higher activation States what once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work now is manageable it feels tolerable so that's for navigating medium-term stress and then there's long-term stress now long-term stress is bad you do not want adrenaline up in your system for a very long time in fact you you ideally you would have your stress go up various times throughout the day but it would never stay elevated and it would never prevent you from getting a good night's sleep we know that chronic stress elevated stress and especially in the so-called type A personalities creates heart disease leading killer of for in most every country but in particular in the US but by no means do you want to be stressed out all the time chronically for months and months and months and years on end the best tools the best mechanisms that we know to modulate long-term stress might surprise you a little bit first of all there are going to be the things that don't surprise you which is everyone knows getting regular exercise getting good sleep um using realtime tools to try and Tamp down the stress response Etc that's all going to be really useful the data really point to the fact that social connection and certain types of social Connection in particular are what are going to mitigate or reduce long-term stress and this is a particularly important issue nowadays where we have all these proxies or surrogates for social connection you know online and texting with people a lot everyone has this kind of need to stay connected to one another humans are incredibly social creatures the way to think about social connection and how it can mitigate some of the long-term effects of stress is really through the systems of neuromodulation like serotonin serotonin again is a neuromodulator neuromodulators are a little bit like playist in the brain they tend to amplify or bias the likelihood that certain brain circuits and body circuits are going to be activated and that others will not serotonin generally gives us feelings of well-being at very high levels it makes us feel blissed and it tends to make us feel like we have enough in our immediate environment when we see somebody that we recognize and Trust serotonin is released in the brain and that has certain positive effects on the immune system and on other systems of neural repair and and synapses and things that really reinforce Connections in the brain and prevent that long-term withering of connections so serot on is tied to social connection now social connection can take many forms some of those can be romantic attachments those could be familial attachments that are non-romantic friendship pets even attachments to things that just Delight us having a sense of delight a sense of really enjoying something that you see and engage in witness or participate in that is associated with the serotonin system and certainly play is one of those things social connection of various forms those are things to invest in I'll be the first to admit social connection and friendship and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans or inanimate objects takes work it takes investment it takes time in not needing everything to be exactly the way you want it to be social connection is something that we work for but it is incredibly powerful finding just a few people even one or an animal or something that you Delight in believe it or not has very positive effects on mitigating this long-term stress on improving various aspects of our life as it relates to stress and emotionality now how do you know if you're making serotonin you don't know in the moment but you can learn if you pay attention to kind of recognize these feelings of comfort trust Bliss delight and those are not weak terms those are not associated just with uh psychological terms they are they are every bit as physiological as the movement of your muscles or the secretion of adrenaline now there are a plethora of things that will also impact well-being and allow you to mod modulate your long-term stress reduce the likelihood that you'll engage in long-term stress there are compounds that are not prescription compounds that can modulate the stress system and sometimes because of the way that life is we just don't have the opportunity to control life and to control our response to stress the three I want to focus on and one that I think you need to be cautious about that I've mentioned before include ashwagandha eleanine and melatonin let's talk about melatonin first melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal in direct relationship to how much Darkness you are in not emotional Darkness but light suppresses melatonin melatonin helps you fall asleep it doesn't help you stay asleep I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin because it's supplemented typically at very high levels you know 1 to 3 milligrams or even more that is an outrageous iously high doses also has a number of potentially negative effects on the reproductive axis and and hormones there the other is Aline I've talked about Aline which provided it's safe for you can be taken 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams about a 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep it can enhance the transition to sleep and depth of sleep for many people it increases Gaba this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain it tends to turn off our forbrain a little bit or reduce the activity of our kind of thinking systems and ruminating systems help people fall asleep but theanine has also been shown for people that are chronically anxious or chronically stressed to significantly increase relaxation it is known to have a minor effect on anxiety but eight Studies have shown that it definitely has a notable effect on stress the other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha ashwagandha is known to lower anxiety and cortisol this is great I mean the opportunity for me anyway to be able to take something that can help me reduce my cortisol so that I don't get some of the long-term effects of stress and I'm not going to take ashwaganda year round I would only do this if I was feeling like I wasn't managing my short and medium-term stress well so I don't take it on a regular basis I do take it when I'm in these times when things are particularly stressful so social connection and some supplementation of course diet exercise sleep for long-term stress so I hope today you were able to take a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress not just see it as evil but see it as power powerful and useful in certain contexts great for us in certain contexts and problematic in other contexts and as well to think about the various tools that I've presented that can allow you to adjust and modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness so that you can lean more effectively into life which includes sleep and social connection and the work you have to do and of course acknowledges that the events in the world are beyond our control what's in our control is how we react to them something that's ly said in the wellness and self-help and psychology world but for which there often aren't as many concrete tools that we can really look to and Trust in real time as always really appreciate your time and attention today I hope you practice some of the tools if they're right for you I hope you think hard about stress and how you can control your stress and above all as always thank you for your interest in science [Music]

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Becky Kennedy Dr Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist and one of the world's foremost experts in parent child relationships now you may or may not have children if you do today's episode is absolutely for you if you don't well you were once a child perhaps you're even still a child today's episode also will have valuable knowledge and tools that you can apply to your life today Dr Becky Kennedy teaches us an immense number of extremely valuable tools for the workplace for romantic relationships for family relationships of all types not just parent child relationships and of course also for parent child relationships we discuss themes that have not been discussed previously on the hubman Lab podcast topics such as guilt which Dr Becky Kennedy offers a completely unique perspective on one that I've never heard before and that frankly I don't think anyone has heard before in fact she distinguishes between what most people think is guilt and an entirely different set of emotions and offers you very useful practical tools for when you experience guilt and how to work with guilt we also extensively discuss frustration or what she calls frustration tolerance frustration tolerance is an extremely important theme for everybody to understand and apply in their lives because frustration tolerance as Dr Becky Kennedy so aply points out is Central to the learning process of anything at every age if you can understand this concept and you apply some of the very simple rules and tools that Dr Kennedy explains during the podcast I assure you you can learn many more things much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction if not during the process certainly at the end when you master that learning and those are just a few of the themes that we discussed during today's episode again whether or not you have children I assure you that today's episode is going to be immensely beneficial for all of your relationships you will notice during today's episode that our studio backdrop is different you will notice that for once I was not wearing this particular style of shirt the reason for that is that this episode was recorded during the LA fires what was initially called the Palisades fire and then spread to multiple fires throughout LA County so we were not able to access our normal studio so I want to express extreme gratitude to Rich Ro our good friend in the podcasting space who allowed us to use his podcast Studio which is where I'm seated now and where I held the discussion with Dr Becky Kennedy first off our entire team our homes and our studio are fine I can assure you of that but most importantly our thoughts and our prayers go out to the people who have lost their homes lost pets and sadly there have been fatalities during the LA fires so our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and we hope everyone remains safe before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme today's episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with Dr Becky Kennedy Dr Becky Kennedy welcome back I'm so happy to be here grateful to Rich R for Lending us his Studio under the duress of fires in Los Angeles I'm praying that his home is okay um it's unclear at this moment but in any event let's talk about emotions both theory and practice and if we can place it in the context of parenting that would be great but I'm certain that this has a broader theme that pertains to everybody so I love the theory of emotions or how we would theoretically respond to something but then there's the reality so as a parent let's say um you have a stance in your home and in your family that it's okay to be safe sad like sadness is normal it happens it passes Etc but let's say you're feeling particularly sad about something do you express that and show that in front of your kids because I've also heard that young kids in particular younger than eight or nine perhaps shouldn't be aware that their parents are experiencing say extreme sadness because it can be scary to them where they might feel like their world is destabilizing and then um we ALS hear a lot about kids feeling like they had to parent the parents and then this whole thing becomes pretty complicated so while there's no perfect world where um one knows what to do every single time how do you look at this business of modeling emotions and also encouraging kids to be able to experience and express their emotions yeah and I think everything I'm about to share applies you know in the workplace right like can of Boss be you know really upset in front of the person they manage management right so it's all the same stuff so I guess zooming out as a start emotions are normal emotions are unstoppable you can't not feel sad just because you have your 5-year-old in the room right and I think the other thing that kind of forms my perspective is it's really hard to not show someone that you're sad like you might think you're doing that well but kids are extra perceptive they are actually built to be more per receptive than we are because their survival depends on adults so they have to always notice is my adult around is my adult okay so they really attune to what's going on for us right and so I think the kind of question is less do I show my emotions to my kid or not and it's more okay if I'm sad my kid is going to notice what do I do then and as a principle one of the things I think about often is information doesn't scare kids as much as the absence of information scares kids so let's say there's let's say there's something really awful I don't know as a parent you're your family member someone died of cancer I don't know there's something really horrible that you just found out right there's wildfires right now let's say you evacuated and you found out your house burned down you're sad your child is going to notice that and you want your child to notice that you don't want your kid to be a teenager and adult who goes around the world unable to pick up on emotional cues from other people that that that's not adaptive and so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young inform their view of the world when they're older and so here I am let's say it's the situation of somebody dying and I'm upset first of all as a parent tell yourself it's not my kid seeing me sad that's going to destabilize them it's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story or denying it because then my kid goes pretty sure my mom was upset oh she's not oh she's pretending like nothing happened oh she looks sad but she's saying she's not sad that is really upsetting it would be like hearing your boss say oh yeah 20% layoffs what are we doing I don't know oh hi everything's great how are you like what is happening scary what you'd want is your boss say you just heard something you were right to hear that we are about to go through a really tough time I'm stressed about it that's why I yelled you might be stressed here's what I know this is going to be hard and we're going to get through it together now all of a sudden that emotional experience has a container it has a story humans need Stories We like stories and so often we think it's the emotions that dis regulate a kid it's the lack of a story to explain it so let's say this really did happen people always say to me okay but Dr Becky like my kid is four I'm going to say that their aunt died they don't even know cancer right we don't have a better alternative I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen whose kids have all of these issues because of the madeup stories I just said she went to sleep for a while 6 months later my kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night yeah they haven't seen their aunt who went to sleep one time you know creates a huge issue no matter what bogus story you make up kids can handle the truth and they can handle the truth when it's told to them from a loving trusted adult it's kind of like me and you someone can tell us a hard truth but it's from someone you feel safe with and that you feel like also believes in you and says it honestly it might be hard but it doesn't feel awful so it's about saying to your kid you saw me crying one of my favorite kind of sentences to say to kids around this cuz I think it really builds their confidence it's just you were right to notice that I was crying and I'm feeling sad and look you saw that I'm going to tell you why making this up a Aunt Sally died do you know what dying means dying is when someone's body stops working then I'd pause right this one to be a monologue I'll see how my kid responds I might add I'm not dying kids actually really need to hear that in hard times I'm not dying no one else is dying I'm safe and you know what I'm sad and I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you that sets the stage for such resilience and is kind of the opposite of everything's fine my kid keeps seeing me crying they keep hearing words they're not used to hearing die cancer Aunt Sally funeral whatever it is that situation is what makes kids feel really really uncomfortable and unsafe so it's the absence of information that causes the harm yeah and it's the lack of coherence between what they're observing and feeling and kind of this like open loop um if I kind of place it in neuroscienc terms I feel like the brain does think in the terms of in terms of stories stories have a beginning middle and an end and they kind of want to know where where they are in that story that's exactly right and the terms I would use for to match your terms are um coherent narrative what is therapy why does therapy help people it's interesting therapy doesn't change what happened to you therapy doesn't change your past therapy does not take away the pain but the pain was never the thing that really got in our way it was the pain plus a lack of a coherent narrative and support and so early on when kids have Painful experiences from witnessing you or something else giving them a coherent narrative is what they need and without that the way I think about it is they have what I call unformulated experience it's just affect an experience that kind of free floats in their body unformulated that tends to later show up as triggers right and kind of other things in adulthood and so yeah that's what we want to try to avoid when we can I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors wealthfront I've been using wealthfront for for my savings and my investing for

zero risk I can't help but put this Neuroscience lens on this cuz I find it so interesting that what you're basically saying if I understand correctly is that until we can place things into a story which is really a sense of beginning middle and end a sense of time it just reverberates in US I mean I think I can't help myself you know we we've I don't want to give the impression we've got fires burning all around us in terms of this building but with some distance between us and the fires that's actually true and I think one of the things that's so uh destabilizing for kids and adults in this this kind of circumstance is that we don't know how this is going to work out we just don't and of course none of us have a crystal ball uh we can't peer into the future yeah but it's the not knowing that you know really extends our brain resources and I can imagine that for a kid seeing their parent upset and then hearing well no I'm okay I'm okay um would create this kind of open loop where then the kid has to worry about it like like when will this come to an end um one question about expressing sadness in front of a a child and if let's say somebody expresses why they're sad is it okay to AC to accept um consolation from the kid because we hear so much that you know we shouldn't have to parent um as children we shouldn't have to parent our parents and this is a big theme especially on social media nowadays like were were you the parent to your parent you know were you the one that took out the trash when someone else should have done it and therefore you took on more responsibilities I don't want kids to think they shouldn't take out the trash but you know what I mean or but if you're calling a parent about a lost job if you're the parent the kid rather that is sort of goet between the parents is sort of acting as therapist we we hear about this a lot a lot and I think a lot of people peer into their past and and say yeah I I did I grew up way too fast yeah so on the other hand I think we would all agree that being a empathic person um teaching our kids that if somebody's crying you walk over to that person perhaps and just say you know do you want me to sit with you or maybe do nothing at all maybe offer a solution maybe not but at least you know provide some sort of support that seems healthy but the basic question is should parents accept consolation from children when the parent is sad or experiencing some other negative emotion I think this is a great question there's a couple things that are coming to mind so first of all all of this is a matter of extent and patterning yes we do not want our kids to feel like it is their job to take care of our emotions it's not a good situation and I think the difference here actually comes down to what the true definition of empathy is to me empathy is noticing someone's feelings and caring about them it's not taking care of them that's a big difference so let's say I'm crying and my kid comes over and this whole situation maybe somebody died and like oh my goodness mom can I give you a hug and do you want me to get you a cup of water okay I just want parents know you don't say no no I do not want you to be a parentified child like like that is so that is so kind yes that would feel great okay that's totally fine I think the line is and every parent just knows this forsel where it might get to oh you know what I love that you're noticing I'm sad and I love that you care about that and I also want to let you know those are my feelings not yours and I am really able to take care of them myself with whoever is a friend um and you're still really allowed to be a kid who can go play who can go have fun who can even not listen to me once in a while when I say it's bath time that's actually your job so let's go do our jobs well and to me that comes down to what empathy is the delineation of like what is a parents job and what is a kids job um but also I think all of this can get misrepresented in this in social media and I don't want parents to think that they always have to chastise their kid for acting in a caring way yeah I feel like kids are as you said before kids are so perceptive about what their parents are experiencing and they'll create or move towards all sorts of um emotional gymnastics in order to work with that years ago I saw I think it was a YouTube video with Jim Carrey who basically revealed that he became funny as a way to make his sick mom laugh that he grew up with a very sick mom which is chronically ill and so he would like throw himself down the stairs and try and make her laugh or do you know he was an incredible like world class physical comic um among other aspects of of Comedy but that his whole career was born out of this childhood tendency to notice that his mom was really hurting and try and basically make her laugh make her feel something good and it you know now I'm thinking about this because it's just incredible the way that kids can pick up on something and then and try and find a solution to it yeah you know I could imagine that for kids who have a sick parent could be a mental um challenges or physical challenges that they've got to notice yes and um in the case of Jim Carrey one could argue whether or not it was adaptive or not adaptive he had this you know meteoric career but um eventually just left it decided that wasn't what what he wanted to do um but leaving that extreme example aside let's say a parent is sick with the flu or is grieving the loss of you know God forbid a spouse or um or or something really major yeah uh at what point does the parent need to say listen I'm really hurting this is bad and I can handle it when that might not actually be true so the question is you know uh how how much information to give kids yeah because you don't want to lie to them on the other hand you don't want them to feel the burden of of needing to worry about a circumstance and I'm framing this in the context of sick parent but I'm also raising this thing of um Financial worries a close friend um who told me that growing up their parent was like constantly dealing with you know moving from one job to the next it was like this issue of whether or not we're going to have enough resources to get through the next year was a constant question and this person is now in their mid-30s and you you can tell it still haunts them and it's completely shaped their relationship to work and finances yeah yeah I mean I think we can we can think about this compared to what would I want from my boss I have a boss who's I don't know going through a really hard time or having a really hard time at home and I kind of notice it I'd probably want my boss to level with me and say kind of again you're right to notice I'm going through a hard time but at what point would it feel like o am I safe in this organization right I I I I think we probably all have a point there and I think it's the same thing with kids kids really do need to feel like they have sturdy parents again I always go back to Pilots because I think airplane examples are so powerful because there's very few times in adulthood that we actually feel like our safety is truly dependent on another adult like 100% when you're a passenger in an airplane you are 100% dependent so it's kind of the closest Dynamic and you can imagine what it would be like if the was saying going through a really hard time who wants to come in and give me you know I don't know you know tell me a nice story like oh my goodness like I okay you're going through a hard time but this is really not feeling great right um and what that means and which is you know kind of even a larger point is if you're a pilot you need to make sure you're really doing a lot of self-care more than the average person because of this outsized responsibility you have this is what I think about parenting and it's why from you know bigger theme Here is this is what gets me out of bed you know every morning so motivated is not just to help parents understand Tantrums or emotions or you know the latest struggle in their house although I actually love that it's to say hold on like we've been really sold like an awful story about what it really means to be a parent and how parenting really first and foremost is a journey of self-care how can I be the sturdiest person possible who do I need in my life when things go poorly so so I don't lean on my young children and give them a responsibility that is not theirs you know I I was just saying to someone the other day that when you have kids all of the unhealed parts of your childhood come right before your eyes they are just triggered over and over and over with your own children like you know oh my kid's whining I can't deal with that oh well whining is probably trickling because it's kind of Representative of helplessness what was it like in my family if I kind of felt helpless was that allowed did I grow up in a you know if you don't stop crying I'll give you something to cry about family okay if I don't resolve that I'm going to act that all out on my children and pass that along so all of kind of these situations where parents are feeling all these different emotions from a trigger from something in their life I I think it goes to what I always tell parents you know you have a first and foremost job of self-care and taking care of yourself that doesn't mean traveling to Europe for the year and leaving your kids alone it means what is going on inside you what skills do you need what networks of support do you need what do you have around you to help you on the hardest journey of your life and the most rewarding one of being a parent so that you don't have to say to your kids you know oh you know can you kind of take care of me Paul kti who came on this podcast to do a a series about mental health not just mental challenges but also mental health which is an interesting Concept in its own right um has been quoted as saying that you know that if you were to list out the hundred most important things for romantic relationships it would be self-care and communication repeated 50 times and I'm thinking about that now because sounds like a pretty good model for pretty much every relationship yes self-care communication and I must say the first time I heard him say that it wasn't on uh my podcast it was on a different podcast sort of surprised I thought self-care first but the way you're framing it um seems to me that if self-care comes first or at least very high on the list of what parents should do it frees up the kids to live and experience life with a lot more ease yeah lot more a lot more peace yeah and to basically unburden them of about 50,000 jobs that's exactly right and I think self-care has has gotten you know misrepresented it doesn't mean getting a manicure every week it could if that does it for you but when I think about self-care and I really think about the work we do with parents at good inside we always say good inside and like our app it's not parenting it's for parents it's for the Journey of what it means to be a parent it's for your own stuff it's for your triggers it's for finally learning how to set boundaries it's about finally learning that it's okay to get your needs met even when they inconvenience others it's learning that your Rel relationships are strong enough that they can get through hard moments where people are upset with you right it's about finally saying to if you need to your mother-in-law we can't have any visitors on Saturday and the reason I'm finally able to do that is because I understand my self value and all this stuff this has nothing to do with the fact that your kid isn't sleeping at night but that is the foundation for intervening in the way you're proud of when your kid is waking you up at 2 in the morning right so that is the self-care it's really like a not just self-care it's self- establishment it's self-growth really I don't know the psychology literature or clinical literature around this but I'm thinking about um speed of emotional shifts in my own experience of Life U I've known moody people um and I've known not as moody people I Define Moody as people that whose moods fluctuate quickly and sometimes spontaneously but this but this idea that um some people are like steady as a rock is a is a great concept but we also know that we need to feel our emotions Express them to some extent and yet there are people where uh if we were to plot this it would look like a high frequency wave where some people are really upset then they're feeling better again they're upset then they're feeling better again I'm not talking about extreme pathology here I'm talking about um you know someone cuts them off in traffic and they're pissed but then they're fine um they're very very happy about something they see so it doesn't always have to be negative but then they're kind of like flat AFF effect and then they're into you know something negative I think that experience of emotions is so far and away different from the experience of emotions um emitted from somebody who you can kind of see the emotion coming it's like a slow swell it's like a it's like a expansion and then a contraction again that you you have time and I feel like I keep coming back to this theme of time perception but anytime we have time or we hear about like in the all the Buddhist Traditions like space like you're trying to create mental space and you know this gap between stimulus and response it all sounds great but with some people you have to really be on your toes or perhaps you disengage and so I've never heard a satisfying answer to this probably because I've never asked it out loud if you're a kid or if you're a parent and somebody is experiencing something let's say they're really angry or really happy you can imagine riding that wave in with them you could also Imagine sitting back from it and some of this is probably what we call temperament but maybe you could talk about this a little bit um in the context of having one or both parents that's kind of a like a high frequency shifts between emotions versus kind of a slow expansion and and um and then settling of emotions because I feel like those are two completely different experiences of Life yeah I mean I think you're speaking to how differently we feel emotions I mean you know I think about one of my kids who I call a deeply feeling kid right so my image is always she's just more porous to the world and so if you think about someone who's more porous that their pores are literally wider a lot more is going to come in and guess what a lot more is going to come out right and she's a kid who by the way you're in a certain area in New York City she's like I can't be here the smell for me I'm wired differently I was like I literally don't smell anything different now does that mean she's wrong no I I actually bet knowing her she smells things and then she lets me know how awful it is and she can't stand on that corner and for me in that moment at least cuz we're probably all volatile in different ways I look steady as a rock right um I have another kid who yeah is pretty steady until he feels like his authority and power is threatened and then you better watch out you know and so in one moment someone might see him as oh wow that kid's really volatile but in probably 90% of other moments he's kind of cool as a cucumber so I also think it's important to categorize kids not as like always one way or another but we all feel emotions differently none of them is wrong or right to me the goal is to not be locked into any one thing that to me rigidity is always the enemy that that's what holds us back in adulthood if we're always one way I can never handle someone cutting me off in traffic because the emotion takes me over I have road rage yeah that's not good that's a very rigid limited way of living life but it's probably also limiting to say I've never really gotten riled up about anything forget road rage but it's kind of amazing to get riled up once in a while and to feel really passionately about something and to feel something enough that you want to go do something about it right so there's no morality on it I think what's tricky I can even say as a parent of three kids is each of my kids I always kind of imagine this if I have all these different parts of me they each need a different part of me to kind of lead like they almost need different lead parents right so my kid who is my deeply feeling kid I know what's so important is that I believe her experience and I better be ready with certain boundaries because she feels things so intensely especially when she was younger I have to step in more often there's more difficult Behavior right my kid who's really really steady I try to sometimes even though it's convenient CU he's so easy you know there's definitely a lot going on in there and sometimes I wonder does he almost feel like all the emotional space is taken up by his siblings and the only thing left for him is kind of steady as a rock and that can lead to a rigidity later in life right so I think these are like Moving Systems so much of how we experience emotions growing up is also dictated by the system and kind of the roles our siblings play um and so I don't know if that kind of gives you enough of an answer um but that's very that's informative yeah I think the thing I really want parents to know is I think we place a lot of morality on it and if we're honest with ourselves we're probably just comparing our kid to how we do things so if you're someone who's pretty steady you're like my kid is crazy they're dramatic right if you're someone who's a little more out there you're not as bothered by that kid and then you have another kid you're like that kid's kind of boring right because they're so flat and so I mean I think this is true in couples too whenever we're fighting we're probably just saying why can't you be more like me when we're triggered by our kid we're like why can't you be more like me right that's probably what are always saying to each other going back to communication but if you take a little different perspective of hold on a second there's no wrong or right way to feel emotions some behaviors are not allowed but all the emotions have information and what might my kid need right now instead of oh my goodness is my kid messed up or why is my kid not just a little bit more like me how useful is it to talk to kids about emotions when they're not happening I mean to me this is something like I I always just say I always phrase it as emotion talk right just knowing that emotions live within you knowing that there's names for them that they're normal that they make sense to me it's like the ultimate leg up in life it's like it gives your kids such resilience because we we can't beat our emotions I feel like we've been trying that for Generations like if I just only didn't feel so angry or so jealous are so sad our emotions are so Primal in our body and I I really do believe emotions they're information that's what they are why would we ever want to not get the information our body is giving us and sometimes it's almost dramatic what happens in an amazing way like so many people I think about so many times of people in a room for therapy they start crying I'm so sorry you're feeling something so intensely that your body is producing water from your your eyes to get your attention like that's that must be really important information why are we saying sorry and as far as we know a a uniquely uh human thing I could be wrong about this but a colleague in uh of mine at Stanford and psychiatrist um Carl daero talked about this um that humans are the only species that we are aware of that sheds tears for sake of emotion yeah other animals they have lacrimal glands they produce you know water so to speak salty water that comes out of their their eye region but uh not as it relates to emotions at least we don't think so so that's a great example like I even think about a conversation I have had with my kids and I like to just have these moments here and there whenever I talk about good conversations with my kids I think people think I have these 45 minute no they're they're usually 10 seconds I say one thing my kids say can I have a snack now and I think that's a great conversation because I know it gets in there do you know that tears have really important information for us be like what what did you say I'm just thinking so many people think tears are bad tears are kind of amazing it's like our body is trying to stop us and it's like asking us to pay attention to something really powerful I just think it's kind of an amazing thing our body does and my kid goes can I have pretzels oh sure I'll get you pretzels that that to me is a win I just want to tell everyone I love it that is a 10 out of 10 I'm bragging to people about that like I had the best conversation because I know this is seeping in mhm because in the moment my kid is crying you think it's going to be helpful when my seven-year-old is crying tears are amazing they're like f you Mom no one wants to hear that my reflex would be to tell them uh the biology of Tears Nome Soo who was on the podcast told us that tears contain hormones that signal to other people phermones excuse me that literally change the biology of the people around you we can actually smell tears we don't realize we're doing it see here I go so you tell I realize you tell a kid I spent enough time with with kids that if you you tell them that they're like whatever but you know when that's a great conversation around the dinner table and again your kids will roll their eyes that kids roll their eyes about everything I always think rolling their eyes or stop is kind of a kid's way of saying there's a lot coming at me on my own person I just need to push it away a little so that on my own time and under my own control I can take it in and we take ey rolls or whatever it is so personally that then we end up getting into a parish go why are you rolling my eyes and we miss this opportunity if we just say nothing then our kid is going to take in what we just said just walk away let the whole process happen you know it's kind of like if your boss comes in and says something like oh look that project really wasn't as good as it you know could have been and I really need these things done and you're like and then imagine you're rolling your eyes at me if your boss just leaves the room you probably think I didn't do that as well as I could I'm going to go work on it right so I feel like not taking the bait is a very important parenting tool but I think those moments with our kids to talk about emotions and to talk about our own especially when it comes to struggle right I one of the things I think a lot about I try to be intentional with my kids especially when they were younger I just think kids are flooded by their parents' capability and it is so hard to learn in environments where someone's capability is so far beyond your own like I'm not a good cook but if I was really learning to cook I I would want to learn from someone from here or there you know burned some garlic or messed up the broccoli and then was was like okay well I guess I could do this next time I'll be like okay but if I'm learning to cook from someone who is whatever celebrity chef I like that's that person's like way too far from me and I almost feel shame so I think about this with our kids and how this relates to emotions where when your kids are younger especially if you just think about the first 10 minutes of their day they're trying to figure out maybe how to brush their teeth how to go to the bathroom how to turn on the sink how to wash their hands they always put their shirt on the wrong way they can't get on their socks there's so many things and you come out dress perfectly and then they're like I can't get out my socks and you go like this okay one two and kind of in those moments I always think that's I'm just kind of saying to my kid I can do everything easily and they don't know our history they don't know we struggled to put on socks for 5 years too I put on my shirt backward you know until College they don't know that and so I think again in these calm moments you have this opportunity to say something like I cannot finish this crossw word puzzle or like I love New York Times games right and it's so fun with my kids now that they're older but my connections was really hard today I just I really struggled with it and I was like oh I can't do it I can't do it and then I took a deep breath and I tried it a little more and you know maybe I said and I did it or or I Didn't Do It Whatever it is and it gives my kid first of all gives my kid an opportunity to just notice that I struggle too it gives my kid again kind of an arc and a story of oh someone I admire so much every kid admires their parents they've had hard times they still have hard times they work through things they burn garlic they can kind of talk themselves through it um that is such a more powerful kind of lesson in Emotion regulation than teaching your kid kind of directly yeah it also seems that um we're here we're not defining the age of the kids but if one presents themselves as um perfect or close to it in any kind of relationship work romantic parenting Etc um sooner or later you're going to fall from grace because they're either going to be looking for the mistake or the moment you make a mistake it's going to be this fracture in the picture that people had of you and I have to say um and I think some people might get irritated or even um dare I say triggered uh by the language I'm about to use but I feel like the real like ninja move in all this is to acknowledge that there are power dynamics between parent and child but then to try and dissolve the power dynamics and I say this in the context of having run a lab for a long time which is very different than raising small children but you have people who are coming into your laboratory they are they if they're your graduate student or postto they're they're staking their whole career on your ability to teach and mentor and a lot is at stake Nothing is for for certain they might not get a job the papers might not work out that you know and so there's just so much tension around it and um and so as a pi as a principal investigator in a lab I I remember feeling that pressure of like it's got to work out and one of the best things that ever happened to me as a graduate student was that my first paper took forever to get accepted and we almost got in and then it didn't get in and then finally it got in such that every paper after that felt like a breeze because it took so damn long the first time and I got to see that my advisor couldn't like make magic happen and fortunate fortunately that's the way the scientific process is supposed to work and I think about this in in the context of parenting like if you if you're seen as Invincible you know we hear about this like people say I thought my dad was Superman I thought my mom was Superwoman you know and then but you can imagine what how disappointing it must be when they discover anything about a lack of capacity or or a break in emotional stability Etc so how does one present themselves as both um powerful in the positive sense of the word yeah such a such a thorny word but powerful in the positive sense of the word but human and vulnerable to making mistakes yeah in a way that you don't give up the essential let's just call it what it is a power Dynamic with your kids so that the kid then doesn't feel they have to parent you I love this topic because it's it's so interesting right now it's kind of review season at good inside because I also I'm the CEO of a company and to me the things I talk about with parenting and my kids and for other people parenting their kids they are the exact same principles exact as leading a team and so when I think about review season and the way we get feedback and the right and back and forth it it brings us all together and I'll explain so the other day I said to my kids I love resolutions I actually do love resolutions right because I love just the opportunity to say what is one small thing I'm like I value and I'm going to hold myself accountable to do what I said to my kids was I want you to come up with one thing just one thing for now and it has to be something like manageable and real that I could do that would really make me a better mom to you you asked your kids this I asked my kids this I actually asked my kids this relatively frequently it's like a review right um because it's something I do at work all the time and what I say at work is cuz often my d report like nothing I said I just want to tell you something I need one thing from you by the end of the day I need it because like I know I know I can get hot I know I can get a little reactive right um I know I'm always go go go and there probably is a moment that you know I need to pause I I I know I know I have a lot of issues so if you don't tell me one thing I don't trust you as much so here's what happened with my kids at that point it was only two of them it just happened the other day my son says my seven-year-old son sometimes when you're trying to get some work done at home and I want to get your attention for something this is what you do Mom one minute one minute one minute and then you still don't give me he's he's clock I'd rather you tell me 5 minutes and then give me your full attention that's literally I I I was just like that is a really good suggestion and I really needed to hear that I can do that this was a couple days ago okay I have to admit two days ago he was trying to show me something and he just goes you're doing it you're not really giving me your attention and I said you're right thank you change is hard I actually do need about 2 minutes is that okay and then you'll I'll put my computer down cuz I'll sometimes look at him and like kind of look you know and he goes okay it it was kind of it was so so beautiful my daughter said at night she goes it's so interesting when you give people this opportunity how generous they can be with you I think it's been true at working home my goes I know when it's my bedtime at night I always want to do one or two extra things I know I always have to get my water Mom it's just how I am that's what she said and you get this rushing voice and you go come on it's bedtime and that's like the last voice I hear before bed and I really don't like that voice and so can you just know that I always need to do those one or two extra things and not use that voice and again I said you know what I wouldn't want to hear that as the last voice you know and I think at night especially is a little digression one I always feel like I'm in a rush I don't I don't know extra two minutes with my kids like my kids are getting older they're not even in my house for that much longer I just have to remind myself I'm not in a rush like this is the best use of my time so I said and that one I've been really good at and so how do we show our kids that we're fallible one way is actually like asking for feedback especially when you have older kids when you have a teenager this is the number one thing that can change things around you know what I'm thinking about it's hard to be a teen and I'm definitely not a perfect parent of a teen I'm sure you have a long list but for right now can you name one thing that I could do that would make me a better parent to you and I want to follow this through cuz what a lot of teens will do or parents will say my teenager tells me something ridiculous they'll say well you know how you make me charge my phone at 900 or 10:00 p.m. out of the room you could let me sleep with my phone which maybe parent like I'm just not going to do that or they'll say you know what you could do you could give me $1,000 every week for an allowance right and so parents will say my kid doesn't take it seriously this is where like to me one of the most important life skills parenting management friendships it doesn't matter is differentiating someone's words on the surface from their needs or their feelings or their fears whatever it is underneath and not responding to the words but kind of cutting under them let's even same I could said the phone thing what would be so great about having your phone just help me understand it I know in my head I'm never going to do it but we don't realize just cuz we're not going to do something someone asks it doesn't mean we don't owe that person the right to try to understand why they want it right so I might just ask questions it might probably end with look I actually hear what you're saying all of your friends are on Instagram until midnight it sounds like you legitimately do miss out on conversations by the time you get to school you feel out of them like I'm not even joking I feel like if I was your age i' feel like that's like basically the worst thing ever I believe you having your phone after X time is just one of my non-negotiables it's actually just cuz I love you so much that I feel like my job is to protect you I wonder if there is some other way that we can figure that out or my kid says $1,000 I might say what would you do with $1,000 oh you go oh you want to go to more concerts oh your friends all get more allowance tell me more no matter what your kid says to you there's information so I think feedback is one I think repair is another way repair is the most important relationship strategy to get good at and I just hope everyone hears the duality in that and realizes what that means because if you're going to get good at repair you have to mess up the only way to repair is to mess up and so if I'm telling you get good at repair I am telling you you have to accomplish step one which is yelling at your kid you have to and you're going to do it anyway I do it but if you then tell yourself wait I'm getting good at repair Step One is messing up I crushed it amazing I'm half the way there then when you repair which is when you take ownership I'm sorry I yelled just like you I'm managing my emotions emotions are really tricky emotions are really hard and do you know what even though you're going to have a leg up on this compared to most people when they're adults cuz you're learning how to regulate emotions you're still going to be practicing that when you're my age that is my responsibility to work on it's not your fault and I love you so powerful I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrient nutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only January 2025 ag1 is giving away 10 free travel

medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing improvements in acne meaning reductions in acne reduce pain and inflammation improved mitochondrial function and even improving visual function itself what sets Tu lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in specific combinations to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations personally I use the ju whole body panel about three to four times per week typically in the morning but sometimes in the afternoon and I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try ju you can go to juv spell jv.com huberman Ju is offering an exclusive discount to all hubman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's juv jv.com huberman to get up to $400 off I love love love this thing about asking for a request it's different than asking for feedback which could quickly lead to a list of all the things that you one does wrong as opposed to a request for how one could do better yeah so I think there's an important distinction there and then it seems that the question that uh the parent or who knows the boss or whatever maybe it's with a romantic partner needs to ask themselves is you what is this request really about yeah like what's underneath it I'm just paraphrasing essentially what you said and what's it really about is it a request for more autonomy for more social connection with other people and then one starts to realize it certainly in this um example that you gave of uh a child asking for more time with their phone later at night is that it actually has nothing to do with your relationship to them it's really about their relationship to their friends yeah could be and the fact that they might feel as if they're missing out yeah and um that leads me to another question which is what if you as the parent partner boss Etc keep your phone close to you until mid midnight and they know that yeah so one of the worst things that I believe anyone can say is you know do as I say not as I do it's just it's just such an a like blatantly arrogant stance of you're supposed to do what I say because I say so but I'm not going to do it because I don't want to um and yet there are times like in parent child relationships or boss employee relationships where you're telling somebody to do something and you yourself are not going to do it or no longer do it or choose not to do it and in reality you don't have to and maybe there's a good reason why you don't or don't have to that's the nature of that's why I use these uh words um power dynamics which which everyone hears and goes oh boy here we go but but it is an issue of power dynamics you have more power than than the kid so what you're doing is you're giving the kid power to express where they want more agency I like the word maybe agency more than power yeah um did you grant your son the uh the right to use his phone later into the evening my son my son not to pry into your personal my son did not ask me that and he knows that our phone rules are non-negotiable I didn't mean to pry into your into your family Dynamics but that if that's a rule you would never give it to them but I think so many times and then we'll get back to Power we shouldn't be afraid to learn more I I I actually just think that's what it is our kid says all my friends get this that's not true why don't you just learn more oh they do tell it's like learning more about what someone says doesn't mean you ever have to change your boundary most of conflict is about a lack of understanding anyway when you learn more you're trying to understand understand your kid understand you're someone wants a raise and you think it's ridiculous you can learn more tell tell tell me what's been going on what have you been doing like learning more about someone's position does not weaken your position and I think that's really really important in any form of leadership now in terms of the power dynamics there is something about the word power that like you know is that weird yeah I mean I think the way I think about it and what we do at good Insight a lot in terms of our leadership and parenting style I don't use the word power but think it's about embodying your Authority parents have authority Pilots have authority bosses have authority because they're the ones kind of who have the job of setting up the whole system for success that's their job right my job isn't to make my kid happy my job is to help create the conditions for my kid to be like a real functioning confident buil that's what I believe right a pilot job is definitely not to keep passengers happy it's to get everyone safely on the ground a boss's job is not to keep everyone happy is to set up the conditions for health and success of the business right now if you know that's your job it's no one else's job but the CEO I mean to some degree all the management but that is their job and so there's a difference where if the CEO believes a job needs to be done a certain way it's not that they have power it's just their role involves having that Authority and if someone else disagrees it's up to them to say you can keep the job or not it's just a diff have different roles so and I actually think owning that very outright it's actually something I recently said at work in a review around something I really wanted and kind of owned like in my role as a CEO like that is under my role to decide this is important and now we have to figure it out let's see I would love some input on how we're going to get this done same thing for a kid one of the lines I said over and over and over to my kid when they younger and I see so many good inside parents tell me that their kids reflect back to them later is my number one job is to keep you safe so what does that mean that kind of relates to power it can mean why am I not letting my kid I don't know jump up and down on our kitchen counter it's not cuz I'm pissed that my kid isn't listening I'm not letting them jump up and down on my kitchen counter where there's a light above their head because my number one job is to keep my kid safe is that power I mean I guess I think it's Authority how would I embody that Authority I would say it looks hard for you to get down I'm about to pick you up and put you on the floor because I have authority right we get to this phone discussion let's say and I really do believe that the phone has to be charged out of the room at a certain time I'm going to understand I'm going to understand I'm going to listen hopefully I'm connected to my kid and they feel respected by Me In A Million Ways and it might lead to me saying look my number one job still is to keep you safe and that really means making decisions that I really believe are good for you shortterm and long term even if you're upset with me this is one of those times and so I love you this might be a point of conflict I know we're going to get through this and that is my role as a parent and it comes from a place of wanting to protect you and and I think when you embody your Authority in that way kids never say thank you and they will roll their eyes and kids always feel loved and protected Ed they really do I hear it from my kids you know and maybe this this is so true sometimes things happen with my kids and I'm like no one's going to even believe this but I was walking with my seven-year-old the other day and I said what does it mean to be a good parent what does it really mean I'm curious really thought he goes means you're kind of strict and I said what do you me strict CU you have certain rules that you think matter and he goes but it also means like you also have to be loving and fun my heart like hurts hearing like myself say this like in a good way hurting like they know I think kids know and maybe he says that because that's what we are but I think kids know and I can't even tell you how many kids I used to work with and teens especially the pain of their P of their parents not embodying their Authority was so clear they knew that they shouldn't be out at a certain time they knew that they were hanging out with kids who were like bad news and their parents had no idea and they felt unanchored like they really really knew not that their parents weren't exerting power that word isn't their parents weren't embodying their appropriate authority to protect their kids I had something come to mind which is not a a phrase that I've ever used before or heard before um but what comes to mind is kind of um statements of stance yes I feel like statements of stance in parent child relationships families workplace romantic relationships Etc are great when they're about actions or about sort of overriding themes like no matter what I'm trying to keep you safe I might not get everything right but like that is like non-negotiable internally and I'm going to try and make it non-negotiable externally like it's a statement that stands about actions like um or you know keeping you healthy and safe is my number one priority th those are facts those are things that one can really say and believe and and you know until the end of time be trying to uh incorporate into one's Behavior but I feel like statements of stance about emotions are very dangerous like um we don't yell in this house um you know uh it's okay to cry right there's always a caveat of course it's okay to cry right um but there are times when crying is less appropriate there's times when um yelling might be appropriate uh there's times when um emotions need to be expressed or not expressed in a particular way because I look I don't think I'm alone in thinking that you know the kid tantruming in the um in a public environment is an embarrassing thing for them for their parent for people around and it's not the end of the world right it's a tantrum for goodness sake right like uh people will survive but I feel like statements of stance about emotions kind of hold us to this standard that we'll never be able to meet but that statements of stance about action are you know until we fail and you know hope we don't yeah um we can say things like you know my job is always to keep you safe I'm always going to try and make the best decision for you and for your sister right for instance but I think that many people I'm not just speaking from my own experience but in talking to friends and um and others that they grew up in homes where like there were these philosophies these like statements of stance and the moment that things didn't match that statement of stance like the whole concept of what parents and children are supposed to be about just kind of started to dissolve and it creates that underlying fear like do they even really know what they're doing yeah or maybe they don't know what they're doing but maybe they're trying so in any case it's um it's just something that maybe we could um yeah talk about for a moment I have some reaction to that I think I mean I kind of think you're talking about values and principles right and so I think there are in my house to be honest it's not like we have some wall of like these are our family values that's I mean some SE yeah that's not on the refrigerator not organized enough to to do that but if I thought about a couple that come to mind like my job is to keep my kids safe by the way safe does not mean they're never in a situation without risk that's not what I mean um you know but in general that's his own form of danger exactly the minimization of risk is also not safe right so but my job is to keep you safe I'm not going to let you do things that you know endanger yourself for others so that's one another principle I think about is um I will always tell you the truth even if it's uncomfortable like you can always count on me for that we call that kind of I call that truth over Comfort right so if my kid says to me how are babies made that that value is useful right um another thing is like all feelings are allowed not all behaviors are okay right stuff like that what about we we don't swear in this house so what I was about to say and then you're on the phone and then you scre up and then the kid goes you swear to me what's very different is these kind of rigidities around Behavior we don't swear swearing is a behavior we don't cry in public Behavior we don't tantrum here that's a behavior behaviors all the time are a manifestation of feelings that overpower skills so saying we don't do certain behaviors it to me it it doesn't even make l I sense well what if I'm in a situation where I have a really intense emotion and don't have the skill to manage it we don't that's the behavior is going to happen and then I feel like a bad person they're very that's very different than values around intention I want to be truthful with my kids even if things are uncomfortable I might fumble around with the words right I might even sometimes lie because I didn't do that value in action but what I can come back to is okay nobody lives their values 100% of the time so I think we're talking about actually something core to what we think about a good inside which is I'm a good person with values who is totally imperfect and sometimes acts in ways I'm not proud of both are true when families have values that are very behavior-based what ends up happening in the kids is they start to equate certain behaviors with morality these are good behaviors that make me loved in my family and these are bad behaviors that kind of make me feel like I'm not the right part of my family and they even make me wonder like am I lovable am I good inside after all right am I worthy that that's not good because whenever we tie Behavior to Identity that's shame and we've tried to motivate kids with shame for for hundreds and hundreds of years and it and it and it does not work and causes a lot of problems I think another one which is interesting especially as my kids get older I said this to my teen recently this is really tricky one of my jobs as always has been to create guidelines and rules with you you know it's always going to be kind of collaborative some because of my authority will be directive that I believe are going to keep you safe and I think this really relates to a phone I want to tell you another part of my job that might sound contradictory but I actually think we just need to hold them both at once another part of my job is to be there for you when you inevitably go against those guidelines and I want you to know that we have rules around what can and cannot be done online and I'll say serly and like if you do kind of become part of a really inappropriate text conversation if there is bullying if you do come across some images online that make you feel really uncomfortable and you're like I shouldn't have seen that like you're not getting in trouble with me I'm not going to throw you a party like I I will be there for you to help you through those moments those things sound contradictory and in our family we know two things can be true and those are both true right to me that that's really important thing for a teenager to know let's talk about guilt and shame yes I've heard some kind of catch phrasy stuff not from you but like oh you know guilt is about the thing you did and shame is a feeling about who we are and you know I while I'm not against those sort of um 1990s early 2000s kind of psychology isms I feel like they're not very useful in the same way that hearing that there's a gap between stimulus and response and if you identify that Gap well then goodness you're going to be the kind of person that can feel feel stressed but not be reactive you're going to be responsive not reactive that's just a bunch of words that doesn't here I'm a biologist so I'll just say doesn't take into account the fact that the biology of stress changes your perception of time and a whole bunch of other things that basically make that gap between stimulus and response much much smaller and I think once people understand that they go oh so like the the kitchen refrigerator magnet or the poster on the wall that says you know like there's a gap between stimulus and response it was supposed to save me but it didn't of course not like we're just in different states of mind at different times so how do you define no pressure here but um but how do you define guilt versus shame right and what about guilt and shame great two of my favorite topics I have a couple different ways of defining things I I I I'm like you to me I I like defining things in ways that are very concrete and very usable that's all and if there's multiple ways of doing that that's great so the way I think about guilt this will probably set us off in a direction about what is not guilt also is guilt is a feeling I have when I act out of alignment with my values and in that way guilt is a really useful feeling real useful because it makes me reflect on wait I didn't act in line with my values I wonder why what would I have had to do differently what got in my way wow I'm so glad I have that information from my body to have this deeply uncomfortable feeling to set in that process right so if I yell at my kid I'm going to feel guilty right I I I think about a time when my kid told me you know I lied to you I did take that eraser from that kid in school and I feel really guilty and I said first all I'm so glad you told me that I'm I'm so glad you're feeling guilty that's the right way to feel now there must have been something so hard about seeing something so shiny and fun that you don't have I totally get that and you're right that's not in your values to take it so that's a useful feeling that feeling is going to help you not do something like that again let's figure out what you can do not just to say sorry this is what parents miss you know what's going to happen another time you're going to see something else pretty cool someone's cubby and you know what most people think I'm going to take that you're going to have the thought again I would too what can you do the next time you have that thought right all of this comes because of guilt useful feeling guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values now Tam meil is one of the most misunderstood feelings because what you hear all the time and you'll hear how much it kind of conflicts with this definition is something like this I haven't seen my friends in years there's finally a dinner but it would require me not to put my kid down to sleep you know and I'm talking to someone I'd say okay well I'm guessing you're not leaving your kid alone yeah my husband or my mom someone who's a totally safe adult but Becky I told my kid and she was clinging to me like no Mommy I needed to be you I need to be you and so I'm not going to dinner do you know what I'm going to say Andrew because I feel so guilty this is right oh someone asked me to be in the PTA meeting and I'm so busy I can't but I can't do it because I feel so guilty okay again I'm just curious is like well it sounds like you really want to go to dinner with your friends she like oh I do all I do as parent these days I literally haven't seen these friends in years they're in town and he said tell me about your friendships that's me you do I value my yes I know that I'm kind of more than just someone who puts down my kid for bed and I love doing that but but this matters too so I said this is really interesting you really value your friendships your life right now feels out of balance and that your friendships that part of your burner of your stove is like really low okay okay and you're not going because you feel guilty I just want to share an idea guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values it seems like going to dinner would be in line with your values and almost it's like yeah that's true so what is this feeling and here's what I think the feeling is I call it not guilt just because I haven't figured out a more sophisticated term but here's what I think is happening a lot of us especially women when we were growing up we learned to notice every everyone's feelings around us and we learned that our value really and our worth really and we were kind of best and good girls when we took care of everyone else's feelings except for our own I think so many young girls especially become expert at what people need of them by becoming distant from what they need for themselves the picture I get in my mind is sort of like having anteni cast in every direction that's right except perhaps at the exclusion of of paying attention to theeni that are inward exactly and we're and we are um you know attentional resources are finite I mean we we just don't have the capacity to right like respond to other people's emotions and feel at the same time to the same degree that we would if we just concentrated on theirs or our emotions that's just a fact of how humans work yeah and kids are are oriented by attachment they have to learn with their families how do I become the most lovable safest version of myself so I have a friend who it's true I remember her even in middle school I can't come my dad's traveling and my mom really needs me to stay home and watch a movie with her right and I I know this mom well it's like oh you don't love me you don't right I mean this was so she became expert at always noticing other people's emotions and not only noticing them taking the emotions from them kind of like taking them into their body and almost metabolizing them for them that's not guilt that is taking someone else's emotions and taking them into your body at the expense of taking care of your own needs and so I have a visual for this because I think it's really powerful where let's say it's the situation where a mom is saying I really want to go out to dinner but I feel so guilty first thing is just powerful to say that is not guilt it is something else and it is real and it is powerful but it is not guilt what is happening I'm on one side of a tennis court like me and you Andrew but let's say it's a tennis court and you're on the other side or even This and like in between instead of Anette it's like a glass table over here I am here in my desire to go out with my friends because I do value my friendships okay over there is you're upset about it and let's say instead you're my daughter like no no don't go no one else can put me to bed that is definitely hard to deal with but that is your daughter's feelings those are not your feelings those are your daughter's feelings and some of us SL a lot of us have developed this tendency where we're on this court and all of a sudden all those feelings from your side somehow go through that wall and they come to your side and you call it guilt it is not guilt and to me one of the most liberating things and this actually relates to empathy as I always say is to give that feeling back to its rightful owner because what that means is if I really give it back now I have a boundary that's my kids's feeling that's not mine and I can now actually empathize people said no I was empathizing I wasn't going out no no no no that's not empathy you weren't going out with your friends because you couldn't handle the distress in your body you just made your Fe daughter's feelings your own you just engaged in someone something almost selfish this has nothing to do with your daughter in those situations that's why we say weird things to our four-year-old like don't you want Mommy to have friends I feel like Four's like why are you asking me that question it's like a pilot being like don't you want me to make an emergency landing like if you need to make an emergency landing don't ask me for permission because once I give it back to my daughter I can do this I can say you really wish I would put you to bed tonight you're right it feels so different when Grandma does it oh it does I'm going out it's okay if you're upset I'll be back and I'll kiss you and I'll see you in the morning and then this next part is so important when you walk out I don't want any person having any illusion that the daughter is going to be like yes you go girl no she is going to scream that's okay going back to the boundary you're allowed to take care of your needs and other people are allowed to be inconvenienced and upset by it it doesn't mean your needs are wrong it doesn't mean their feelings are wrong and it definitely doesn't mean you feel guilty I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need but nothing you don't that means the electrolytes

um I think the lens that you're looking at guilt through and the way you're defining it is so very different than the way it's been discussed ever and I think this is a super super important topic um so I'd like to lathe into it a little bit more in some ways the way that I think many people experience guilt at least according to your definition which um by the way I love um it's when we've act out of alignment with our values um versus feeling pressure like I think about I mean Lord knows I don't have the best reputation as getting uh having a short text uh response latency um it's variable sometimes I'm quick on the draw and other times I'm like oh goodness it'll be days or weeks I mean over the holidays I was spooling through it I would respond to people like a week later and um you know I do my best but but I do often feel um quote unquote guilty about not being as responsive in text to a number of people because I care about them yeah I value them yeah um but I get overwhelmed by text messaging very easily to the point where I have to put my phones out of the room when I work etc so the way I experience a bunch of text messages coming in is as pressure yeah that then I feel guilty I'm not trying to make this about me but no I want to let's go into this I have a lot to say I feel quote unquote guilty but do I really feel but what's interesting is you know I believe in cognitive dissonance and then what I notice is that then my brain tries to bridge that Gap I come up with these like justifications with like well when I text people and they don't respond for like two weeks I don't get upset which is true unless it's in a particular sort of right category of circumstances so how come the way they view this whole dynamic is not the same as the way I view this Dynamic okay maybe this is a more male Centric view as opposed to feeling porous like I feel their they upset but I will say you know In fairness to um all the chromosomes and their Arrangements I do feel bad yeah like it sucks I love these people and they're reaching out to say whatever happy New Year or something and I'm feeling pressure as opposed to feeling yeah how wonderful it is to have people in my life so here here here this is such a beautiful example where I I'd ask myself or I'd ask you to ask yourself okay I already you already named one of your values which is interesting I really value my relationships you said that okay that's one value and I think this is I'm G to ask you this question do you value quick responses all the time from you on text message is that a value of yours from me or to me from you do I value always responding to people on text right away the truth is if I'm really honest yeah I hate um shallow exchange of any kind except maybe a fist bump to somebody you just kind of feel some kinship with on the street and you have that connect and you just give them the fist bump great but I like more in-depth lengthy connection like three-h hour long conversation three hour long conversations or drop a friend came by the other day for um New Year's he was on my list of people that and yes I made a list of people that I want to deep in my friendship with in the in the New Year came by we had a 2hour lunch we chatted and and I feel like it was awesome and worth a million single line text messages and I'm also the kind of person where like I'm good to not see him for a while not because I'm tired of him but because I also have other friends and things to do right so I'm more of a depth not breadth kind of guy this is to me this is such a powerful process and then after this I kind of want to link it back to how I've actually told my kids about why I do go out to dinner with friends right so you're like I value deep relationships I value relationships I value deep relationship but and with I'm if I'm honest with myself responding to someone right away that's actually not my value but again we can hold multiple things at once that doesn't mean I don't care about those people I just laid out all my values what I think is so powerful as a not guilt diffuser is naming this directly to the people so doesn't have to be on text but you're see person X and you know I'm never that good I just want to tell you I I really value our friendship I really value these times we have together something I just also want to get off my chest is going back and forth quickly on text that's not something that's easy for me that I do very often and so you might text me and it might take me a while and I I just wanted to name that to you right now look someone else always has the right to say well that's interesting that doesn't work for me one of my top values with friends is someone who's always getting back and forth to me that's actually great great now we know okay what are we going to do about that that's fine you know where someone stands and the reason I relate this to the situation with going to dinner is I remember early on when my daughter said why do you have to go to dinner with friends or why do you and Dad this was it why do you and Dad go to dinner without us I know the couple you're going out with you both have kids why can't you bring us right and this is where we say we feel guilt but we don't cuz I'm like time out she's feeling this feeling not me and also I don't need her permission or approval that's the real parentified thing we like go to our seven-year-old and we're like don't you want me to have adult conversations again not it's not an atypical response I've heard parents do that like don't you want me to have a social life but you know what it is it is asking your kid to do your job for you again can you imagine a pilot say do you think we should make it an emergency landing it you'd be that's how a kid feels when they're asked that they're like why are you asking me that here's what I said to my daughter in that situation I really did I want to tell you something I love being your mom I I really do it's one of the most important things in my life I also really like being married to dad and I really like the times we have when it's just us and other adults that's really important I remember saying this maybe I was really trying to Double Down we actually we we had that before you guys were here you like what yeah um and so one of the reasons I want to be honest with you why do we go to dinner without you it's not so much we go to dinner without you we think of it as going to dinner with each other and just adults is that something we really enjoy it's really important to us it's a really important part of us and that's why like being really vocal about your values as opposed to looking to your child unconsciously to give you permission to have those values if you want to use power that's a power that's a power move and it's amazing this is true in any time in life the more you can locate someone the more you respect their boundaries I I use that word a lot and know like locate I'm sure you know people in your life like can I locate them you kind of know who they are you know what they value and you respect them right when you can't locate someone you feel very uneasy around them you're kind of like where are you who are you what do you stand for and as you can see with my daughter it was a I wasn't saying something mean I I was saying something true and so I think with the friendships and when you say is this guilty it's like well maybe my step and my action is just actually being honest with this person I'm not very good at responding right away I want to let you know I deeply care about our friendship I'm not very good at responding to kind of small talk over text and I just wanted to let you know that so you didn't misinterpret it like I I wonder what would happen I wonder if people would kind of respond really positively I love it and I I can't help but recall when I was a kid um after dinner my dad would sometimes take a walk by himself now granted he's a physicist and he was he's a theoretical physicist so he's like all his experiments were in his head and he did work on paper too but um so he would take these walks and occasionally I'd see him coming back from these walk and um he'd be smoking a cigar something he doesn't do anymore unfortunately um I'm grateful that he's very real boss he was actually a guest on the podcast recently talked about science and um life Etc and one of the things that I remember thinking and still to this day think and feel is it's kind of awesome how he takes this walk and he looked like so happy with the cigar and his thoughts and he' walked and I wanted to be on those walks with him he was very very busy in fact I wanted a lot more time from him than I got it's kind of interesting cuz now it's often times that I'm the busier one um the table's turn kids um but in all seriousness I didn't think of it as self-care but it was so clear that that was his time yeah that was absolutely his time and I knew when I could and should join for things and when I didn't and so when you say the more you can locate someone the more you respect their values I feel like Bells go off it's like exactly that and there are other examples of my mom Etc but it's kind of interesting when we see somebody adult or child like really in their element of their thing yes it's almost like we love them for it and through it and and it fills us I think in with a with a healthy sense of of safety like they're right there kind of like the pilot flying the plane really well like actually we don't really want to know about the pilot I want to hear the thing at the beginning where about take off I actually don't like it when we're landing and they say we'll be on the ground in just a few moments I'm like we're at 10,000 ft can we make it a little bit longer than that but you get the point which is that I don't want to hear from the pilot I just want the pilot to fly the plane you want the pilot to do their job and again in these you know I think I have so many pilot metaphors around sturdy leadership and I think it really is such a metaphor for how we teach people the skills they need to parent because again no one becomes a pilot overnight it's no one becomes a CEO overnight no one becomes a lawyer overnight or a professional basketball player you know I think we actually lawed CEOs these days who say I don't know how to do leadership as well as I'd want to I'm getting executive coach you all want to work for that person right the amazing athletes in the world get amazing coaches and they go to amazing training camps because they're amazing right and so I just somehow with parenting it's like the last area where people think I should become an amazing parent overnight I shouldn't have to invest in skills or education even people who invest in skills and education for every other area of their life that they probably care about less there's so much shame we've internalize that we should be able to do it naturally and you do become a parent overnight you become a parent over you do I'll remember my graduate adviser had two kids while I was uh working in the lab saying that there were all these books back then about pregnancy and she was like it's wild there are all these things of what you should eat and shouldn't eat and how you should you and your partner and how you should prepare for the birth and all this and then they like and then at the hospital they're like here and you're like uh now granted that was in you know the early 2000 that's still what it is and they're like what do you need and they go you need a car seat to leave the hospital which by the way you definitely need that that's all like just a car seat like how am I supposed to manage this because the thing I want parents to know because again there's just so much shame and maybe we should talk about shame right is um the only thing that comes naturally when it comes to Parenting is how you were parented that comes naturally that lives in your bones that lives in your circuits and and there might be some people who say amazing I have the greatest privilege in the world then what will come naturally is exactly what I value and what I want to do I would say more often people would say some version of definitely not what I want to do or parts I'll take Parts I want to do differently and to me it's kind of like if you were brought up speaking English and you really want to speak Mandarin or you want to speak Mandarin half the time to your kid and someone said are you going to learn Mandarin na naturally I feel like someone say how how does one learn Mandarin naturally you would I don't know you'd probably sign up for you know do a lingo you'd find an app or something or a course and you'd then practice and practice and you'd be able to make progress because you actually learn something new and so I just think big picture like parents are they're so underere equipped and set up to feel and this is I think has to do with shame that when my kids are struggling or when I'm yelling a lot it means something is wrong with me or something is wrong with my kid I feel like these days in almost every area if a CEO is saying I feel like I'm struggling is it my fault or my employees fault they probably say I don't know who there's probably people around who can help me who can teach me why why do I keep yelling right and same thing with almost every other field and to me more than like if there's any Legacy I get to leave in this world it's not even the approach itself even though I think our approach to Parenting is very different um I I just want parents to know like there is no shame in investing in learning and growing um in parenting and to look at that like they probably look at every other area of their life I assure you that your legacy extends uh far beyond that but includes it as well you've had a tremendous impact and continue to I mean it wasn't long ago that um you know the power dynamics of parent child relationships were you know you do what I say and I'm the parent you're the kid and like that kind of thing and I grew up in a different era I'm 49 now and I've been wanting to I'm 49 now so that I can actually say something with with having had some experience when things were truly very different they were just so different yeah was like you took what you got and you worked with it and you know things are so different thanks to um your part um in all of this and one thing I I do want to return to because I realize I took us off um off track with it is this idea of um kids but perhaps adults as well feeling or thinking they feel someone else's feelings taking that on yeah this difference between uh real guilt and gosh it's really hard to come up with a word for it I at one moment I thought well maybe it's faog guilt but no you're not pretending you're actually feeling something um which feels like guilt smells like guilt tastes like guilt someone said codependence I I I don't know that much about that word but something like that what's a um yeah it's a it's a whole landscape exactly it's a whole landscape but you know one practice that I'm familiar with um that I know exists in a a couple of different Realms of let's call it modern psychology uh tools is this idea of um creating a frame separation so like after you come together with somebody say to like do therapy um or something or you've had sort of an emotional um bind or entanglement doesn't have to be negative um that one way that you can uh learn over time to differentiate their needs and wants from your needs and wants is this idea of in your head I know it sounds kind of corny but there's a neuroscientific basis for this at least to my of in your head you say for like if we had just done this like we had some resonance around something maybe an argument okay like Dr Becky and I got into a fight that in order to really be able to move away from that and and see it clearly how much of that was yours how much of that was mine there's this idea that you you tell yourself okay what are five ways in which you and I are clearly distinct entities so you say and I know this folks might chuckle at this but you say like okay I'm a man you're a woman I live in California you Dr Becky lives in New York mhm um you could even make it like first person you say like or third person rather you could say I Andrew hberman I'm wearing you know a black shirt and a black um overshirt and Dr Becky is wearing black and white okay so some people might think like what's the use of that but to me as a neuroscientist whoever came up with that and it wasn't me is nothing short of brilliant because the brain organizes emotions in these broader schemas of physical objects and physical distance and distance in time and that's the way that we can differentiate between ourselves and everything around us and there's a whole discussion to be had about this but so it's something that um I've been playing with a little bit um because I don't claim to be this Ultra empath um or anything but I think uh it's um clear that sometimes we take in our thoughts and feelings about what other people are feeling sometimes accurate sometimes not and it can become very difficult whether or not someone's a one of these um I guess you call it deeply feeling deeply feeling deeply feeling kids um or not I mean anytime you get into an emotional resonance good or bad yeah I think it's uh we're porous we're porous and that's part of what makes humans so beautiful but yeah I found that practice to be very useful even if it's just in my own head like they're over there and I'm over here but not even necessarily pushing off them but thinking like oh like I'm me and you're you and there are a bunch of ways in which we differ in time and space and you and I I think the nervous system comes to understand that as a felt thing as opposed to just a statement like hey like you own your emotions all own mine that's just a statement um is this any of this I've never heard of that but I love that and and it it is in parallel I think with so many of the things I teach parents so even the idea of locating someone to me like my version of people in my life that I know and love even if I don't agree with anything they say that I can locate they're like an egg with a a shell they have a shell there's like a there's a boundary we're really talking about boundaries we all have different levels of porousness to the external world and I think if you know and there's there's pros and cons of both like I really mean this I am not terribly porous to other people's experiences I really have solid boundaries there are definitely moments in my closest relationships because what people will say to me okay like I know these are my feelings and not yours like we're in a close relationship like can you be here a little bit more with me and that is true like that is what I want to do right and sometimes it can be a little distancing right and a little separate people on the other end of that Spectrum if they know I'm very porous I tend to to me one of the ways of also thinking about it I think i gaze in before i gaze out and I think a lot of people gaze out before they gaze in right they spend a lot of time in other people's brains and less time in their own right what do they think of me what do they think right um if that's what's going on for you then the shell to your egg isn't always intact and so there's a spill over it's like whose feelings are whose's whose thoughts are who's I'm spending so much time worried about what that person thinks of me I almost like what am I what do I what do I think right and so the exercise you're naming is actually just a resetting of a boundary right is and things that are absurdly concrete are necessary for the most Primal parts of our brain to actually understand my name is Becky Kennedy to me what I say I don't usually say that I'll say my feet are on the ground when I do a grounding exercise everyone in our community knows this I my hand is always on my heart I think there's some amount of having contact with your body my hand is on my heart sometimes I used to do this with clients especially after an emotional experience going like this name five things in the room is probably another way there's a red clock I'm wearing a white shirt they're very very very basic as a way of kind of coming back into your body two mantras that I find help parents a lot actually make me think about this exercise one is I am the pilot not the turbulence in our kids turbulent moments when they are that turbulence what so easily happens is we merge into that with them and then it's no wonder our kids can't calm down our episodes last forever cuz we're just turbulence and turbulence together right so I'm the pilot not the turbulence also one day I'm going to do a partnership with some some airplane company because I feel like airplanes are just so beautiful because the the pilot gets a cockpit they get a boundary like it's right that's what parents need so that's one and the other one when your kids are upset or after there's an argument some people get very disregulated just knowing someone's upset with them right which is again kind of whose feelings are whose I find one of the most effective mantras and again these sound cheesy it's just I'm safe this isn't an emergency I can cope with this because our body if you tend to be porous you get activated just by other people being activated even though it wasn't your feeling in the first place and your body actually needs the reminder that you're safe to not kind of add add to that turbulence I love it can we talk about projection for a second one of the things that drives me insane people close to me know this because of this issue of porousness versus non-porous is when people tell me how I feel and so I've talked to a few very qualified psychiatrists about this and it's called projection like you sometimes it's if in Anger it's aacu ative projection like you think I'm crazy someone will say like you think I'm crazy or um you're upset with me or something like that I feel like projection is um one of the kind of um litmus tests of how porous we are because in theory somebody should be able to tell us that we feel whatever and if we first look inside and by the way I love this concept of do you first look inside or outside do you listen to what's inside or outside first when something kind of AR Rises and emotionally outs emotionally outside you love love love that it's a something I'll have to explore um but if we don't do that then you could see how projection would be very effective and I'm not accusing anyone of using this in any kind of diabolical way I think people just do it because it worked and they're doing it because they've always done it but if somebody says you know like like you don't care about me as a friend or you know telling someone how they feel is so very different than telling someone how we feel duh right it's kind of obvious and yet once you start watching for projection you see it all the time yeah not just at you but like in between people right like you know like I know this stresses you out but you know people start doing it all the time it's very interesting to see how people kind of divide into a couple different groups on this maybe two or more groups in terms of whether or not it affects them and if it gets in their head or somehow they're like no it's ridiculous I don't I don't feel that way and for me it's very context specific but i' love your thoughts on um projection both towards kids and from kids so all right I'm going to I'm going to respond to that and you just cut me off if you're like Becky that's not the direction I want you to go in because I guess MGI which is I call most generous interpretation is to me the like embodiment of not what I do all the time definitely not because I'm imperfect but what I think is just a useful framework to try to employ as much as possible because the idea of what is the most generous interpretation of someone's Behavior like projection counteracts are very natural human tendency which is just what is the least generous interpretation right we all come up with the least generous interpretation of people's behavior all the time and it's just quick it's easy and I think it's CU in our brain if we see something bad or annoying it's just easy to think that that's the whole right so I can't even tell you how many times every parent I know will say my kid doesn't listen they hit all the elevator buttons they hit other people and and then I said and I know what you're thinking they're a sociopath they're like that's literally what I'm thinking I was like I know I have that thought too well no when I was a kid I used to push every button in the elevator right does that mean I'm a sociopath no it means you are a good kid who has not yet learned the skills to regulate urges that's all it means that would be the most generous in you just want no I'm kidding you just want to push them I'm joking I'm joking I have a kid like that too he wants things for himself and he derives a lot of Joy from things those types of kids are going to do things okay that's my resilient Rebel um okay but projection why am I bringing that up so what's my most generous interpretation of why this projection would happen why would a kid say you're mad at me or you know I can see how mad you are at me or why would someone even say in adulthood um you seem really really stressed out right again the gazing in versus gazing out I think it comes back to in our childhoods I mean that's what often a lot comes back to were we taught that we have an emotional life that lives inside of us then were we taught how to understand that emotional life then were we taught how to manage and cope with that whole emotional life most people were not so it becomes this very very complicated conundrum the emotional life is happening inside me again like you can't beat it it's happening our feelings can't get rid of them and they're very powerful they're Sensations but if your framework is was always you're getting punished you're getting ridiculed you're being a baby then you you develop a very conflictual relationship with your feelings like I they can't be real they almost can't be mine that's really they can't be mine people like this often blame other people a lot for things they never did when they're really frustrated and upset cuz it's almost like this can't be mine so like who did this feeling to me you know there's in the world a lot of that in the world who did this feeling to me who put this in me right um it's it's so fragile and so sad almost um and and so you know toxic um but projection in a way is the only way that I can understand my emotional life is by imagining you having an emotional life I don't know like a a lot of these things I hear myself say this I I like Mell I was like oh that's what a vulnerable way to go about the world what an awful way to live in your body that you're so overwhelmed and almost um so self- abandoning of the information in your body that it must be someone else's you know so that's so that's what projection is right so what do we do when we see it right um I don't know what's an example right like you're so stressed out you've been so stressed and you're thinking maybe you're thinking a partnership like I feel like you're you're the one who stressed right never helps In the Heat of a moment to be right I I've tried it a million times I don't know about you to be right in an AR be right to be right in a heated moment when you're like I'm going to be right not if you want an effect effective outcome no no but it's a very hard urge to resist it took me many years to learn but someone taught it to me in one hour uh I feel very grateful that that she taught me this that she didn't tell me to do it but I just realized if you just like I don't have any word other than just like soften yes if you just kind of like um imagine becoming more like a noodle than a like a rigid bar of iron I just like and I actually I I think of um the way that like my he always comes up but my this Bulldog Mastiff Costello was like super lazy the contract with him was he would protect me with his entire life but if my life wasn't on the line Noodle and I remember just thinking like if I just go there yeah then the basic contract of like I care about you I'll protect you with my life is still there so I guess I learned it from my Bulldog but it sort of played out in a in a romantic relationship and it was just really beautiful it was one of the best things I learned um that from the two of them yeah um is that I just like literally like physically soft often then like everything becomes apparent somehow for me it allows me to get back into my own eggshell y but still have Optics out now that's me I realize it's it you know and that doesn't mean in the In the Heat of the Moment I'm not like feeling like I want to be reactive right but for me a physical change to my body self-directed physical change to my body is what just kind of like changed everything yeah and and I think you know this is so true in relationships definitely at work and definitely in parenting is you don't have to represent everything you believe in like a given moment like we're not so fragile like to be like no and you're projecting like I have time like I this is this is a heated moment I can kind of chill out you're so stressed and I think I'm not I think there's projection I might say like oh I am who cares just like get through the moment right and then maybe after if it feels important I say feel like this thing happens sometimes where when you're stressed you say I'm stressed I don't know like like let's talk about this that that's when that happens I think this is really true with kids too right has happened the other day and in some ways it's the same strategy which I jokingly on Instagram called do nothing with the capital D and a capital N because so many times in hard situations especially when you're accused of something that's not true people will say to parents oh so you're just going to do nothing well I'm like take away the just like doing nothing nothing in a heated moment is a very sophisticated technique because really what you're saying is you're doing nothing on the outside and you're being a adult and managing your feelings on the inside Amen to that versus doing nothing on the inside and just yelling or reacting on the outside so the other day my son came to me before school my youngest and he goes my sweatshirt's still dirty and I was like oh man he go you promised me you would wash my sweatshirt before coool between us he never he never asked me that okay and here's my fork in the road it's like we all know what it would be easier and what I by by the way I wanted to say back to him 99% of me was about to go you never asked me and then he said I did no you didn't and now you're lying to me and all of a sudden it's like okay you know what he was saying to me I wish my sweatshirt was clean that's what he was saying that's what we're all saying and I'm so upset about it the feeling is so big that it's like too overwhelming in this moment as a 7-year-old to be mine so like I kind of have to make it your fault to try to make sense of it so what did I do in the moment I literally did nothing what I you promised me you watch my sweatshirt and I went like this I kind of was just like looking at him like I knew what it was like to want something and not be able to have it and he's like you did in the moment I go I did that sweatshirt is dirty he really wanted it to be clean just kind of he's like I really did I was like that's the worst not joking then he at the End by five minutes later I didn't say anything he got another sweatshirt we moved on I didn't say I wasn't going to like ruin the moment by being like see you could cope or you never asked me but I think in both these moment whether someone saying you're stressed or my kids accusing me I think about this a lot in parenting I don't have to prove my parenting in a moment I don't have to prove it to my kid I don't have to prove it cuz my mother-in-law is watching like I trust myself way more than I trust one single moment to represent everything about me and I think when we can gain a little bit of that confidence we have a lot more freedom to just be effective and to also know there's a moment moment to do nothing and then if something's a chronic issue if my son's chronically blaming me when things are less heated I'm going to say to him you know something in you know a calm moment there super important and novel approaches to things that I think um everybody deals with um kids in the picture or not I um my audience sometimes gets angry with me when I um ask very long extended questions but um could I just share with you something learned uh about an experiment because I thinke um it blew my mind it won't take long um there's a Imaging experiment so you put people in a scanner they image their brain see which areas are active fmri there's a really wild experiment where they bring people in for the scan they don't tell them why they're there and they tell them they're going to be paid $30 and they set out um three $10 bills maybe you know this experiment I don't know and then they go into the scanner and then um they come out and then the researcher leaves and there's a discussion etc etc and um at some point one of the $10 bills is removed by the by the researcher and people are told at the end of the experiment um you took one of the $10 bills and they're like no I didn't because they didn't nobody says you're right but then they reimage them and they compare that to a condition in other subjects where people actually did a little sneaky steal during a money game and the same areas of the brain light up that we think are associated with guilt in other words if somebody is told that they did something even if they know they didn't there are aspects of brain circuitry that reflect a quote unquote feeling of guilt it's like it introduces this question about reality and so they can know with 100% certainty you can know with 100% certainty that you did not do something and yet it starts to introduce these questions about how you gauge reality simply because somebody you just met a few minutes earlier yes in a position of authority they're the researcher you're the subject Etc told you that you did it I think this has huge implications for parent child relationships for romantic relationships workplace relationships for um real bias in the outside world you can imagine if you're told your whole life that like you're a piece of garbage or that you're part of a bad group or something like this like I'm not trying to get political here like you could come to believe that at a level that is biological even if cognitively doesn't make sense so this is where I think about this like challenging um boundary between knowing what we know being a container staying in our frame you know pick your favorite lingo around this and the fact that words and the emotions of other people really do um have the capacity to rewire us on the inside you know a question I'd have about that study I'd be really curious if there was variation among subjects where some people that guilt part lit up a lot more okay so you reminded me so so this is the wild part okay the distribution of kind of like uh people who have this by the way folks there aren't single brain areas for whole emotions but let's just for sake of Simplicity here that have the guilt area activated even when they didn't take the money yes the entire population of subjects doesn't experience that to the same degree you have these people who for whom it's very high amplitude response and others who aren't now I don't recall and I need to go back and look at the study if it divided according to male female because earlier you said that this tendency um I would bet a million dollars that if I got to know those people the people who really light up have a lot of focus on gazing out and determining their inner Reality by what other people think about them and the people who did not light up as much are the people who gaze in and have a deep sense of themselves even in the face of kind of a lack of validation or even in the face of criticism I would bet my money on that psychological kind of is that a moderator or a mediator I don't know you would tell me so I'd be very curious about that great well I have no skin in the game like I didn't run this study and I'll go back and check it out it's a collection of studies and I hadn't known about this I mean I read the Neuroscience literature but I hadn't known about this I find it like a complete yes of course on the one hand and also super surprising on the other and just oh so cool yeah um in the sense that it's informative and it's making me think that some people really need to do the work of paying more attention to other people's emotions and feeling them a little bit more and other people probably need to do the exact opposite that's exactly right and to me like I always I say this people I manage I said like I think about this in general with adults like I think such a empowering thing as an adult is just to know where you are in any given scale so for me as a leader I'm always gas I'm like go go go we can do this we can get this accomplished I'm probably like pretty far in that and given that I know it's really important for me to have people around me who sometimes say like whoa let's look at this first right um I also know that sometimes if I do have a like maybe I should slow this down I should like really listen to that cuz that's like not right but knowing where I am on a scale is important I I I talk about someone in that I manage who she really needs to be more direct with the people she manages just like you know like sometimes ask questions when she really wants statements and can have a little higher standard and I think it's it's helpful to know where she is in that scale because remember saying like I want you to go as far as you can toward the other direction without being disrespectful because it's almost impossible to do that right and so I think for adults to know let's say i gaze in or I more gaze out neither is better or Worse probably again mental health and resilience is about having just a lack of rigidity and so to say what is my starting point like anyone listening what is my starting point there's no morality it's literally not better or worse it just gives me information about which direction to experiment with and I like to make this a concrete experiment right so let's say you are someone who tends to gaze out before you gaze in and you're always like I can't do this thing I want to do because it would incon someone I told this story the other day on my Instagram and people went bananas about it I was at the airport and I got a cup of coffee in the morning um and I like my coffee with just like a really little bit of milk right and and I I know to specify it if I'm asking someone else so I went to the counter and I said hey can I get a medium coffee not black just a little little bit of milk pretty close to Black sure no problem I go I wait in the line then it's on the counter I pick it up Becky and it's like light as can be I got back online I brought the coffee and I said hey h i' asked for this I know there's a lot of people probably got lost could you asked for this you know darker could you pour out a good amount of this and then refill it with coffee the person you know who knows if it could have gone differently different day should oh right no problem here you go this happens with things that are so much bigger than coffee but the coffee example is such a good one because what I'm doing in that moment is I'm saying I'm allowed to have my coffee the way I wanted it and asked for it even if it's awkward or inconveniences the other person now can people be on the opposite extreme and can someone hear this and be like I probably need to do a little bit less of my own needs that's what I'm saying you have to know where you are but what I have found at least with moms is the idea of O you know I asked for milk and this is whole milk or I always I used to give my clients this experiment who had this struggle I said I want you at the grocery store after basically done checking out to say oh you know what I actually don't need those paper towels I can't even tell you people are like I can't do that I can't like return it like oh my goodness it like a panic attack and the Panic the Panic feeling is that would be a completely new circuit that would be me saying I'm willing to do something to meet my own needs I actually don't need that paper towel even though it could get an iral or inconvenience temporarily someone else those little experiments and it might be the opposite it might be saying to my partner tonight you know what we always sit down and talk about my work and I actually did have a stressful day but you know what I want to hear about your day you go first that that's also an experiment and for someone who's on that extreme they're going to also have a panic attack they're going to be like this is deeply uncomfortable but just knowing where you are in the Spectrum gives you the information you need to get a little bit of balance yeah I think there's clearly a distribution and um whether or not it's too whether not it's a binary distribution or it's kind of like a normal distribution I I don't know but there's clearly variance here from one person to the next and probably even depending on how well rested we are and all the rest but I do think that we do kind of fall into phenotypes of yeah prone to um reacting to other people's emotions without hearing and listening to and responding to ours first like truly ours first versus people who are just really out there I I realized it's very different than any other kind of relationship but when I first went from being a postto to having my own laboratory the chair in my department my chairman in one department anyway he said you know you should get a great big desk that's like really thick I was like yeah like why I mean I get it you don't want to be sitting like right next to your employees or something but like why so that and he goes so that when they cry you won't feel like you need to cry or take care of them you'll just slide the kleenex across the desk and I was like are you kidding he was like no and then uh years later um I looked back and I realized I understood what he was saying I mean he didn't know me at all but he was just saying probably something about himself which is people are going to come into your office they're going to cry it does happen and you're going to need need to be the boss which is to be supportive and empathic but like you can't get pulled into it because they might be crying about something they don't like about the lab or about something not happening the way they want it I mean who could imagine any other reason to cry in your your boss's office but maybe they have a family issue and you know you have to remember you're the boss and I thought oh that's interesting I ended up with a dust that was kind of medium in in in width but I think that nowadays there's a lot more um kind of bleeding of Ro and um you know it used to be that everyone got really dressed up for work now dressing down is like common in certain circumstances and not others I think that there's a lot of um kind of lack of clarity about here we go again you know power and authority and and but also kind of staying in our own frame versus taking on someone else's frame yeah um you know I have a friend who runs a pretty large business and he did the same experiment that you did of asking people um you know how he could do better but first he unfortunately made the mistake of asking people how they felt about being there and they ended up with making one of these emotion clouds where they took everyone filled out a thing and wrote what the most dominant emotions were and then he told this story like call me late at night he sits down and they're going to present this as data in front of everybody and this emotion Cloud comes up and the biggest bubble in the middle just says stress and he was mortified right but he learned that they all feel really really really stressed that sort of exercise would never have happened 10 15 years ago yeah it's like yeah like I won't say what profession he's in for sake of privacy but like it's a profession where stress is part of the process and you don't kind of get the certificate at the end so to speak if you don't experience stress but this actually relates to what we started with in a way I'm going to circle it back there which is and CU I hear this a lot you know H kind of some kids these days they they don't they don't know how to tolerate stress or they're always overwhelmed but part of it is again maybe this is my MGI maybe they haven't been told the right story about stress or anxiety it this came up with my kids the other day my older son had his first basketball game um of the season and he goes oh I'm really nervous feeling a little anxious and it's just so interesting like the way we respond we respond in little ways to our kids in these moments form like the way they and end up thinking about those feelings later on I said well of course you're nervous n being nervous means you care you really care about basketball right and obviously we've had many conversations about What feelings mean but it was so interesting I watched him go yeah yeah I do care kind of in that little sentence being nervous means you care I mean think about it you're never nervous about anything you don't care about right if being nervous means I care I have a story to understand it I now inherently feel like the feeling is normal I'm almost I'm almost like proud you know like yeah I do care right my relationship with that feeling is going to be so different than if my parents like why are you nervous there's nothing to be nervous about or oh you're nervous oh does that mean you're not going to play well oh my goodness are you're going to miss your foul shots like I mean so in the first right my kid feels like being nervous is wrong so I just set them up to feel like they're feeling the wrong feeling when they're feeling nervous going on and the second I'm layering on my anxiety to their nervousness not a great combo but the stories we tell matter so in the workplace you're stressed yeah you know actually this makes me think maybe not right now when more time it'll be really helpful to talk about what what is stress why do we feel stress how do we talk to ourselves when we feel stressed does anyone here know the way you talk to yourself when you're stressed has the power to make stress feel a little smaller or a little bigger that's really interesting I wonder do anyone here use a session should we do something in the workplace about how to deal with stress because you're right this is a stressful job and and this is where I don't think about power but Authority and I want to own that and let you know that stress comes along with this type of job I'm making this up and this is why you get paid pretty well and this is why you know whatever else could be true but one of my jobs is not just being honest but actually helping everyone develop the best skills that maybe no one ever taught them before to manage stress let me know if that's of Interest I just think about that like the whole mood just changed you kind of own your Authority and you own the story and I think whether you're talking about being a CEO or being a parent it's actually all the same that makes sense I have a rule which is if my pulse rate goes above a certain limit I my thumbs stop working meaning I won't allow myself to text I don't I don't talk on the phone I'll just I'll go in the bathroom and just sit for a second if I have to but that's rare typically I just I'm like I have a rule my heart rate goes up my thumbs don't work what do you do I just do nothing I follow the do nothing thing I just wait I mean I I also have a rule which is unless somebody's hemorrhaging right in front of me um it usually can wait drives people crazy but they thank me later like unless somebody's literally hemorrhaging like I can pause my response um because I'm going kind of like move fast get things done kind a person and actually it was taught to me by a chairman of a major university in your home city of New York City he said um there's always more time and I said that's ridiculous he said unless somebody's hemorrhaging right in front of you there's always more time going back to my daughter it's it's one of the mantras that's been really helpful for me as someone who again just knowing myself I always like to go go go I get so much pleasure probably identity value from doing things and so a byproduct of that is I always kind of feel like I'm in a rush because my body craves movement and checking things off but being in a rush is never terribly helpful in close relationships no one likes to feel like come on you get to the end of the story or you it's not good so sometimes I think efficiency and relationship building are like antithetical I amen a thousand times over no I I don't think we can be efficient in relationships it it's like efficiency and other things is beautiful um well it's a unitary experience being efficient in relation and so like when I can be in efficiency a lot mode a lot and it's something that I have to really think when I'm going home to my closest relationships and it's interesting now that I work so much more than I used to it's almost reinforcing the efficiency mode so I I really know I to you know my own therapy like really work on like that's not a value of mine all the time at work maybe sometimes even there sometimes you got to get out of it to connect to people right and so that is something again where like knowing where I am on that scale asking people to call me out oh Mom you're rushing me at night Becky I want to tell you the whole story I'm not just trying to give you the tldr I want the experience of telling you the story I'm like right I'm doing that thing yeah slowing down is rarely a mistake I guess I guess occasionally but uh rarely a mistake it's really true I'd like to talk a little bit about technology I know this is a a growing interest of yours i' I've been thinking a little bit um based on our earlier discussion about s of people who are in their own container or or sensing what's going on inside them prior to paying attention to and sensing what's going on in other people because clearly both are important I don't like this idea that it's like one or the other but with the Advent of text messaging so here I'm not going to talk about social media this is not about social media uh with text messaging is this first of all this is the first time in human evolution that humans have written with their thumbs um that's weird um been kind of quirky uh reflection but the other one is this is the first time in human evolution meaning very recently that we are aware of what's going on with so many other people and we expected to at least know it and perhaps even respond to it I mean if you it's just I know people younger than 30 are probably going wait no it's always been this way but it wasn't always this way clearly our brain has adapted to this new format but it did not evolve in this format whereby you're getting on a plane and you look at your phone and you are aware of the movements and requests and um maybe kind statements Etc from other people we're tethered in so many ways and that means that our brain is really Tethered to the states of others their emotional states their physical states where they are you said and I'll keep repeating it because I love it so much the more you can locate somebody uh the more it reflects their values so being able to locate somebody in space and time and understand how bounded they are or not to their own emotions or yours fantastic but the fact that you have 10 people in your phone that are that you're aware of you're not even supposed to be aware of 10 people at once except the 10 people perhaps around you on the you know boarding a plane yeah um so we're being forced to navigate a new landcape with all this yes um after this conversation folds we'll look at our phones you couldn't have that many I guarantee one thing no matter how many text messages or few text messages you have it's far more conversations if if you will than you could possibly have by phone at once yep so in the old days you left messages and you'd get on the phone when you could not saying we go back to that but I think we might be asking ourselves to do something that is impossibly hard and maybe even bad for us yeah I don't know how um apocalyptic you want me to get about this um but I think I actually you know my husband and I were talking about phones and text and social media and AI um and I brought up something to him he's like I don't think I in all the arguments I've heard I haven't heard that where I feel like we're changing in a dramatic way um our basic evolutionary drive around attachment in a way where attachment has always been the primary evolutionary Drive of humans and with all the different technological shifts there have been cuz people say oh there's been this there been this what's never been shifted is kind of the nature really of onetoone human attachment we're entering into something really new where let's even say text messages 20 at once 10 at once our bodies like will always crave what's immediately gratifying over what is longterm good for us it's just it's and I the way another way I think about it is our bodies will always choose convenience and ease and gratification over what's good for us long term so you they about all these pings coming in it's a lot of information this text that text this text this text and what you're doing in your circuitry and over time evolutionarily is getting used to the multiplicity of relationships the multiplicity of information it's just more gratifying than oneon-one to the point that one-on-one conversation over text or even in person is going to have so much more of a gap than it ever has been in terms of how slow how low stem and how boring and awkward it is compared to especially for kids who get this early the constant information flow and gratification and stimulation I think that's going to have a profound impact not right away but over time then if you add in social media and then if you add in AI I mean on the way humans just are even able to relate to each other so yes I think like this advancement in technology and what's happening I think there's always been a trade-off always between how short-term gratifying something is and how long-term good something is for us because the things that are really good for humans longterm are the things that involve humans to tolerate frustration I would say that is the most important skill I think for kids to learn but the world more than ever it is built now with insanely low frustration tolerance cuz we're bu for so much information so much consumption and so much media gratification this is actually I think the thing that isn't talked about with technology it's why parenting has changed it's why so much of parenting is about making kids happy and their lives easy because there's never been a generation of parents like my generation where our lives are just so much easier we have so much less tolerance for our kids Tantrums because we're on our phones wanting our life to be easier so we stop the Tantrum we make their life easier we make them anxious we make them fragile because of our lowered frustration tolerance so I don't know where we're Landing here but and by the way I text like I'm not like a purist here you know I I'm a realist I live in the world you know um but I I think it's profound how it's changing human interaction and expectations and gratification and my colleague Anna lmy who wrote dopamine Nation right cited some data that uh humans have more free time now across socioeconomic groups more free time for everybody than ever before more expectation of immediate gratification and it's not just the text that we're getting it's um for some people the text that they're not getting they're thinking about the people that they haven't heard back from Etc I mean like you the number of tethers right exactly like the number the number of tethers is just um is just astonishing um I had a conversation with somebody recently that popped to mind where it was a little bit it was like a low friction one that ended in a really good place where I said you know the problem is you know what I was talking about there's a little bit of an age Gap and I said you know the problem is you think slow is low like what I was saying was I like to just chill this is something I haven't done enough of in my life because I'm pretty ambitious person and always have been since I was little um about everything but I've learned that like slow isn't low like I love just like sitting down and like hanging out with the dog or just it's like slowing down and it used to feel like slow was low it used to feel like oh nothing's happening or this is depressing or it's boring and I think in recent years that became more and more the case as I got more and more pulled into technology and then I did a little bit of a technology distancing experiment if you will I have this wooden box that someone made for me and I put my phones in there and it's so amazing how once you put the phone in a different container it like completely changes the relationship to it I don't get it but any anyway again physical barriers to make to take emotional steps always a good idea um and I just realized like slow isn't low like slow is awesome so I totally agree that the circuits of our brain have now adapted to expect immediate gratification I like to think and maybe this is a um a false um wish but I like to think that there are components of our brain that are hardwired enough through tens or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution that might be able to recognize and appreciate the slow moments and not feel like slow is low meaning slow is depressing um but I do think that if one is weaned in uh raised in an environment where you expect things quickly well then you know it's going to feel like the horse and cart compared to the car at some level I do agree and I think for parents who have you young kids I think these are such powerful and empowering things to think about when your kids are young because I think it's easy to think well okay so I'll deal with this when my kid gets a phone it's the circuits surround even how your kid will use the phone how much you're going to be able to set boundaries with your kid when they get a phone all these have to do with the patterns early on right so if we go back to slow is good frustration and frustration tolerance is the name of the game it requires a lot of inconvenient moments that matter so so much for how not only your kid learns to tolerate the frustration inherent in life but I think this is really important how your kid learns to feel capable kids only develop capability from watching themselves get through hard things they don't develop capability by being successful ever in some ways it builds up this pressure and a fragility if that's been the only thing they have and when we think about this whole generation who's so anxious kind of so fragile I really believe the antidote to anxiety is capability and we I'll give an example like we steal our kids capability all the time when they're young in the name of short-term convenience for everyone so here's an example like my I remember this day my oldest who's now 13 was like three and he was really into puzzles when he was three puzzles are like really hard right he was working on it something like I can't do it you know the classic wine which I just want everyone to know like no part of me is like I love that sound no like nobody likes whining okay but to me those are our like bang for our buck moments you know they're not our easy moments they're our bang for our buck my kid is going to learn something about how to deal with situations they don't think they're capable of completing that is such an important lesson and I have a fork in the road I can I can either do the puzzle for him which gives me short-term convenience stops the Meltdown but beyond frustration tolerance like one of the things I really remember thinking when my my kid was young is if I do it for him I'm stealing his capability because if he can get through this and kind of get to the point where he says I did a puzzle I didn't think I could do that's incredible so I I I remember this cuz it's it it felt so he's still whine but there are these moments as a parent and this is what like to help parents with our wins are not based on our kids' reactions our wins happen when you just know there's this amazing feeling you have of a parent I know that was important I know it and I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation sweetie I'm not going to do the puzzle for you and I I want to tell you why the feeling you get when you think you can't do something kind of take a deep breath maybe take a break maybe even the next day watch yourself do that that thing is literally the best feeling in the world it is the best feeling it becomes addictive and I will not take that feeling away from you because I believe you're going to get it I could cry like and one of the things I I feel like people hear the story like okay back great you know I do not do that all the time sometimes I finish the puzzle but when we think about what we want for our kids later in life it might be no I'm not getting you a phone yet how a kid reacts to to that situation it's not just about a phone it's kind of well have you always just done the thing for me have you always just given me what I want do I have any ability to feel like I can tolerate frustration and wait and figure things out that all layers into how kids react not getting a phone how kids approach hard math problems how kids do or do not sit down to start their English essay that is difficult to do and all that stuff you can start building those skills in the teenage years don't get me wrong but the the leg up your kid has at 14 when they've been basically building those life and academic skills from the start and they've built their identity around capability like that's what I want to give every parent and every kid in the world yeah it's awesome you know I said it last time we spoke I'll say it again you know if you're if you're thinking of adopting I'm I'm be happy to uh put myself up for adoption it's such a beautiful um philosophy and stance to take around effort and frustration I mean uh again this isn't about my life but I feel so blessed that came up in science where things take forever you can work two years on a project and then discover you do the right control experiment and you like we got nothing like like literally we have nothing yeah um there wasn't and there still isn't a tendency to publish what are called negative results which aren't bad results but where you basically got nothing you can find a flaw and the the reagents you're using you got nothing you're starting again Y and to have that so you know a few few times and to have some papers take two three four years to get accepted other papers 6 months I'll tell you the six months feels really short but these days we we get so much immediate gratification yes the other day I was staying at a hotel and um I ordered food in I don't do it that often I was like I really want like a poke ball there's that Pokeball place I ordered it was there in 11 minutes I was like whoa like this is so wild I was like I got to be careful not because I'll overeat pokeballs you can only have so many Pokeballs but it's like you just it's there convenience it's so you know it's it's incredible I remember and sad and scary and exciting and and all the things you know so I think having variable um durations of effort reward uh in one's life and being able to see where like the latency is very short yes social media but you know other things that where you have longer duration effort to reward um contingencies I'm sounding kind of this like nerd speak but I've gone on records before and I'll say again that you know dopamine that is achieved without effort preceding it is just be really careful doesn't matter if it's amphetamine cocaine social media or anything else um you get used to the schedule that's right and and I think we need to be able to tolerate and enjoy and lean into and Savor variable schedules of effort and reward it's so interesting to say that I have two thoughts that number one when I think about the puzzle situation that's like f eort cuz effort effort effort struggle deep breath effort effort nope that's not it effort effort and then you get the dopamine that circuit I just always think that is such a benefit to my kid later in life it's kind of the opposite of you know which we all do sometimes but if it's the only circuit being on your iPad all the time as a little kid and the no effort all the dopamine well I think about it as a a friend used to call it years ago birthday money there's one time each year okay maybe because of the holidays when you're supposed to get presents just for being you it's called your birthday right or if you're a kid you know or whatever holidays are where we celebrate kids by giving um presents or we celebrate each other but every other day you're not supposed to get rewards necessarily just because not just for being you the the rewards are out there in life and appreciating things I'm not trying to be too stoic here but there's only one day each year where you get literally presence just for being you the other stuff is supposed to require effort yeah and struggle I think you know it's really interesting my my second um had a lot of speech issues when she was younger and I kind of noticed it like at a certain age you're supposed to be building sounds and words and she was replacing like as soon as she had a new sound she lost one and just had a sense something was going on she had a pretty serious speech araxia she had to go to speech therapy um 3 days a week right for probably a year she now you wouldn't know but it was interesting I remember at that time my older one probably five maybe she was two or three and six and I remember someone saying to me like oh about my daughter like oh poor her kind of you know it's like a lot and and I don't think I said this but it's so interesting I remember thinking she's way better off than my son if I'm going to worry about one of my kids right now which I'm not worried about either I'd worry about my son his early years were so linear so without struggle like she's going to have an early experience of struggling working hard she won't remember it with her words but that circuitry which are our important Memories the ones we don't remember with our words the ones that our bodies remember she has such an early experience with watching herself struggle and get to the other side like I would wish that for every child and so I I also think I I want to also share that story because I think parents who have kids who have those early issues it's so easy like oh I actually think it's really empowering to do a complete 180 to be like wait I'm not going to fix this right away I'm going to support my child I'm going to let them know I believe in them I'm going to let them know I see a version of them that's going to get through this they're going to still struggle and that is actually going to be like the best foundation and almost like the best leg up yeah I have a friend very very successful um who told me that he wasn't until you know until he was in his 40s that he had like kind of a major um difficult life a major business disappointment and it almost crushed him like you know but he had never had that before yeah he had been so successful uccessful over and over again you know it was fun for me to talk to my dad recently on the podcast because we haven't had a conversation like that ever um and we were talking about sort of mistakes that one makes and um in the context of you know work etc and he said still ringing in my ears he said well you know those those humiliations are actually good for us he called them humiliations I was like really I was like yeah you know they they humble us and they keep us um thoughtful about what we're doing next I was like yeah but it was kind of wild to hear that um I don't know why I need to hear it externally because I know it's true I knew it was true but yeah it's not just making mistakes like sometimes listen I'm fully against bullying where I understand how that can be very destructive but like there are going to be times when we're going to feel humiliated and to be able to bounce back from that is pretty awesome I I actually think that builds character strength I do yeah and I think you know this is like a a great lead into parenting I hear this all the time where someone will say I don't know if my kid's being bullied but like they're you know they were told you can't play basketball with us you're the worst basketball player in the grade something like that right where the way I work with parents right is again assuming this isn't chronic I don't think Step One is calling the school I don't think Step One is calling the other parent right if you zoom out you're right like I don't think a kid's going to be called the water basball player you know over and over in the course of the next couple decades but they will be called some something they'll be left out or even if nothing happens you know what's going to happen they're going to feel less then in a group like probably a million times I do right still so we have this almost opportunity of like okay well what skills would be useful when my kid is 18 and 30 and actually the struggle again is my opportunity I was think my kids are in my home for 18 years I sounds like sick and I don't know if I really mean this but I'm going to say it like I almost hope they have all the variations of struggles they're going to have later on cuz then at least I can kind of get in it with them and like build some skills and help them see that they can manage and then I feel like those bumps are going to happen right I I guess it is like Pilots don't they when they have simulations there's no way they simulate perfect flights and say you're ready to fly they simulate all the issues so that a pilot can learn the right controls and then they're really prepared they don't take away the issues right no I I I love the analogy of flying because I you know I I'll never forget driving in really thick fog for the first time this happens if you grow grow up in the Bay Area just being able to see one reflector at a time and being terrified now like driving in fog never feels great but I've been there it's like it's a familiar feeling and um yeah I've been thinking a lot these days about um this whole thing about proficiency and and uh our our expectation of kids now noway you know that we have been told for a long time that we need to guard against kids feeling terrible about themselves on the other hand we want them to be proficient and what you're really talking about here if I understand correctly is proficiency at Being Human at being really good at certain things less good at others I can also tell you know any any kid because I was this kid like in in a group of musicians I'm the least proficient I mean you really just don't talk about wanting someone to do nothing I'm best off not even playing the triangle okay like just doing nothing would be the best thing I could do to any musical effort it's just but I realized that at some point even though every kid in my school played an instrument they had like the youth Symphony and all that kind of stuff because it was also a time when I could just kind of relax like you don't have to be certainly best at everything but I also believe that in order to really find what you're kind of quote unquote meant for you have to try a bunch of things and find out what you're never going to even approach partially skilled at you still have to try I guess that's the point so on the one hand I guess I'm saying do nothing on the other hand I'm saying you still have to try I guess you have to try to find out that you're really as bad at music as I found out I am maybe or I think we're also talking I'm good with it I'm good with it I love music but I don't need to play it but I think then what you're saying is you're able to separate your identity from any Behavior being bad at music doesn't mean you're a bad person and I think anyone hears that they're like obviously but we conflate those two things 90% of the time right that's why we really care about winning at Scrabble is like to some degree we think it means we're smart and everyone's like you know versus I'm probably the same level of smart whether I win at Scrabble or lose at Scrabble right and to me that's what confidence is it's not feeling like you're the best at something it's feeling like it's okay to be you when you're not the best at something right it's feeling at home with yourself and to me feeling at home with yourself is first of all it's an amazing internal motivator because you get to also figure out what you're really passionate about right um and yeah learning to participate in things and even have joy in things that you're not great at again these are things I think our kids really can learn not from lessons not from a textbook not really from a teacher they learn it from what we model it's actually interesting we play a ton of board games in my family and I'm just I think they're like the antidote to everything on the screen so we have a million board games I'm the resident if anyone ever needs a recommendation what's your your favorite board game to play as a family okay I Love Sushi go God don't know it but I'll check out go party is the better version it's actually a really great adult game too it's very strategic we play code names we play a lot of word games we Play Boggle we play Ghost we play Scrabble um we play rumy Q um but the game I was going to say that we also play a lot of that I love is categories okay so have you ever played that yeah that's a fun game I whatever part of the brain is good at generating a lot of different things from a single letter is must be very small in my brain I am so bad at categories I mean my kids are all pretty quick I lose to everyone my my seven-year-old included I'm horrible it actually is a game I suggest often I'm like let's play categories and I think there like that's actually so powerful for our kids I mean I think a lot of us if we look back we think like is one of the reasons my parents didn't really play with me or do things is like they felt like they weren't good at it you know like probably right to demonstrate to your kid I can choose something I can have joy in something I can want to do something that I'm not good at that is again going to be more powerful to your kid than sitting down and saying this is what we think is going to help kids it's okay to do things that you're not good at you and I know that's like logical words in the brain that's not an experience they're building or internalizing kids learn from stories from experiences and so I think that's one way in terms of how do I help my kids be confident but also just be at home with themselves and do things are not best stat probably the best way to do that is to model it over and over to your kids I love it we're back to uh Theory versus practice yes I'm big on practice maybe on both I feel like as long as there are kids and adults that seem I want to emphasize seem to do everything well you know the athlete academic you know musician uh Dan you know good dancer like as long as you know Charming with other people as as long as those people exist or seem to exist we're going to have to all overcome our sense that you know we should be at least partially good at a wide variety of things maybe not everything do you think those people exist no I know they don't exist I I know that there are people that apparently are like that um they're fakers well well I don't know you know I will say that I you know and and this is I don't get paid to say uh positive things about the University I work for um or not but the I will say occasionally I'll um meet a student from Stanford and I'm like goodness gracious like these this kid right can apparently do everything like they're an athlete and they're a musician they have all these things they they there are those people and I will say um but this is important the pressure that the perception of those people creates on them without fail brings them to immense challenge in their life if not then later I've seen it every single time I know because I grew up in the town where I'm now a professor and I went to school with many people who ended up there or or you know other places like that and of course there are people like that in every environment they are outliers they tend to be very Salient we tend to to notice them and um they create this you know false internal pressure this is the reason I raise it it and I want to say it's not like they eventually you know fail and dissolve into a puddle of their own Tears like hopefully they're resilient and they push forward in life and some of them do amazing things and some of them do less amazing things but the point is that there are people among our species that seem to do many many things very very well and I think when we hold ourselves to that standard um we uh we suffer and we hold ourselves back I think that I believe I just have a central belief that we all do have some unique gifts that we're meant to bring to our life and to the world and it shows up in different forms and one of the worst things we can do in trying to find that and express it is trying to be really good at everything uh I just think that's the most poisonous idea in the um American mindset that we're supposed to be really good at everything on the other hand I personally believe that we should try a variety of things so that we experience frustration and fail and eventually find what it is that is um you know we're quote unquote meant to do I do um but I feel also very fortunate that I was never really pushed to be excellent at everything yeah I have terrible hand eye coordination but I'm pretty good at sports with my feet but when I say pretty good I mean passable yeah so I gave up on the idea of becoming a professional athlete very very young so I think we have to know that we have to play games with our hands and our feet in order to figure that out yeah and I guess you know we were talking about this maybe before we started but I don't know I'm trying to think why this is but I tend I tend not to put anyone on a pedestal m I feel like and maybe part of it is in part of my private practice for years I saw maybe I saw the Stanford grads who are then living in New York and they weren't literally from Stanford but I have all these late 20y olds and they're pedigree like all look the same top of their class ivy league Goldman Sachs this MBA and like so many of them had the same like insane anxiety and emptiness I I still remember the way one of them described how they felt and she was brilliant with her words and she said I walk around and it's like when I'm with people and doing things and at work it's like there's a ton of color when I'm alone I feel like I am an empty room with white walls oh goodness that's very sad very sad very sad it actually has a a happy ending which is really um or has a Nuance ending but but happy ending where um she feel like it's actually I was actually saying this to a friend cuz I actually relates my own childhood I feel like I've you know grown a lot had my therapy and I feel like when I was younger I was really hard driving and really like sowhat people pleasing and me and my friend who are both like that were like that have kids who aren't really like that they and they're they're amazing kids and they do so well and they have this internal confidence but sometimes we joke we're like but there's nothing that will drive you like feeling not good enough there's nothing that drives you like feeling like every test score defines your self worth and it's so sick right because we're almost like conflicted with our kids like they they're they're all great kids they're responsible but they they almost have a little bit more inner contentment right um but I think about that young woman I saw and how at work she felt amazing until didn't happen until she was 28 she didn't get the promotion she thought she was getting and then I mean she had never failed before and it's not only the never failure when your internal sense of self is built outside in which you actually can do if you have a lot of accomplishments it works for a while but as soon as that stops working if you have nothing you feel like in an empty room with white walls what's really compelling about you know the therapy over the course of number of years is I is I still remember over covid we were then then zooming and she had had her own place um and she actually went through this process and she she was very artistic of of painting the walls in her actual room talking about making something concrete and like kind of in the way that she was was feeling a lot more lit up in inside out instead of outside in it's great um but I just think I guess I know myself too and maybe maybe this is part of why I try not to put people on a pedestal maybe it's as I'm talking people are like oh Becky gets it right with her kids and she's doing this and like whatever I can share like that that is that is part of my story I also yell at my kids I also feel like sometimes I'm on my phone too much I feel like my life is out of balance I don't get to see my friends nearly the way I used to they probably often are like Where's Becky why is she not you know not only was Ling to text but remembering my birthday or whatever I forget and that doesn't feel good to me because I used to do more of that and so no one no one has it all figured out like humans I think it's are remarkably complicated remarkably imperfect we all have parts of us that feel really good and we maybe some of us play up those parts more than others and we all have parts of us that that feel confusing maybe have some shame feel you know I don't know just more complicated and so at least want to get that out there about myself oh I really appreciate you sharing and I I want to be clear um if if I was at all unclear that I I certainly don't hold up these um uh Ultra performers in all domains on a pedestal I I think um they're in a very precarious place inside and outside they've essentially given up all their power and agency to one incoming failure and maybe they never experience it and they get to the end without having know but what what a terrible way to live anyway I I've always looked up since I was little too people that really um took a unique path I've always found that um they yes accomplish tremendous things and and they have um interesting sometimes painful flaws like I I'm a huge fan of of the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sachs very very incredible man very complicated life you know if you read his books his autobiography which I highly recommend everybody um do if you're interested in science um and just animals and and a a a life uniquely lived he's a really good example and there a bunch of other examples that are meaningful to me um certainly not somebody who you know he couldn't do an experiment to save his life he was um moved out of multiple universities and places you know a very very complicated character had a methamphetamine addiction um was a closet homosexual it came out later in life and was then long periods of time on his own and anyway had a great relationship later in life um very interesting um person uh became that way and found his Passion by realizing how terrible he was at certain things including certain branches of medicine so I think that trying many things and being really realistic about whether or not something's for us or not but uh is the key but then I guess the question becomes and this must be so hard from the perspective of parenting but also just in terms of guiding ourselves through life is you know how much friction do we experience before we say you know what like I'm not a musician and I'm cool with that I love music but I'm going to put my efforts into these other things and you know this thing comes more easily for me that you know I do think we have a lot of natural tendencies and I feel like especially in the United States there's been this complicated relationship with parenting and education whereby we we don't want to push people to their own you know like suffering and demise but we also have to avoid not pushing them because then they don't ever find what they are proficient in and they don't learn that overcoming friction thing um so it's It's Tricky I do believe everyone has a unique expression of themselves in life whatever that is doesn't have to be in professional life but you to try a lot of different things and you know how at what point you uh you bail out I mean I've had few in my lab but I've spoken to graduate students in posto where I had to say you know what I actually had this conversation with the post I was like you know what you're a really good scientist you're never going to be a professor let's get you a job in biotech and they were like they thought their whole life they were going to be a professor like you're not and the data are the following which point to that and it's kind of devastating but then years later they thank me or they thanked me in that case yeah a few others probably curs me but so how do you know when to keep pushing your kid to even engage in something like maybe they're the kid that always is picked last for the team but you know they should play sports so I guess my first reaction is I'm I'm reacting to the word pushing cuz I'm not not sure that's the like the verb I would think about because I think the idea of pushing your kid even like how much do I push there's there's a lot about us there is like is that my I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed oh I mean I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed so maybe that's why I know something about it right I mean I think we see this all the time and it goes back to actually what side of the tennis court like whose feelings are who's like is this my unlived dreams as a athlete in my youth or is this actually about my kid soccer skills you know I think parents watching their kids playing sports is a prime example of am I living out my unfulfilled dreams and projecting that onto my daughter or does my daughter like soccer and like how can I really differentiate those right I think actually though making it back to that a lot of this actually goes back to frustration tolerance and why it matters so much to me like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance which is like a Hidden Gem we have here at good inside I really want I I want to be in every school I think it needs to be in every school and I want to describe it to you okay so I I literally have this graph it's helpful and I know you like to write things down to to make it concrete we're like point one is not knowing how to do something okay and point two which is very far away is let's say knowing how to do it or being very proficient this could be soccer I think a good example is reading okay like you everybody starts out not knowing how to read and let's say not everybody but a large a lot of people learn how to read the fr the the the space between not knowing and knowing I call the Learning space it has a name and it's helpful to know where you are in a map and the learning space has one feeling that you're supposed to have frustration that is the feeling you're supposed to have and we have this idea that we sh from not knowing to knowing like this it's because of those damn Star Wars movies and oh no actually Star Wars Incorporated some frustration but it's because of movies boom you're supposed to just have the skill because you picked up the rock or the sword or the the pen or the wand well and now it's because if you think about the circuitry that kids get used to with dopamine and the space between wanting and having in general is low because when you don't know something you want to know it here you do know it our tolerance and our kids tolerance for wanting and not having is so low that what's so sad is the learning space has gotten massively compressed and people fear frustration this image when I've gone over this with kids and even teachers I know teachers who teach us in their class okay today we're going to learn this new thing we're going to learn whatever it is the you know how to read a short word everybody in this class is here not knowing everybody in this class is going to get here and probably today most of us and you can actually do it m are going to be right here what does this say the learning space how are we supposed to feel when we're in the learning space the class can say frustrated okay here's an interesting assignment different than you think the goal today is not to tell me if you can read the letters that are in front of you I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated which feels like this oh I can't do it because I'm going to come up to you and I'm going to give you a high five and I'm going to say you are in the learning space you are learning how amazing is that like Andrew I really believe this has like the power to change learning because then when we talk about proficiency or when we talk about years from now my kid is saying this happens all the time I get questions about this all the time my kid says they want to do whatever is it could be a coding class it could be a lacrosse class and they do it once and then they always come home and they say I want to do it I quit or maybe they're on a swim team they want to quit do I let my kid quit right to me the question is actually like most likely none of our kids are going to be Olympic swimmers or like professional basketball players I think about this a lot with orts the whole goal in my mind for most people with orts not everyone but most is learning how to deal with frustration learning how to do things you thought you couldn't do character sharing being a good teammate sportsmanship right all those things are hard skills to learn so the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball is actually just because it's like a good medium for all those things and so I want to be sure that if my kid is quitting it's not because they're escaping the very very natural learning space that is so important to be in in life and this happened actually my oldest wanted to quit baseball he' played for years and he wanted to quit in in the conversation we ended up having was look let's wait to the end of the season like and this goes back to values it's not we don't quit but like in our family we we really value and try as much as we can to keep our commitments and not just to ourselves to each other and so the rest of the season you might be thinking all the time I don't want to be doing this and again in my head I'm thinking good that's like a good life experience to watch yourself go through that as long as it's not toxic and at the end you know we'll talk talk about it interestingly enough he had the best baseball season he'd ever had he had a grand slam which no shade to baseball that's as exciting as youth baseball ever gets right and still he was like they I'm done like I just want and I felt really good about that I was like look you you you ended on like you're playing really well it wasn't just cuz you got moved down in the batting order like if that's the reason why I K get moved down to the batting order they're not starting on basketball I hear this all the time now they want to quit I don't have any any rigid rules but if that becomes a pattern that worries me or not worries me but forget you sports that's just not a great circuitry that would be conducive with kind of resilience and confidence in adulthood look I love love love this concept which I believe to be entirely true that the learning space between unskilled and skilled if you will yes that's what it is is characterized by the feeling of frustration in mind and body yes I don't want to Rattle off another experiment but there is just oh so much date I I'll share this with you offline um the papers that is showing that brain plasticity changes in neural circuitry only occur when the chemical milu of the brain is different than it normally is otherwise how would the brain know it should change so what sets the context for massive change in our neural circuitry is when there's a lot of adrenaline in the body sorry folks it's true adrenaline also called epinephrine and nor epinephrine released in the brain now you don't want to be in a state of panic or or stress to the point where you're debilitated but that shift in the chemical milu sets the stage for rewiring of connections between neurons I mean this is known at the molecular level it's known at the cellular level it's known at the circuit level and I'm excited to share that literature with you because it it just basically is a bunch of nerd speak um uh and numbers to support the fact that you're nailing it right in the Bull's Eye which is without frustration there is no rewiring of the neural circuits and if you think about it it had to be that way right otherwise why would the circuits change so that the error signal is what sets plasticity in motion now the actual rewiring occurs during sleep so this is my reminder to make sure that your kids get enough sleep because that's when the actual this is the phenomenon of not being able to do something coming back a few days or weeks later you're like can do it well because it happened in sleep the final portion of the rewiring it's why phone shouldn't be in the bedroom for kids I think 75% of people young between the age of seven and 18 are massively sleep deprived and you know there's the the neural rewiring deficits associated with that are are are serious and these are what we call sensitive periods uh I like sensitive periods more than critical periods because critical periods imply an open and shut sensitive is there's a tapering but it does taper yeah so um this unskilled to Skilled um and ation in the learning space model this is part of something that you're putting together now could you could you I already have it I mean our frustration tolerance program it's a workshop it's you know on our our it's within our membership right so it's one of you know it's one of 30 workshops to me it's one where you know the thing is no parents say Dr Becky what I'm really dealing with is low frustration tolerance you know they'll say I have you know my kid is having Tantrums or they won't do their homework or kids with ADHD tend to have low frustration tolerance right so um to me it's like one of the first things I recommend to new members where I say okay you might like this is the thing this is like the key thing that underlies a lot of Tantrums it underlies entitlement it underlies not sharing it underlies why you throw the board game when you're about to lose and underlies quitting it's not homework and again the MGI the most generous interpretation is wait right the commonality in all those situations is my kid is frustrated and if what they're learning or what they've practiced is when I feel frustrated it's so intense that sometimes I think like do our kids learn that their emotions operate on a dimmer switch or an onoff switch we want our kids to operate on a dimmer like you said if you're at a 10 out of 10 nothing you can't operate but if every time and I'm so interested in this literature you mentioned because I was thinking what would happen in the first number of years of a kid's life if every time they're frustrated well-intentioned but again just under resource parents turn it off then what I think would happen and I'm wondering is then something that could be like a five out of 10 I feel like would feel like a 10 out of 10 because you never had a dimmer right because if you only operated when a light went on with always going off then even if over time years later the light was at a five it's still going to feel blinding right and so this idea of a dimmer you want your kids when they're frustrated that's what frustration in tolerance is nobody says I'm frustrated I can't read yay no one says that but if it kind of comes up oh there's that light we want their bodies to think okay all I need to do and I have skills to get my nine out of 10 to an eight an eight to a seven when I'm at a seven that's where learning happens that's very different than it's at a nine and kind of like who's going to turn it off for me or the reason in those situations cuz say I'm not doing my homework is they don't have the skills to bring it to a seven and so their choice is to stay at a nine or 10 out of 10 which no human can do or walk away and bring it to a zero and so what I'm saying is our frustration tolerance Workshop which I want every parent to take but I also just want to get into schools um is literally the thing that helps you teach your kids how to get frustration TS how to you really can do this it sounds sick but like you can get your kids to like being in the learning space to be like like I I'm going to thrive here the Good Feeling is eventually going to come I'm relatively comfortable here because I I just have watched myself survive it that many times and so the benefits of that workshop and it just the program is not only Tantrums but actually is is a lot in academics CU that so many times when kids have issues in school I'm not ADHD is real dyslexia is real that definitely could be a component but so many times It's actually an issue of frustration tolerance and that's often not kind of labeled for parents I'm um realizing as you're saying this that the literature that I'm aware of about stress and Trauma is actually relevant here in an interesting and perhaps surprising way whereby you know this thing I said earlier you know the brain only changes under conditions where norepinephrine and epinephrine are released you know there is such a thing as one trial learning and it's associated with negative experiences and the reason negative experiences create such robust learning in only one trial is because there's a massive amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine and other neurochemicals released so it's stamped into the nervous system but learning of things we want to learn relies on the same neurochemicals I mean there's a wild and really cool literature from a guy named James mcau um who showed that like if you spike adrenaline before learning the learning is much faster and much more durable if you spike adrenaline after learning turns out the learning is more durable now we can't start getting into kind of uh you know biohacking experiments on on kids or themselves but that the adrenaline is supposed to come during the learning itself which is what you're saying but the problem is if we stop once we're frustrated we get the increase in Adrenaline and norepinephrine and again other neurochemicals as well but then the perception is that the the plasticity Loop is closed there so what did you learn when I do hard things I get frustrated when I stop the the frustration goes away yes that's all you learn in the same way that somebody exposed to trauma this underlies the basis of almost all modern trauma therapies is to in the right setting take people back through it sequentially let them experience that and start to desensitize to it so they can complete that Loop yeah that's exactly right and so I think it's so important to push through frustration and I think it's so important as you I'm just agreeing with you here clearly but that oftentimes that frustration can last more than just the learning session it can be weeks or months or in some cases a year of a really challenging course or a sports sports uh participation and so that's where it gets tough because as empathic creatures one hopes we hate to see members of our own species suffer especially our kids and so it becomes this thing of like do you let them opt out like what did they learn by opting out and that's where it gets really complicated cuz we got a forbrain which can set all these different rules and so um but can I I don't know about frustration for a year I guess I always think how we experience a feeling is the feeling plus the story We Tell ourselves about the feeling and the feeling kind of is at a certain level but the story we tell oursel about the feeling and what it means about us or how capable we are of coping with it that can make a feeling that was here go to here something about frustration of a year like I it's interesting we're talking so much about stories but again if one of the things I try as a parent is when my kid is saying I don't know what would it be to quit you know I I hate gymnastics right and you're thinking okay like first of all quitting is not always weak or wrong sometimes quitting is a very brave awesome great thing to do definitely sometimes the absolute best thing to do 100% but as a parent sometimes and I get this a lot like I'm conflicted like I don't know what's right first of all there's probably not a right and again our parenting never hangs on one decision so just let that go but I think what I would be curious to just experiment with again maybe it's because I'm so obsessed with frustration tolerance especially in this world that is so working against frustration tolerance I feel like it's like even my more my duty as a parent to help so I'm like okay let's just have an experiment where I would say okay talk to me about why you want to quit gymnastics and I'm might know in the back of my head maybe they're not as good as everyone anymore right or maybe they just don't like it who knows but I might say you know look maybe this isn't relevant I'm thinking about when I did you know I'm thinking about a different sport um when I did track growing up and there were like whole years where I was like I love track I love track and I don't know if I ever told you this but when I was 11 I hate a track I went from love to hate it and part of it was and again say something kind of relevant to your kid part of it was there was a new kid at school and like I was kind of the track star until she came in and then I was like second and that just kind of stunk and no I didn't tell myself it's okay I kind of told myself this stinks every day and part of it was all my friends were doing soccer and I kind of felt left out but I finished the year and the next year something interesting happened and this is what a kid will say I'll go oh what you love track again you know and it's this amazing moment because they're always going to say that to be like no no I ended up deciding that next year is my last year at track and I I stopped after that but can't explain it it just it felt like it came from like a different place it almost like I felt more settled I think after like I really knew and I don't know if that's relevant to gymnastics I do know you've loved it for a while it's kind of new to not like it and sometimes when something's new and you don't like it you just got to though but other times when something's new and you don't like it you want to like figure it out and I don't know I'm wondering if we should give it a few more weeks to try the figuring it out thing and again maybe your kid says no I want to quit and you're like fine and in some way have' already had the experience what no matter what they do but I think that's that's what I think about playing around with with kids way more than I think what parents say is so should they quit or not it's so binary it's so so rigid and I think we're missing the Nuance of the story and the process that matters more than the eventual decision I love your use of story in um narrative with your kids it seems like you use that a lot I do like instead of saying you know and uh forgive me for I'm not I'm not an analyst but I I feel like it starts with an observation like okay you're behaving this way maybe what's behind the behavior you're expressing this what's maybe deeper to that but um when talking about your own experiences towards your kids as you've been doing here in these pseudo hypotheticals I'm sure some of them is this we interview your kids later and find out no I'm kidding the um it's clear that you use story as a way to kind of um share genuinely but also probe for what might be going on with them and I have to say I find it um really delightful because it it it it raises lots of questions that I think anyone would have and I think it's um it's part of your gift clearly because um so many people you know follow your advice and and take but the advice you give is also it's interesting it's like an observation like frustration is key I want to increase frustration to tolerance but then you're not like okay you're going to hammer down their throats frustration tolerance in the following way it sort of becomes a a question like where is there frustration in your life and and then you put it into your own narrative as opposed to necessarily asking them questions I think asking kids questions or asking people questions generally is great like hey how can I do better as you pointed out earlier um but it's really I don't know if the word is disarming but it's really in a in a entirely positive way way like you use your own narrative to allow people start going oh yeah like where am I experiencing frustration where where could I tolerate that better and so I think that there's this incredible Triad of like or or tripartite thing of like observe consider like the deeper layer and then offering a narrative that's really a bunch of questions when where you're speaking from your real truth it's really elegant I have to say it's it's spectacular I hadn't realize it until right now I don't know if I realized those parts but you know what is is interesting is it brings up the word we kind of mentioned before but didn't talk about and maybe it'll be surprising that I say this is shame and I I think shame it is the biggest blocker to learning and shame I think can be defined like a lot of things in many ways but it's the experience of aloneness I think shame is the feeling you have when you kind of feel like a part of you is not attachable so for a kid that's an existential threat to not be in attachment with someone and in that way when you're not attachable you're alone you're alone and so so many of the things that happen with our kids because I'll I'll I'll model another story and maybe I'll get some flak for this because it's it's probably counterintuitive but I think about like one of my one of my kids my resilient Rebel who was in a hitting stage when he was younger hitting and he's just also in like a he was in like a couple weeks he was hitting and then and there was this one there was this one time where we were doing a family puzzle and he was younger he was probably like three it was really hard it was more for my older kids he was kind of doing his own thing I think he was playing with blocks on the side we leave we come back and like couple of the puzzle pieces were missing thing that we're in and I just knew I knew it he saw it I know most generous interpretation he felt like oh my God I can't participate what the rest of the family is doing and so you know what I'm going to do cuz I'm a smart kid I'm just going to stop them from participating and so I'm going to take the puzzle pieces and hide them I just I knew it I know him so we come back and we' worked really hard on this puzzle of course you're angry but again I can either do nothing on the outside or do nothing on the inside in that moment not always but chose to be an adult and I was just like I know you took the puzzle pieces I just want you know and he's like what are you talk no I didn't you know maybe his four no I didn't and I was like we're working on this puzzle I get that is probably frustrating but like you need I'm not I didn't have the puzzle pieces that was not working and then this is truly going back to stories and going back to shame if you feel like you're the bad kid who's doing bad things and you're the only one who's like that you are shut down from learning so I went up to him on the couch and my husband I remember watching me being like what are you doing and this is how I started I go I don't know if I can tell you this which any kids like I don't know if I can tell you this when I was probably about seven I did something really bad that's what I said and he was like I can't even tell you he was like he like every part of his anger like diffused and you can really draw a kid in by just saying to them I can't tell you I've never told anyone I go okay and this this is true I go my sister was two and she had these like oil stickers and I really wanted them and I asked my mom and she said no we couldn't go to the store no those are you know my sister's stickers and you're never going to guess what I did and he was like I don't know you asked her for them you waited you know and I was like no I took them but that's not the worst part he said what and I go my mom asked me if I took them I knew I did so you know what I told her and he said you told her yes and I go no I told her no and he literally goes and I I feel like in that moment what's happening is he's saying like so many things that you can never say didactically like Mom like you're my mom I love you I hold you on a pedestal and like even you did something that wasn't so great there's like so much hope and goodness and then I didn't in that moment I did not say and you cannot say in these situations so now you can tell me the you just have to like trust because I think the shame of the Badness shame freezes you right as an Animal Defense state right shame freezes you so a kid who's lying to you is always in shame and you can't get a kid to unfreeze and move to a different place of telling you the truth if you're adding more shame through fear like the math doesn't work but you can through stories now true story he did not right after that say you know I was just like I remember my husband who we okay with me saying this he was like we have to punish him we have you know we have to punish him I was like in the moment that's going to feel very cathartic to us that's what punishment does it makes you feel very powerful it makes you feel very cathartic it doesn't work it just doesn't especially not with kids who are strong willed I was like just give it a couple days it's probably a good three days later and he brought me the puzzle pieces in a bag and he just said I took them and he truly started crying and I did not lecture him I feel like the whole Arc the whole lesson Had basically already happened honestly like the day after or so again and this is what I think we miss as parents and like we're almost afraid to like just name the humanness of it and I kind of gave an example earlier he's going to want to do something bad again we all want to do bad things that's not a bad urge it's just about having the skills to do something differently when you have the urge so I think a couple days later and I do this I do these little like role plays they take like 20 seconds I was like oh my goodness look at the puzzle cuz we' still been working on it what if you want to take it again he goes I won't I go I know but I think you might want to remember how I took the oilies so you're acknowledging that inside him there might be a piece that still wants to do the wrong feelings and that's an urge I teach my kids an urge means you want to do something my kids will say an urge is not a behavior behavior is doing the thing that's not okay but the only reason your urge doesn't convert into behavior is because you have a skill to manage the urge and you can't build skills if no one teaches you them so I said what could you do instead could you run to me and say I really want to take the pieces could you say I need time with you because at the end of the day I think he felt left out and and we did and by the way this kid is he like perfect now no he you know but like it it brings together so many things when number one when we trust ourself that we have time when we realize shame the fear of being the only one being bad being unlovable being alone is often the biggest blocker for kids when you really realize that punishment and sending your kid away makes no sense at all and you can kind of give yourself freedom to tell stories right because when we're really struggling with something you don't want to look at someone especially someone who's perfect right it's like when you really have a bad experience as an adult the only thing you want to hear is your friend who I like you know I'm mortified I sent this email to my boss the only thing that would make me feel better is someone like let me show you the email I sent I'm like oh well that's worse that's the only thing that makes me feel better not because I wish bad upon other people but because you want to know you're not alone and other people's stories through that like vulnerability it's kind of like it's like this magic this magic trick I mean is pretty far away from the parenting um Dynamic but um the understanding and actual data from like 12 step programs and group therapy generally um including trauma therapy that is of a group therapy nature uh fully supports everything you said hearing the uh terrible or Andor humiliating things that people have done or have done to them as awful as that sounds you know is is often what underlies people's willingness to recover ability to recover and then they become the teachers over time like you said I think um you said so many incredible things there but right at the end you said something that I hope everyone internalizes that when you do something embarrassing maybe even humiliating the last thing you want to hear is look it's all going to be fine the thing that actually helps is somebody who has experienced something similar and is doing fine yeah and I use that at management all like we had someone do a presentation at work and it was for a bunch of people and it did not go well and I met with her and she knew it kind of didn't go well and honestly the only thing I said to her I don't even manage her directly she's more Junior and and I really mean this we had in Clinical Psychology grad school like it's intense you do a session when you're first doing sessions and like everyone's watching you they're like watching you do therapy which is helpful you know but I remember my first one and I felt like pretty okay about it I was like this my first one I was okay I I it I got I got torn to shreds they were like that was not good you know and now obviously I'm on the I feel good about my clinical abilities but the only thing I said to her is I was like look and and I shared it with her and I said like I've been there like eventually I look back on that helped me learn that day I just felt awful I wasn't like this is my learning space moment you know and so if you're you're feeling like that I just want to let you know like I've been there too this is the starting point to getting better this is going to like make you stronger I know that I've lived that and I I I think storytelling in that way is probably like a really underutilized kind of quote tool almost dehumanizes it to call it that in in management and in any relationship I love it and I feel like the story of your son bringing those puzzle pieces back is like ah there's so much there so much and the fact that there was a delay and then he he brought it back on his own accord and um and that you had already kind of Let It Go that that's I feel like a really interesting piece that it wasn't um to like appease you it was really something internal for him like he got the lesson for him it wasn't just about like making mom feel okay about him like he clearly understood you still love him but it wasn't about like fixing something externally as much as it was about fixing something internally which I think is the the addressing and overcoming the shame piece I think that's right and that's the thing like I think so many times like this like are we teaching kids what to think or how to think like after they're gone from our house like it's the how to think and you said questions I love kind of Socratic questions for kids like oh like if again a different version of a story would be like okay I know you didn't take the puzzle pieces but I'm just thinking for me like what would make me take puzzle pieces oh I wonder if I felt left out or I wonder if I was just really trying to get my parents' attention for a while and this is the only way to do it and what would I do after and what would I need now I'm going to get emotional what would I need to know about myself or from my parent for me to share that I did take it maybe I would need to know that my parents knew I was a good kid H anyway sorry what were we talking about like cuz your kids eventually make good decision adult make good decisions for themselves because they ask themselves the right questions that not because they've heard their parents specific lesson right because they're able to say to themselves like what am I feeling right now what am I really looking for why did I do that so like asking questions telling stories asking questions without even answering them actually provokes a much more sophisticated developmental process in your kid than the lectures we all me included trust me plenty of times that my kid that I've just lectured them but again they're just catharsis they're not actually terribly effective yeah um if ever there was some core truths about brain plasticity it's that frustration is associated with the chemicals that um Foster Brain Change we know that and that questions have a really interesting impact on learning which sounds kind of like a duh of course they do but when we ask questions it creates this open loop in the brain that the brain wants to solve as opposed to hearing a statement this why I always felt like those um pictures on office walls like motivation when you blah blah blah like the motivational statements don't mean much in terms of because they're not about verb States when we ask questions we put our brain into kind of a process of verb states of asking what behaviors are going to lead to which outcomes there's an interesting literature about this that um you know probably isn't fully relevant here but it gets back to trying to learn basic motor tasks and the same things are applied to basic cognitive tasks of like how do I solve this and puzzle is a great um example because it's both cognitive and motor like you're fixing these pieces in different ways I have to get back to doing some puzzles I'm realizing and emotional you know I can really embarrass myself but one of my favorite things that I again I've just noticed my kids extending for for puzzles because they all did a lot of puzzles when they were young is so funny I remember my kid doing like this puzzle and getting some frustration what I did is I did a puzzle to the side of him instead of doing it perfectly I kind of like mimicked I was like oh this doesn't fit oh it's not that piece okay and one of the things I noticed this one when my kid was really young is he kids have a really hard time with puzzles and it's kind of a metaphor for life for when a piece doesn't fit they keep trying it when what they really need to do is such a metaphor is put it down and pick up another piece right but I could tell my kid that but I'm not I always feel like just telling doesn't really work this is what I did not joking I'm going to sing get ready okay so I was doing it over here and I just go oh it's not fitting it's not fitting here it's not fitting here and I go if it doesn't fit put it to the side and try another piece and then I was like oh right I can put this on okay I'll get this one and I didn't make it for I was like oh oh oh that one fits there right I have heard not anymore kids are too old but there was a time I remember me and my husband were like outside the playroom and we heard our son like singing the song it's just it's a mantra it's self-regulation because is it cognitive is it physical it's also emotional it goes back to frustration tolerance where our kids need they need mantras they need skills they need songs to actually uplevel their skills to regulate the emotions that get in their way of doing great things right and you know that kid is interesting like not really anymore now that I think about I want to revive it he makes up songs Through situations what an amazing skill right but this stuff can like and if anyone's hearing this they like oh that's unrealistic like it's amazing you do it one time one time make up a silly song model the frustration yourself make up a song struggle again and then get success whatever it is it could be with reading with a puzzle with putting on your your sock it could be oh it doesn't fit I'm taking a deep breath and trying it again it could literally be anything cuz it adds a little play and jooy you probably know what song does in the brain better than I do but probably regulating um I would put money that a parents be like that's so weird Becky you're right it didn't take that much time I did it one time and my kids started singing the song and now they put their socks on by themselves I love it you taught a process through song and um there actually is a lot of data on music in the brain and how it organizes things mostly in the form of a story of a beginning middle and end and just the quickest example I can give is um when we learn our ABCs we learn them in song Right ABC you never forget that right um it's much easier to learn things through rhythmic song little motifs than it is um through a list of letters or numbers does our brain like encode it differ yeah so see it it fragments it into a beginning middle and end and then there's an under repetitive sort of wave a b c d e okay here I'm now I'm singing so you know at risk of of you know embarrassing both inducing all sorts of bad neural uh responses in listeners but uh you get the point it's it's it's a waveform that the brain can recognize I actually have a friend who's a very accomplished musician and I was say and I know the lyrics to his songs very well and I said you remember that song he goes well I have to hear the the underlying Melody and then he can remember all the words he's a singer he's a lead singer in a very very well-known band he doesn't even know the words to his own songs if you just ask them for him but you give him the music and he's just out the gate and he can do this in front of tens of thousands of people so then it is a cheat code for coping skills if you put it to song it it becomes a verb process sorry I didn't mean to cut you off there it's almost like saying like the mechanics of writing are you pick up you put the pen between you you know there's a um there's a whole Rhythm to writing there's a whole sequence of motor sequence that we that we learn or eating or anything for that matter um no one who's an expert piano player thinks about playing the individual keys at the point where they've learned it they've they've batched it into it's sort of like chunking but it has an underlying Rhythm that's carried by a neural circuit that allows the expression of the movements of the fingers or the or the the words out the mouth or in this case overcoming frustration to just kind of ride on top of all of it yeah so um there's an unconscious genius to to what you uh what you did and I love it maybe um as long as nobody hears me saying oh I'll need to sing more to get through frustration um I have a question about Miss Edson yes um people are going be like what um before we started recording you shared with us um something I think is entirely appropriate to what we're talking about now which is uh learning and learning hard things and frustration tolerance and you've evolved these Concepts you know in the course of your work and through your own parenting child relationships um clearly your own and then yours with your kids who was Miss Edson and what did she teach you because when you told me this I was like whoa that's super valuable we all need to know about this yes so miss Edson was my second grade teacher and I remember writing in her class and I remember something she told us and it's truly something that shapes me every day and she said if something feels too hard to start it just means that the first step isn't small enough and then she really kind of made this even more concrete because what I remember in her class writing and I still use this in writing today is okay so something feels too hard to do the implication is it doesn't mean it's my fault it doesn't mean I can't doesn't mean I'm stupid it literally just means the first step isn't small enough that's very actionable and so the way I play around with it now even in my own writing is okay I have to write a new article and I'm like I can't do that okay so I'm in I can't mode okay if something is in I can't mode if it feels too hard I hear her voice it just means the first step isn't small enough so I'll make it literally I'll just make it smaller I'm going to write a page today and then often I'm like I can't do that okay smaller a paragraph no and I literally do it until and some days it's a word and I go you know what I could write a word okay now okay right and I I really think Miss Edson was ahead of her time I mean obviously now we talk a lot about frustration tolerance growth mindset but this really is a way of saying when things are hard it's not your fault and there's something you can do to build the circuit of capability because I think when we're trying to do something hard there are like if you think about it I don't know you're on the top of a ski mountain and on the one side is that I can't it's too hard and the other side is I can we all have natural capability I I really believe this every person but it's just about figuring out how to get your skis like to the beginning of the ski slope and then maybe if we've practiced being on the I can't do hard things slope our skis keep trying to turn but we just have to keep getting them back and so if we tell ourselves I can't do this and we just stay there stagnant but if you say wait smaller smaller smaller smaller like I used this with the client a while ago I can't ask my boss for a raise I know I deserve cool no problem let's make it smaller okay what would be smaller I don't know let's get creative could you write down what you would say okay no could you say the word to me five times out loud raise raise raise raise raise I remember she laughed she go I can do that cool let's start there okay she literally did that what I think is so powerful about Miss edson's advice is as soon as we get even our skis a tiny bit into the I can circuit the I can slope we're actually just a lot more likely to stay there or at least that becomes a bigger part of our identity right so with this woman that I was working on this with one of the things we were working on it was just okay so you did that amazing the next thing I even just had her play around things saying to me can you say to me I deserve a raise it was very interesting she had I think this is one of the reasons she had trouble speaking up for it it was really hard for her to embody that we said that she couldn't I remember a week she said I'm going to write it down and bring it she didn't again like parenting I didn't punish her I didn't send her to her room I said Okay that was just too big let's make it smaller let's write it together we wrote some things down there right I then had her write it as an email and send it to me and I then had her practice it with her best friend and then she asked her boss for a raise like I mean like I don't even this like probably no one's surprised yeah like that makes sense she'd gone through a lot of steps but it's just applicable in every area of your life so even anyone listening we all have something in our I can't category this is too hard or I can't and we just stay there and if you if you hear Miss Edson saying wait if something feels too hard to do it only means that the first step isn't small enough and if then the next smallest step feels too hard no biggie like no judgment make it smaller make it smaller make it smaller and then allow yourself to eventually build up from there love it love Miss Edson I'm gonna thank you and Miss Edson yes thank you Miss Edson I I think the idea of lowering the stakes to be able to move forward is just spectacular yeah and in everything and um I noticed you do that by the way I'm not like analyzing I'm just saying you do that with with parenting I think there's so much tension around this notion of like creating healthy productive functional kids and I think there is a lot of Shame for parents that when things aren't going great and people know it or they know it and um the idea of creating lower Stakes um in order to be able to make pretty big moves over time where where they're required or just do nothing when sometimes that's what's required yeah and and that the similarity is so interesting what I think that the powerful thing about Miss edson's advice is is she's almost saying make something small enough so you can get your first win having a win is really powerful it's kind of Addicting you're like what's my next win right you're on the Wind circuit you know one of the reasons um we want to create so many more resources for parents and when parents come to us and even say this is a problem this is a problem this is a problem I often just start I I would say okay like what is the smallest thing would change that would make you when you go to bed at night be like today was a better day like there's some bigger stuff I hear you probably not going to tackle that we'll tackle that in time but like I want to get you a win today and then all of a sudden when a parent starts to build it's kind of their own self-efficacy their own like oh wait I did feel good about that one moment I did feel more connected to my kid I said this one thing it's it's I simp it's momentum you know and we have to give ourselves the opportunity to build momentum um which really usually only starts by by taking the smallest step anyway I think it's spectacular I um I was going to ask you uh and I never do this but I was going to ask you you know if there were one thing that people could start the process of trying to be a better parent better to themselves you know if it's more about you know more about emotional containment Etc um maybe it's this thing of you know asking you know at the end of today like what would be one thing that would allow me to have said it was a better day would that would that be it certainly that's powerful I'm going to give you two things one is kind of a one small thing but it's kind of a bigger theoretical thing and one thing is is very very very concrete um so the bigger thing I I really believe that the single biggest thing that gets in our way of feeling more empowered and capable as parents is that as much as we say we value parenting and I think parents people do who are parents are like yeah what do I care about more than parenting it's kind of the lowest on our list in terms of what we invest in you know people invest in all types of things and I want to be clear yes like we have an offering at good inside in our membership but that's not what I mean for someone listening they might be like there is that parent coach in my town who I've been like saying I'm going to call or maybe it's a therapist or maybe it's a parenting group at your school or maybe someone listens to me and they're like no offense Dr Becky there's someone else I follow on Instagram and they have a course and I like them better I I'd be like do that today like align your even purchasing decisions with your values like that that and because we're not expected to know this naturally we're not and as long as we don't have the resources around us a little kind of someone described it to me as like a onesie TWY thing like it it it's it's just not giving ourself what we deserve it is like a surgeon saying they're not good at surgery when you find out they never went to medical school or residency You' be like well just didn't really get resourced in the way you deserve for this very challenging job so that would really be the thing if I'm really honest because I'm not as much as I'm about a quick win I'm not about a quick fix I think that just sets us up for more like a Band-Aid having said that I love a quick thing so a couple things I think people can do with their kids telling your kid at night and I'll model how would say it like I think most people it's not just me when you put your kid to bed it's like oh you're like I just want to be on the couch but it's when your kid's willing to spend five extra minutes with you because it's the cruel irony at night you want time without your kids and they just want a little bit more time with you if you allow yourself to lean in and you can just say to your kid almost like in a whisper I think whispering to your kid is one of the most underutilized symbolist strategies whispers are so sacred they feel sacred they feel like they know they're just for you whispering to your kid like I just want to tell you there's nothing you could ever do that would make me stop loving you or I just want to tell you you're a really good kid we're in a hard stage but I will never ever ever think of you as anything but a really good kid don't expect your kid to say anything but just that takes 10 seconds and if you're like Whispering feels awkward don't whisper just say it like doesn't matter if you're thinking you don't know my kid they're teenager text them text them sometimes a text to a teen can feel like an unexpected whisper from a parent you know um and that's it and that and that's that's the single thing today and then maybe I'm going to add a third just do something like that for your yourself give yourself credit put your hand on your heart tell yourself it's parenting things really hard like I'm doing enough I'm not messing up my kid forever that's not a thing like and I've got this awesome well this whole thing that you've tempted to take on is also really hard and you're doing incredible work educating people on how to parent I there's so many things that you've said today I'm not going to recap them all um you know we do time stamps and all that so can people can find them but in no particular order I mean um you know this concept of you know telling a kid your right to notice when they when they notice something important in you or in others or in themselves um that rigidity is the enemy um asking like what's this really about when they're doing or saying something or expressing themselves in a way that feels confusing or maybe especially when it's irritating um encouraging frustration as a route to learning like incredible and then you said the more that you can locate somebody the more you respect their values which I think is incredible and on and on I mean there's just so many gems in today's conversation and and so many actionable gems that you provide on social media uh through your courses through conversations like this and others that you're holding in other podcasts and I just want to thank you so much uh you know I you're teaching people how to parent others how to think about their own parenting oh yes that's the other one you said the the only kind of parenting that we do reflexively is the one that was done for us which will evoke um you know feelings of relaxation in some people and feelings of dread in others and um but it all just speaks to the importance of paying attention to to this thing that we call parenting and I think the way that you're merging this with a thoughtful eye on technology where it's taking us and where there are concerns as well as you know where it can be utilized it's just fantastic I I can't say enough good things about the work that you're doing and I'm just so grateful that you're doing it and I'm saying that on behalf of myself and everyone else so you're you're making the world a better place so thank you so much for joining today and for for sharing so much uh we'll of course point out where people can find you but just keep going it's awesome I've learned

Title: How Exercise Increases Energy
Published: 2025-01-09 22:59:23 UTC
Description:
I discuss how exercise not only requires energy from proper sleep, hydration and nourishment but also generates energy by triggering the release of adrenaline and norepinephrine, which enhance both bodily and brain energy levels.

Transcript Language: English
If you've ever heard that exercise can give you energy, this is the basis of that statement, right? Many people, in fact, myself for many years thought, okay, I definitely have to sleep well in order to have energy and focus. That's absolutely true. Still true will always be true. I should maybe have some caffeine, be hydrated. You know, well-nourished, all this stuff in order to have the energy to exercise. But it's also true that exercise gives us energy, and this is how it gives us energy. When we move our body, the adrenals release adrenaline, and the adrenaline acts through two different, so-called, parallel pathways within the body, but again, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier. So then there's a series of what we call signaling relays or circuit relays up to the locus coeruleus, and then a sort of analog, it's different, but an analog to epinephrine. Norepinephrine is released within the brain, and lo and behold, we have elevated levels of both bodily energy and brain energy and focus that we can devote to that exercise, but also to the learning that comes after that exercise. So the next time you're feeling a little tired and you don't want to work out, remember exercise gives you energy through the pathways that I just described.

Title: Control Pain & Heal Faster With Your Brain | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2025-01-09 13:00:39 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to manage pain and accelerate injury recovery by leveraging protocols to modulate pain perception. 

I discuss how pain interpretation is a complex experience, shaped by both internal factors like emotions and genetics, as well as external factors, such as context. I explain how practical strategies like acupuncture, breathing techniques, exercise and temperature modulation can influence the body’s pain response and accelerate recovery. I also discuss topics like phantom limb pain, recovering from traumatic brain injury and the crucial role inflammation plays in the healing process. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

welcome to hubman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself in response to experience and even in ways that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it most people don't know how to access neuroplasticity and so that's what this entire month of the huberman Lab podcast has been about we've explored neuroplasticity from a variety of different perspectives we talked about representational plasticity we talked about the importance of focus and reward we talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect of the vestibular system how altering our relationship to gravity and in addition to that making error as we try and learn can open up Windows to plasticity but we have not really talked so much about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes and thus far we really haven't talked yet about how to undo things that we don't want and so today we are going to explore that aspect of neuroplasticity and we are going to do that in the context of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic which is pain and in some cases injury to the nervous system we as always here on this podcast are going to discuss some of the science we get into mechanism but we also really get at principles principles are far more important than any one experiment or one description of mechanism and certainly far more important than any one protocol because principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with it in ways that best serve you so let's start our discussion about pain and the somata sensory system the somata sensory system is as the name implies involved in understanding touch physical feeling on our body and the simplest way to think about the somata sensory system is that we have little sensors and Those sensors come in the form of neurons nerve cells that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin we have some that correspond to and we should say respond to Mechanical touch so you know pressure on the top of my hand or a pinpoint or other sensors for instance respond to heat to cold some respond to vibration we have a huge number of different receptors in our skin and they take that information and send it down these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord and then up to the brain and within the spinal cord andin brain we have centers that interpret that information that actually make sense of those electrical signals and this is amazing because none of those sensors has a different unique form of information that it uses it just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system pain and The Sensation of pain is Believe It or Not A controversial word in the Neuroscience field people prefer to use the word no acception noors are the sensors in the skin that detect particular types of stimuli it actually comes from the Latin word noera which means to harm and why would neurosci does not want to talk about pain well it's very subjective it has a a mental component and a physical component we cannot say that pain is simply an attempt to avoid physical harm to the body and here's why they actually can be dissociated from one another and there's a famous case that was published in the British Journal of Medicine where a construction worker I think he fell is how the story went and a 14inch nail went through his Boot and up through the boot and he was in excruciating pain just beyond anything he'd experienced he he reported that he couldn't even move in any Dimension even a tiny bit without feeling excruciating pain they brought him into the clinic into the hospital they were able to cut away the boot and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes and it had actually not imp impaled the skin at all his visual image of the nail going through his boot gave him the feeling the legitimate feeling that he was experiencing the pain of a nail going through his foot which is incredible because it speaks to the power of the Mind in this pain scenario and it also speaks to the power of the specificity it's not like he thought that his foot was on fire he thought because he saw a nail going through his foot what it was going through his boot but he thought it was going through his foot that it was sharp pain of the sort that a nail would produce it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these top down these you know higher level cognitive functions have in interpreting what we're experiencing out in the periphery even just on the basis of what we see so why are we talking about pain during a month on neuroplasticity Well turns out that the pain system offers a a number of different principles that we can leverage to a ensure that if we are ever injured we are able to understand the difference between injury and pain because there is a difference that if we're ever in pain that we can understand the difference between injury and pain that we will be able to interpret our pain and during the course of today's podcast I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain from both ends of the spectrum from the periphery at the level of the injury and through these top- down mental mechanisms believe it or not we're going to talk about love a colleague of mine at Stanford who runs a major pain clinic um is working on and has published quality peer- rreview data on the role of love in modulating the pain response so what we're talking about today is plasticity of perception which has direct bearing on emotional pain and has direct bearing on trauma so let's get started in thinking about what happens with pain and I will tell you just now that there is a mutation a genetic mutation in a particular sodium Channel a sodium channel is uh one of these little holes in neurons that allows them to fire Action potentials it's important to the function of the neuron it's also important for the development of certain neurons and there's a particular mutation there are kids that are born without this sodium Channel 1.7 if you want to look it up those kids experience no pain no pain whatsoever and it is a terrible situation um they don't tend to live very long due to accidents it's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance in fact it's reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons not all but one of the reasons why people might differ in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express people who make too much of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimul so let's talk about some of the features of how we're built physically and how that relates to pain and how we can recover from injury so first of all we have maps of our body surface in our brain it's called a homunculus that representation is scaled in a way that matches sensitivity so the areas of your body that are most sensitive have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them your back is an enormous piece of tissue compared to your finger finger tip but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it and the representation of your back in your brain is actually pretty small whereas the representation of your finger is enormous so the how big a brain area is devoted to a given body part is directly related to the density of receptors in that body part not the size of the body part you can actually know how sensitive a given body part is and how much brain area is devoted to it through what's called twoo discrimination you can do this experiment if you want I think I've described this once or twice before but basically if you have someone put um maybe take two pens and put them maybe 6 Ines apart on your back and and touch while you're facing away and you they'll ask you how many points they're touching you and you say um two but if they move those closer together say 3 in you're likely to experience it as one point of contact whereas on your finger you could do play that game all day and as long as there's a millimeter or so spacing you will know that it's two points as opposed to one and that's because there's more pixels more density of receptors this has direct bearing to pain because it says that areas of the body that have denser receptors are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others so just as a rule of thumb areas of your body that are injured that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury likely are going to experience less pain and the literature shows will heal more slowly because they don't have as many cells around to produce inflammation and you might say wait I thought inflammation is bad well one of the things I really want to get across today is that inflammation is not bad inflammation out of control is bad but inflammation is wonderful inflammation is the tissue repair response I thought it might be a nice time to just think about the relationship between the periphery and the central maps in a way that many of you have probably heard about before which will frame the discussion a little bit better which is Phantom limb pain now some of you are probably familiar with this but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger or some other portion of their body amputated it's not uncommon for those people to feel as if they still have that limb or appendage or piece of their body Inta and typically unfortunately the sensation of that limb is not one of the limb being nice and relaxed and and you know and just there the sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain or is contorted in the specific orientation that it was around the time of the injury so if someone has a you know a blunt force to the hand and they end up having their hand amputated typically they will continue to feel pain in their Phantom hand which is pretty wild and that's because the representation of that hand is still intact in the cortex in the brain and it's trying to balance its levels of activity normally it's getting what's called proprioceptive feedback proprioception is just our knowledge of where our limbs are in space it's an extremely important aspect of our somata sensory system and there's no appropri receptive feedback and so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up their levels of activity and they become very conscious of the Phantom limb now um before my lab was at Stanford I was at UC San Diego and one of my colleagues was a guy everyone just calls him by his lap last name ramachandran who is famous for understanding this Phantom limb phenomenon and developing a very simple but very powerful solution to it that speaks to the incredible capacity of top- down modulation and top- down modulation the ability to use one's brain cognition and senses to control pain in the body is something that everyone not just people missing limbs or in chronic pain could learn to benefit from because it is a way to tap into the our ability to use our mind to control perceptions of what's happening in our body so what did ramachandran do ramachandran had people who were missing a limb put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it such that when they looked in the box and they moved their intact limb the opposite limb which was a reflection of the intact limb because they're missing the opposite limb they would see it as if it was intact and as they would move their intact limb they would visualize with their eyes the the limb that's in the place of the absent limb so this is all by mirrors moving around and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom pain and he would tell them and they would direct their hand toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them then they would exit the mirror box they would take their their their hand out and and they would feel as if the hand was now in its relaxed normal position so you could get real time in moments remapping of the representation of the hand now that's amazing this is the kind of thing that all of us would like to be able to do if we are in pain because if you do anything for long enough including live you're going to experience pain of some sort and this again I just want to remind you isn't just about physical injuries and pain this has direct relevance to emotional pain as well which we of course we'll talk talk about so the ramachandran studies were really profound because they said a couple of things one plasticity can be very fast that it can be driven by the experience of something just the visual experience and so this may come as a shock to some of you and by no means it might trying to be insensitive but pain is a perceptual thing as much as it's a physical thing it's a belief system about what you're experiencing in your body and that has important relevance for healing different types of injury and the pain associated with that injury now this brings up another topic which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury but is a more General one that I hear about a lot which is traumatic brain injury many injuries are not just about the limb and the the lack of use of the limb but concussion and head injury but I want to talk a little bit about what is known about recovery from concussion and this is very important because it has implications for just normal aging as well and offset setting some of the cognitive decline and physical decline that occurs with normal aging typically after TBI there's a constellation of symptoms that many people if not all people with TBI report which is headache photophobia that lights become kind of aversive sleep disruption trouble concentrating sometimes mood issues there's you know a huge range and of course the severity will vary Etc it's very clear that regardless of whether or not there was a skull break and regardless of when the TBI happened and how many times it's happened that the system that repairs the brain the adult brain is mainly centered around this lymphatic system that we call for the brain the glymphatic system it's sort of like a sewer system that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons especially injured neurons and the glymphatic system is very active during sleep and the glymphatic system is something that you want very active because it's going to clear away the debris that sits between the neurons and the cells that surround the connections between the neurons called the glea those cells are actively involved in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged so the glymphatic system is so important that many people if not all people who get TBI are told get adequate rest you need to sleep and that's kind of twofold advice on the one hand it's telling you to get sleep because all the good things happen in sleep it's also about getting those people to not continue to engage in their activity fulltime or really try and Hammer through it the glymphatic system has been shown to be activated further in two ways one is that sleeping on one side not on back or stomach seems to increase the amount of wash out or wash through I should say of the glymphatic system the other thing that has been shown to improve the function of the lymphatic system is a certain form of exercise and I want to be very very clear here I will never and I am not suggesting that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury or that goes against their Physician's advice however there's some interesting data that zone 2 cardio for 30 to 45 minutes three times a week seems to improve the rates of clearance of some of the debris after injury and in general injury or no to accelerate and improve the rates of flow for the lymphatic system it could be fast walking it could be jogging if you can do that with your injury safely could be cycling and this is really interesting outside of TBI because what we know from aging is that aging is a nonlinear process it's not like with every year of Life your brain gets a little older it's a has sometimes it follows what's more like a step function you get these big jumps in in a in markers of Aging I guess that we could think of them as jumps down because it's a negative thing for most everybody would like to live longer and be healthier in brain and body and so the types of exercise I'm referring to now are really more about brain longevity and about keeping the brain healthy than they are about physical fitness so I think this is really interesting and if some of you would like to know the mechanism or at least the hypothesize mechanism ISM there's a a a molecule called aquaporin 4 that is related to the gal system so Gia are the it means glue and Latin are these are these cells in the brain the most numerous cells in the brain in fact that in sheath synapses but they're very Dynamic cells aquaporin 4 is mainly expressed by the gal cell called the astroy Astro looks like a little star incredibly interesting cells and the the thing to remember is that the asites bridge the connection between the neurons the synapse the connections between them and the vasculature the blood system and the gimatic system so this glymphatic system and the gal asroy system is a system that we want chronically active throughout the day as much as possible so low-level walking Zone 2 cardio and then at night during slow wave sleep is then really when this lymphatic system kicks in so that should hopefully be an actionable takeaway provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely that I believe everybody should be doing who cares about brain longevity not just people who are trying to get over TBI now I'd like to return a little bit to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation because I think it's so interesting and so actionable that everyone should know about this our interpretation our subjective interpretation of a sensory event is immensely powerful for dictating our experience of the event the molecule adrenaline when it's liberated into our body truly blunts our experience of pain we all know the stories of people you know walking you know miles on stumped legs um people doing all sorts of things that were incredible Feats that allowed them to move through what would otherwise be pain and afterward they do experience extreme pain but during the event often times they are not experiencing pain and that's because of the pain blunting effects of adrenaline adrenaline binding to particular receptors actually shuts down pain Pathways people who anticipate an injection of morphine immediately report the feeling of loss of pain their pain starts to diminish because they know they're going to get pain relief and it's a powerful effect now all of you are probably saying placebo effect Placebo effects are very real Placebo effects and belief effects as they're called have a profound effect on our experience of noxious stimul like pain and they can also have a profound effect on positive stimuli and things that we're looking forward to one study that I think is particularly interesting here from my colleague at Stanford Sean Mackey they did a neuroimaging study they subjected people to pain in this case it was a a heat pain people have very specific thresholds to heat at which they cannot tolerate any more heat but they explored the extent to which looking at an image of somebody in this case a romantic partner that the person loved would allow them to adjust their pain response and it turns out it does they could tolerate more pain and they reported it as not as painful that response that feeling of Love internally can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree these are not small effects and not surprisingly how early a relationship is how new a relationship is directly correlat with people's ability they showed to use this love this internal representation of love to blunt the pain response so for those of you that have been with your partners for many years and you love them very much and you're obsessed with them terrific you have a pre-installed well I suppose it's not pre-installed you had to do the work because relationships are work but you've got a installed mechanism for blunting pain and again these are not minor effects these are major effects and it's all going to be through that top down modulation that we talked about not unlike the mirrorbox experiments with Phantom limb that relieve phantom pain or some other top- down modulation in the opposite example is the nail through the boot which is a visual image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was painful even though there was no tissue damage it was all perceptual so the pain system is really subject to these perceptual influences which is remarkable because really when we think about the somata sensory system it has this cognitive component it's got this peripheral component but there's another component which is the way in which our sensation our somatos sensory system is woven in with our autonomic nervous system independent of love we're going to talk about something quite different which is putting needles and electricity in different parts of the body so-called acupuncture something that for many people were it it's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine but now there are excellent Laboratories exploring what's called electroacupuncture and acupuncture and I think what you'll be interested in and surprised to learn is that it does work but sometimes it can exacerbate pain and sometimes it can relieve pain and it all does that through very discrete Pathways for which we can really say this neuron connects to that neuron connects to the adrenals and we can tie this all back to dopamine because in the end it's the chemicals and neural circuits that are giving rise to these perceptions or these experiences rather of things that we call pain love ET Etc there are actually a lot of really good peer-reviewed studies supporting the use of acupuncture for in particular GI trct issues in recent years there's been an emphasis on trying to understand the mechanism of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself but as a way to try and understand how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system or brain body relationship in general what I want to talk about in terms of acup puncture is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates the cross talk between the somata sensory system our ability to feel stuff externally exteroception internally interoception and how that somata sensory system is wired in with and communicating with our autonomic nervous system that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness so this takes us all back to the homunculus we have this representation of our body surface in our brain that representation is what we call somatotopic and what somatotopy is is it just means that areas of your body that are near one another are represented by neurons that are nearby each other in the brain the connections from those brain neurons are sent into the body and they are synchronized with meaning they Crosswire with and and form synapses with some of the input from the viscera from our guts from our diaphragm from our stomach from our spleen from our heart our internal organs are sending information up to this map in our brain of the body surface but it's about internal information what we call interoception our ability to look inside or imagine inside and feel what we're feeling inside so the way to think about this accurately is that our representation of our self is a represent ation of our internal workings our viscera our guts everything inside our skin and the surface of our skin and the external World those three things are always being combined in a very interesting complex but very seamless way acupuncture involves taking needles and sometimes electricity Andor heat as well and stimulating particular locations on the body and if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue like their their guts are moving too quick they have diarrhea you stimulate this area and it'll slow their gut motility down or if their gut motility is too slow they're constipated you stimulate someplace else and it accelerates it and you know hearing about this of it sounds kind of to a Westerner who's not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry it could sound kind of wacky but when you look at the neural circuitry the neuro Anatomy it really starts to make sense intense stimulation of the abdomen however with these electroacupuncture has a very strong effect of an increasing inflammation in the body body and this is important to understand because it's not just that stimulating the the gut does this because you're activating the gut area it activates a particular nerve pathway for the afficionados it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis if you really want to know and it's pro-inflammatory under most conditions if for instance the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection that can be beneficial and this goes back to a much earlier discussion that we had on a previous podcast that we'll revisit again and again which is that the stress response was designed to combat infection so it turns out that there are certain patterns of stimulation on the abdomen that can actually liberate immune cells from our immune organs like our spleen and counter infection when you stimulate these Pathways that activate in particular the adrenals the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine and the brain does as well it binds to what are called the beta noradrenergic receptor okay so this is really getting kind of down into the weeds but the beta nuragic receptors activate the spleen which liberate cells that combat infection that's the short-term quick response the more intense stimulation of the abdomen and other areas can be pro-inflammatory because of the ways that they trigger certain Loops that go back to the brain and Trigger the sort of anxiety Pathways that exacerbates pain so one pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts PL the other one doesn't what does all this mean how are we supposed to put all this together well there's a paper that was published in nature medicine in 2014 this is an excellent Journal that describes how dopamine can activate the Vegas peripherally and nor norepinephrine can activate the Vegas peripherally and reduce inflammation what this means is that there are real maps of our body surface that when stimulated communicate with our autonomic nervous system the system system that controls alertness or calmness and thereby releases either molecules like norepinephrine and dopamine which make us more alert and blunt our response to pain and they reduce inflammation but there are yet other Pathways that when stimulated are pro-inflammatory one of the things that bothers me so much these days and I'm not easily irritated but what really bothers me is when people are talking about inflammation like inflammation is bad inflammation is terrific inflammation is the reason why cells are called to the site of injury to clear it out inflammation is what's going to allow you to heal from any injury chronic inflammation is bad but acute inflammation is absolutely essential remember those kids that we talked about earlier that have mutations in these receptors that for sensing pain they never get inflammation and that's why their joints literally disintegrate it's really horrible because they don't actually have the inflammation response because it was never triggered by the pain response so I think that the data on acupuncture turning out to be very interesting before I continue I just thought I'd answer a question that I get a lot uh which is what about Wim Hoff breathing Wim Hoff also called AKA The Iceman um has his breathing that's similar to uh Tumo breathing as it was originally called involves basically hyperventilating and then doing some exhales and some breath holds a number of people have asked me about it in uh in relation to pain management the effect of doing that kind of breathing it's not a mysterious effect it liberates adrenaline from the adrenals when you have adrenaline in your system and when the spleen is very active that response is used to counter infection and stress counters infection by liberating killer cells in the body you don't want the stress response to stay on indefinitely however things like Wim Hoff breathing like ice baz anything that releases adrenaline will counter the infection but you want to regulate the duration of that adrenaline response today we've talked about a variety of tools but I want to Center in on a particular sequence of tools that hopefully you won't need but presumably if you're a human being and you're active you will need at some point it's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast or at least as fast as possible it includes removing the pain it includes getting Mobility back and getting back to a normal life whatever that means for you I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about next was developed in close consultation with Kelly starett who many of you probably have heard of before Kelly can be found at the ready State he's a formally trained so degreed and educated exercise physiologist he's a world expert in movement and tissue Rehabilitation so I asked Kelly I made it really simple I said okay let's say I were to sprain my ankle or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear or something like that or shoulder injury what are the absolute necessary things to do regardless of situation so the first one is a very basic one that now you have a lot of information to act on which is sleep is essential and so we both agreed 8 hours of sleep would be ideal but if not at least 8 hours inmobile so that's a non-negotiable in terms of getting the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance and tissue clearance Etc the other is if possible unless it's absolutely excruciating when you just can't do it a 10-minute walk per day of course you don't want to exacerbate the injury at least a 10-minute walk per day and probably longer this is where it gets interesting I was taught I learned that when you injure yourself you're supposed to ice something you're supposed to put ice on it but I didn't realize this but when speaking to exercise physiologists and some Physicians they said that the ice is really more of a placebo it numbs the the environment of the injury which is not surprising and will eliminate the pain for a short while but it has some negative effects that perhaps offset its use it actually can create some like clotting and sludging of the of the tissue and fluids which is bad because you want the macras and the other cell types phagocytosing eating up the debris and and injury and moving it out of there so that it can repair so that was surprising to me which made me ask well then what about heat well it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial the major effects seem to be explained by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the profusion of of fluid blood lymph and other fluids out of the injury area so all of this might sound just like Common Sense knowledge I always just thought it's ice it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs it's things that block block prostag gland and so things like aspirin ibuprofen acetam Menin those things generally work by blocking things like the the they're called Co the Cox uh prostag gland in blockers and things of that sort things in that pathway those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation may not be so great at the beginning when you want inflammation they may be important for limiting pain so people can be functional at all but the things that I talked about today really are anchored in three principles one is that the inflammation response is a good one it calls to the to the sight of injury things that are going to clean up the injury in bad cells then there are going to be things that are going to improve profusion like the glymphatic system getting deep sleep feet elevated sleeping on one side low-level Zone 2 cardio three times a week many people ask me about platelet rich plasma so-called PRP they take blood they enrich for platelets and they re-inject it back into people here's the deal it has never been shown whether or not the injection itself is what's actually creating the effect the claims that PRP actually contains stem cells are very very feeble and when you look at the literature and you talk to anyone expert in the stem cell field they will tell you that it's the number of stem cells in PRP is infinim small stem cells are an exciting area of Technology however there's a clinic down in Florida that was shut down a couple years ago for injecting stem cells harvested from patients into the eye for immaculate degener ation these were people that were suffering from um poor vision and very shortly after injecting uh these stem cells into the eyes they went completely blind and I'm not here to tell you that you should or shouldn't do something but I do think that anything involving stem cells one should be very cautious of the major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning is that stem cells are cells that want to become lots of different things not just the tissue that you're interested in so if you damage your knee and you you inject stem cells into your knee you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells so that they don't become tumor cells right a tumor is a collection of stem cells one needs to approach this with Extreme Caution even if it's your own blood or stem cells that you're re-injecting so I'm going to close there I've talked about a lot of tools today I've talked a lot about somea sensation about plasticity about pain about acupuncture some of the Nuance of acupuncture inflammation stress we even talked a little bit about high-intensity breathing so as always we take kind of a whirlwind tour through a given topic lay down some tools as we go hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury but also neuroplasticity in general today in the context of the somata sensory system will be of use to all of you I don't wish injury on any of you but I do hope that you'll take the information do with it what you will once again thanks so much for your time and attention today and as always thank you for your interest in science [Music]

Title: Tools for Increasing Motivation
Published: 2025-01-08 15:15:00 UTC
Description:
The closer people get to a finish line, the harder they will work to cross it. That phenomenon can be leveraged in what is called the “Illusion of Proximity” to create more effort (with less perceived effort!) and a higher likelihood of success. 

Dr. Emily Balcetis, professor of psychology at New York University explains.

Transcript Language: English
- The closer you get to the goal, generally the harder people and animals work to finish that goal. That's what led us then to think, "Okay, those rats, those mice, those people are seeing a finish line, right?" And it's when their maybe seeing that finish line, seeing that reward, seeing the goal they're hoping to accomplish that is what's leading them to try harder, to invest more, so that they can finish it off. What if we induce that illusion of proximity? What if we can induce a visual illusion, a visual experience that approximates what the real rats and mice were actually experiencing as they got closer? That is what is happening. That's what's happening visually when we create that narrowed focus of attention when we tell people, "Imagine there's a spotlight on the shorts of the person up ahead or the stop sign that you're seeing." It induces an illusion of proximity that then is responsible for people trying harder. Walking faster, feeling that it defied their expectations and that it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be.

Title: Should You Exercise After a Poor Night’s Sleep?
Published: 2025-01-07 19:20:37 UTC
Description:
I explain how exercising after a poor night’s sleep can help and share tips to do it safely.

Transcript Language: English
One question I get a lot is, let's say I don't sleep that well. Should I exercise? Well, the short answer is yes, provided that it was just one night of poor sleep. It turns out that exercising after a poor night's sleep can help offset some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation on what? On brain performance and health. Now, you don't want to get into a habit of this. You don't want to get into a habit of using exercise as a way to compensate for sleep loss. So if you don't sleep well for one night, exercise is a great way to offset that sleep loss effect on the brain or that would otherwise affect the brain. You can compensate for it by doing some exercise. Keep in mind, you want to exercise in a way that's not too intense because you can drive your immune system down and be more vulnerable to infections. That's certainly the case after a poor night's sleep. You also want to be really careful with what you do for that exercise in terms of your coordinated movement. It's much easier to get injured when you're sleep deprived. In fact, there's a really nice set of studies. Layne Norton's talked about this elsewhere, that the relationship between sleep, or I should say sleep deprivation and injury is a strong one, and the relationship between sleep loss and pain and failure to recover from injury is also a strong one. The direct point being, if you're slightly sleep deprived, sure, go ahead and exercise. That will actually help you offset some of the negative effects of that sleep deprivation, but you want to be careful how you exercise so you don't get sick and you don't get injured.

Title: How to Use Exercise to Improve Your Brain’s Health, Longevity & Performance
Published: 2025-01-06 13:00:32 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss how different forms of exercise impact brain health and performance in both the short and long term. I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.

I also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.

The positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing exercise and brain health which includes brain longevity and brain performance our ability to learn new information over long periods of time and indeed into old age today we are going to discuss how different forms of exercise resistance training cardiovascular training of both long medium and short duration can be used to improve the way that your brain functions acutely meaning immediately in the minutes and hours and the day that you do that exercise as well as in the long term in the days weeks and months after you perform that exercise and of course if you're exercising regularly the effects of exercise on brain health and performance compound over time making you better able to learn things are able to retain information from the past and indeed to expand your brain's capacity to learn new types of information in new ways in researching today's episode I quickly came to realize that the number of studies that have explored the relationship between exercise brain performance and brain health as well as the range of different types of exercise that have been explored in that context is extremely vast there are literally tens of thousands of studies on this topic as well as metaanalyses and reviews all of which point to positive effects of Doing exercise of various types on brain health and performance within those many many studies you'll find many many different exercise protocols that lead to improvements in brain performance and Longevity so the goal of today's episode is to synthesize that vast amount of information into a logical framework that simplifies it and clarifies it and places it within the context of specific mechanisms both neurobiological mechanisms and endocrine based mechanisms that together can very well explain the data on how exercise impacts brain Health and Longevity such that by the end of today's episode you'll have both some specific recommendations about how to use exercise for sake of brain health and performance that I believe will be new to most of you as well as the ability to think about the mechanisms and The Logical framework that wraps around this incredibly large literature on exercise and brain performance so that you can customize your exercise program on the basis of how much time you have available your specific age your health status and the specific types of brain changes that you might be seeking through the use of exercise and I should also say that by learning how exercise impacts brain performance and brain health you're also going to learn some of the incredible ways that your body communicates with your brain and your brain communicates with your body not just during exercise but all of the time so today you're going to learn a lot of practical tools of course about exercise brain Health and Longevity it's based on Research that is incredibly interesting in in some cases surprising and in almost all cases actionable as some of you may already know I have a book coming out this year 2025 entitled protocols an operating manual for the human body I'm super excited about the book it includes protocols that is actionable steps that anyone can take to improve their sleep motivation creativity gut microbiome nutrition exercise stress modulation and much more now the book was originally scheduled to be released in April of 2025 however to make sure that the book reflects the latest scientific research I've decided to expand on the yes already finished version of the book to make sure that the protocols are as upto-date as possible and reflect the most modern and best findings so the new release date for protocols is going to be September of 2025 I do apologize for the delay in release but I assure you that I will make it worth your wait to learn more about the book or to secure a copy by pre-sale go to protocols book.com there you'll find all the information about the book and as well as the various languages that the book will be translated into before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online now I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years years therapy is an extremely important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about any and all issues that concern you second of all great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support but also directed Guidance the dos and the not todos and third expert therapy can help you arrive at useful insights that you would not have arrived at otherwise insights that allow you to do better not just in your emotional life in your relationship life but also the relationship to yourself and your professional life and all sorts of career goals with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you can really resonate with and provide you with these three benefits that I described also because better help is carried out entirely online it's very time efficient and easy to fit into a busy schedule with no commuting to a therapist office or sitting in a waiting room or looking for a parking spot so if you'd like to try better help go to betterhelp / huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft that mattress is or or How firm it is how breathable it is all play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs so if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz that asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress the US I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about 3 and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever ever had so much so that when I travel to hotels and airbnbs I find I don't sleep as well I can't wait to get back to my dusk mattress so if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's customized for your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get up to 25% off okay let's talk about the relationship between exercise brain Health and Longevity and performance let's just take a couple of minutes and really clearly Define what we mean by exercise because most of us have a concept of what exercise is but for sake of understanding the relationship between exercise and brain performance most of the peer-reviewed studies focus on two general categories of exercise either cardiovascular exercise or resistance training now of course cardiovascular exercise can be a very short duration high intensity so getting heart rates up way way way up or longer duration lower int intensity now typically the amount of time scales with that so the shorter intensity stuff tends to be quick bouts of either 30 second 60c sometimes 2 minute or even 4 minute allout effort with some period of rest afterwards or longer duration 20 30 45 or even 60 Minutes of cardiovascular training at a more steady state lower intensity and I should mention that within the tens of thousands of studies that are out there exploring the relationship between exercise and brain Health and Longevity you will mostly see studies focused on cardiovascular exercise and most of those studies early on were focused on the longer duration lower intensity stuff so typically 30 to 60 Minutes of lower intensity yet still elevating the heart rate exercise nowadays there's more of a focus on the high-intensity interval training and today we're even going to hear about some studies that involve very very short bursts so-called Sprints of activity as short as 6 seconds long followed by a period of rest repeat did for a number of times and exploring what the effect of that sort of I should say very very short intensity exercise is on immediate and long-term brain health and performance okay so cardiovascular training of different durations and intensities involving different durations of rest are one category that we're going to talk about today the other category of exercise we're going to talk about today is resistance training now most of the studies involving resistance training and their effects on the brain both brain longevity and brain performance focus on either compound so multi-joint movement so think squats deadlifts bench press shoulder press dips Etc but very often and this is just a byproduct of how studies are done in the laboratory very often the exploration of the relationship between resistance training and brain Health and Longevity are single joint isolation exercises like a single leg leg extension even you might be thinking wait just one leg doing the leg extension yes the reason for that and I spoke to some of the scientists that do this sort of work is that when they have subjects do a say seated single leg leg extension as the form of resistance training I know I and some of you are probably chuckling like really of all the things you could select to see if it impacts brain health you're going to have people kick up one knee yep you do that why well most people can do that type of movement it doesn't take any training or it just takes a little bit of direction as to how to do it so it can be done reasonably safely by many people including people that are non-athletes often older than 65 years old not that there aren't some very fit 65y olds but just people who are older than 65 but don't have a lot of athletic background can sit down in a chair put the pin at the appropriate weight and move their knee or rather Elevate their foot while seated in a chair so-called single leg leg extension and also it gives the benefit of the opposite leg within subject control for comparison in terms of strength increases okay so set aside any kind of you know like eye rolls or Chuckles that you might have about single leg leg extensions as the total form of resistance training that's being explored because yes those studies are still informative in fact they perhaps even identifi the lower threshold for the amount of resistance training and type of resistance training that could benefit the brain but we also see studies that involve compound exercises so having people do free weight squats or even weighted squats or deadlifts or you know bench press dip deadlift type combinations again when you look at the literature exploring exercise and brain health you're looking at studies that in the best cases are very tightly controlled that typically means having people do them in the laboratory in a very specific way sometimes using untrained subjects meaning when the subjects arrive at the study they haven't done much exercise of that sort sometimes it's involving trained subjects both have their caveats of course but keep in mind that during today's discussion I'm going to be pooling at many times across all these studies exploring cardiovascular exercise of different duration and intensities resistance training of different types and sometimes different intensities as well but where there is a specific piece of knowledge that can be gleaned from understanding the exact type of exercise that was done and a specific type of Brain Change especially in cases where it's been shown to be especially beneficial I will be sure to highlight that so as we proceed in today's discussion keep in mind exercises many things two general categories most of the studies focus on high-intensity or low intensity cardio most of the studies involve either single joint isolation exercises sometimes even single joint single leg isolation exercises or compound exercises and keep in mind that most of the studies exploring the relationship between exercise and brain health and performance are done to explore two types of changes either what are called acute changes meaning immediate changes so they have people do the exercise and then they have them take a cognitive test or some other form of test that analyzes brain health and performance or they look at chronic effects which are what are the changes in brain performance and health over long periods of time meaning having people do a particular type of exercise anywhere from two to four times per week although typically it's three times per week and doing that for anywhere from 4 weeks to 6 months again all of this relates to the Practical aspects of running controlled studies in the laboratory so if by now you're thinking this is really complicated how is it that we're supposed to teach out the best things to do given this huge ball of barbed wire of different types of studies variables Etc well I assure you we are going to make this very clear and very actionable and the thing to keep in mind is that fortunately most all of the studies yes most all of the studies that have explored the relationship between exercise brain Health and Longevity and performance find positive effects now for some of you who are Skeptics you might be thinking well great so you can do any form of exercise well in some sense yes I'll actually tell you this right off the bat there are good data showing that if people do sixc Sprints Max allout sprints on a stationary bicycle followed by one minute rest and repeat that six times you see significant acute effects on brain performance so the brain performance could be a memory task sometimes it is a memory task it could be what's called a Stroop task which is a cognitive flexibility task where you have to distinguish between the colors that words are written in and the content of the words okay so-called Stroop task I've talked about this on previous podcast I'll talk about it a little bit more later regardless of the cognitive test that's used that very short duration high-intensity training increases performance significantly as well 20 or 30 minutes of so-called steady state cardio you know figuring out how fast you can run or row or swim or stationary bike for 20 to 30 minutes at a steady state and then you analyze people's cognitive performance on a memory task can be a working memory task so remembering a short string of numbers or it could be math problems it could be the Stroop task any number of different tasks reveal the same thing which is that the longer duration lower intensity cardio also significantly improves performance now does that mean that you can do six rounds of six seconds of sprinting with a minute in between or 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise and get the same effect on brain performance well if you're just looking at overall improvements in performance so for instance the the percentage of information that you learn if you do or you don't do the exercise or if you compare those two forms of exercise that I just mentioned in that sense yes it really doesn't make a difference which may have you scratching your head but in a few moments I'll explain why that is on the other hand different forms of exercise of course impact our bodily Health differently higher intensity shorter duration exercise of course impacts things like V2 Max and which circulating hormones and neuromodulators are going to be present very differently than longer duration lower intensity EX exercise so too if you have people do single joint isolation resistance training exercises like a single leg leg extension or both legs leg extension versus 10 sets of 10 in a squat exercise you're going to see very different specific adaptations at the physical level at the bodily level but in every case where you explore the acute the immediate changes that occur in brain output and function after people do that sort of exercise you're going to see significant increases when one does physical exercise short duration high-intensity cardio or higher intensity resistance training single joint training compound training single joint isolation exercises compound exercises one sees these increases in brain performance at least acutely in the immediate stage after the training so we have to ask ourselves why is it how is it that all these different forms of exercise are positively impacting brain performance and the answer is very simple and fortunately gives us tremendous leverage over our exercise and how to impact our brain health and the answer is arousal however the answer isn't entirely arousal meaning not all of the positive effects of exercise on brain health longevity and performance can be explained by arousal but when I step back from the literature again an enormous literature tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers many of which are done exceptionally well by the way as well as meta analyses and reviews I think it's fair to say that probably 60 to 70% of the effects of exercise on brain health performance and Longevity can be explained by the specific shifts in our physiology both bodily physiology and directly within the brain's physiology during those bouts of exercise which is this increase in so-called autonomic arousal which occurs during the exercise but also extends into a window after the exercise is completed so we have to talk about this relationship between exercise arousal and acute brain performance meaning the improvements in brain performance that happen immediately after the exercise and then we'll shift our Focus to the effects of exercise that occur more chronically that is the effects of exercise on brain health and performance that occur in the hours days weeks and years after we exercise even if we are continuing to exercise every day or three times a week or whatever the frequency might be but this issue of arousing is extremely important and I assure you it's not trivial in fact it will help you understand a number of things in the domains of deliberate cold exposure stress trauma and most importantly for today's discussion it will help you design an exercise program that's geared towards giving you the maximum bodily health effects and the maximum brain health effects okay in order to understand the relationship between exercise arousal and learning we have to really clarify the relationship between arousal and learning that's going to set the stage for pretty much everything else we're going to talk about for the next 10 minutes or so and it's oh so cool it also gives me the opportunity to review a paper that I've long loved which comes from Larry kahill's group down at UC Irvine entitled enhanced memory consolidation with post-learning stress interaction with the degree of arousal at encoding this is just one of several papers from the kill Group which essentially identified the following there are a couple of different ways you can increase so-called autonomic arousal or levels of alertness sometimes it's called stress but autonomic arousal is simply an increase in the amount of activity in the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is nerds speak for more alert more aroused wide-eyed ready to move higher heart rate higher blood pressure more alertness this is a great state to be in for learning material provided it's not too much alertness too much arousal turns out this paper shows it's also a great state to be in after you've been exposed to material that you want to learn and it's also the case that in this paper and in many many other papers from this and other Laboratories that you can increase levels of autonomic arousal by having people put their arm into ice water for 1 to three minutes the so-called cold pressure test it's a very commonly used standard test this paper and many other papers show that it leads to very rapid and significant increases in circulating levels of cortisol which yes sometimes it's called a stress hormone but it's really just a hormone involved in the stress response but does a bunch of other things too so they use that as a tool after people have been exposed to certain types of information to ask does elevation in cortisol AKA autonomic arousal improve one's ability to remember information and the answer is yes this study shows that several other studies from the kill and other laboratory show that sometimes those studies use people putting their arm into ice cold water other times they'll inject them with a drug that increases adrenaline also called epinephrine sometimes also increases cortisol the point being that elevations in autonomic arousal after one is exposed to information increases one's memory for that information and one's memory for the details of that information now in this particular study they compared emotionally Laden versus non- emotionally Laden information and a bunch of other details which are interesting if you choose to puru this study but I should mention that other studies from this and other Laboratories have shown time and time again increases in autonomic arousal measured by increases is in cortisol or adrenaline also called epinephrine or norepinephrine which is the sort of analog within the brain that consistently leads to better memory for information that one has been exposed to better memory for the details of that information and oftentimes better ability to work with that information to come up with new ideas with that information or to think logically about that information in new ways in other words increasing autonomic arousal improves learning in memory now it's also very important to understand that that increase in autonomic arousal can improve learning a memory if the autonomic arousal occurs after the exposure to the material most people find that a bit surprising I certainly did when I first read this paper it makes sense if you start to think about the Persistence of memories for things like traumas or bad events right bad event happens and there's this big spike in cortisol and adrenaline and those memories are hard to eradicate there's certainly hard to remove the emotional content from and if you think about it in those instances the event happens and then comes the big increase in cortisol and adrenaline so that Maps very well onto the study that I'm describing here in addition however lots of Studies have shown that increasing autonomic arousal as measured by increases in Adrenaline or cortisol or both or any number of different measures of autonomic arousal that occurs during the exposure to the new material okay so this isn't trauma this is like new math material new history material new music material new motor skill skill material that you're trying to learn increases an autonomic rousel that occur as you're trying to so-called encode the information you're being exposed to that new information also significantly improve learning and it's always through increases in arousal in other words whether or not you're measuring cortisol adrenaline heart rate blood pressure galvanic skin response how wide someone's pupils are or small someone's pupils are or any combination of those things or any other measures of autonomic arousal the consistent takeaway is increases in arousal during or after in particular after trying to learn a certain material is going to improve significantly the amount of material that one learns the details of that material and the Persistence of that learning over time I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens as some body who's been involved in research science for almost three decades and in health and fitness for equally as long I'm constantly looking for the best tools to improve my mental health physical health and performance I discovered ag1 way back in 2012 long before I ever had a podcast or even knew what a podcast was and I've been taking it every day since I find that ag1 greatly improves all aspects of my health I simply feel much better when I take it ag1 uses the highest quality ingredients in the right combinations and they're constantly improving their formulas without without increasing the cost in fact ag1 just launched their latest formula upgrade this new formula is based on exciting new research on the effects of probiotics on the gut microbiome and now includes several clinically studied probiotic strains shown to support both digestive health and immune system Health as well as to improve bowel regularity and to reduce bloating whenever I'm asked if I could take Just One supplement what would that supplement be I always say ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only January 2025 ag1 is giving away 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again go to drink a1.com huberman to claim the 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 today's episode is also brought To Us by David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 g of protein only 150 calories and 0 g of sugar that's right 28 g of protein protein and 75% of its calories come from protein These Bars from David also taste amazing my favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough but then again I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one and I also like the cake flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're incredibly delicious for me personally I strive to eat mostly Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a high quality protein source with David I'm able to get 28 grams of protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and it allows me to do that without taking in excess calories I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon or even midafternoon if I want to bridge that gap between lunch and dinner I like that it's a little bit sweet so it tastes like a tasty snack but it's also giv me that 28 gram of very high quality protein with just 150 calories if you would like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is David /u okay so now we've established the elevated levels of autonomic arousal either during or after and indeed also before about of learning the so-called encoding phase of learning when we're exposed to the new material that we want to learn and remember are all beneficial this is wonderful news when we look out on the whole of the literature on the relationship between exercise and brain health and performance we see studies that incorporate exercise either before or after about of learning and we also find studies believe it or not that combine exercise with learning in real time literally exposing people to new material that they're expected to learn or trying to learn while they're walking on a treadmill or running on a treadmill or cycling or rowing yes those Studies have also been done although for practical reasons they're not as numerous as the studies exploring the relationship between exercise and learning where the exercise is done before or after the bout of learning okay so what this means is wonderful what this means is that if you want to use exercise not just for enhancing your bodily Health but also for brain health and performance you can do that exercise before during or after bouts of learning that allows you to look at the constraints of your life for instance are you one of these people that can get up at 5 or 6 or 7: a.m. and exercise before everyone else gets up or before your workday starts or your school day starts do a round of exercise and then get into your bouts of learning whatever that material may be or are you somebody who has to dive into the work day school day family obligations Etc in which case you might only be able to exercise later in the day but you're probably still somebody who would like to enhance their brain health and performance so in that case you might organize the thing that you're trying to learn the encoding or the exposure to the thing that you're trying to learn either in written form so you're reading or you're listening to it or you're attending a class or classes and then exercising after you're exposed to that material in order to get that elevated levels of arousal not unlike the arrangement of the studies that I was talking about earlier which used the ice exposure in order to generate increases in arousal and thereby to improve learning and memory so in the show note captions for this episode we've batched a number of different references that have explored the relationship between exercise and cognitive performance and across those studies and the ones that are referenced therein you'll find studies where the exercise bout was done before or the exercise bout was done during or the exercise bout was done after a round of learning or encoding of information and I should mention that different studies focus on different cognitive tasks so exercise and the arousal associated with exercise has been shown to acutely improve recall so just raw recall of material the details in material it's been shown to improve cognitive flexibility through things like the Stroop task and so in a very convenient way exercise has been shown to acutely improve performance on all those sorts of brain and memory tasks which is greatly reassuring to all of us because what it means is that it probably doesn't matter so much when you do your exercise or what it is that you're trying to learn it's going to be beneficial as long as the thing that you're trying to learn and the exercise are positioned fairly closely in time now the one caveat to that is that several studies have explored the relationship between short duration high-intensity interval training and cognitive performance in particular executive function that cognitive prefrontal flexibility that we were talking about a few moments ago and on the whole all of those studies point to improvements in executive control and function so that context dependent switching of knowledge and your ability to think about things in a in a very agile way if you will if people did a high-intensity interval training session just before they do that bout of cognitive flexibility learning however several studies have also looked at the effect of repeated bouts of high-intensity interval training and in some some cases looking at the mechanisms by which high-intensity interval training improveed cognitive performance and the basic takeaway is the following and again I'll provide references to these in the show note captions that high-intensity interval training done before or believe it or not even during cognitive flexibility tasks a couple of Studies have actually explored that significantly improves performance on those tasks again we believe this is likely through enhanced levels of arousal although some data also point to the fact that it's also likely through enhanced cerebral blood flow simply more blood being delivered to the brain during or in particular after high-intensity interval training more blood more fuel and other molecules being delivered to the brain during a cognitive task or cognitive flexibility task makes sense why that would improve cognitive function and yet when Studies have explored the consequence of doing multiple high-intensity interval training sessions and when I say high intensity I mean high intensity these are studies where lactate is elevated we'll talk more about lactate in a few minutes where typically people's heart rate is either close to or at their maximum heart rate for some period of time either 30 seconds 60 seconds 2 minutes or in some cases people are pushing really really hard for four minutes then resting for four minutes then pushing really hard for four minutes then resting for four minutes four times over the so-called 4x4 program that I know a number of you have heard about if you haven't it's very intense so you can imagine all out for four minutes then rest all out for four minutes then rest doing that several times in a day okay so two bouts of 4x4 or two high-intensity interval training sessions of any kind has been shown to diminish cognitive performance if the cognitive task comes after the second high-intensity interval training session now for most of us including me that makes sense you think well they're tired um you know people aren't able to focus as much because they're devoting all this energy to the exercise and indeed that's true although the mechanism is interesting the studies that have looked at this have actually found that cerebral blood flow during the two bouts of high-intensity interval training are more or less equal so it's not that the first session necessarily precludes high performance in the high-intensity interval training session of in the second session but then when you go on to try and do a cognitive task that's demanding and also requires elevated levels of cerebral blood flow you find that performance drops and this is correlated with reductions in cerebral blood flow that come from doing too much high-intensity interval training now I have to acknowledge that most people aren't doing multiple high-intensity interval training sessions per day but this is a reminder an important reminder in fact that if you're using exercise to try and improve brain health and function or even if you're just somebody who's exercising but is also expected to use their brain to learn things throughout the day as most of us are and to attend to things throughout the day you need to be cautious about not overdoing the high-intensity interval training sessions this is also true for resistance training you need to be aware that very high-intensity exercise yes increases cerebral blood flow and the Del delivery of all these fuels and other compounds to your brain during the exercise if you do that correctly and you don't overdo it you can capture some of that wave of blood flow fuel Etc as you enter the learning session but if you quote unquote overdo it then you're going to arrive to that bout of learning with reduced cerebral blood flow and you're going to be in a state that it's very difficult to focus and learn new information so there is such a thing as too much arousal from exercise that leads to troughs in arousal that diminish cognitive performance and learning now all of this is focused of course on the relationship between exercise and brain function at the acute level the immediate level it's fair to say that all high-intensity exercise and resistance training is going to support brain function in The Chronic sense in the long-term sense in fact the literature points to that and once again I've batched the references for this episode so that they're grouped together according to the specific topics and time stamps and the two studies that I recommend you look at if you're interested in this relationship between high-intensity training and cognitive function in particular executive function that cognitive flexibility I was talking about earlier such as in the Stroop task there's a wonderful article entitled executive function after exhaustive exercise that's one to look at and the other one which I think is really nice and therefore I've placed there really points to the way that a single bout of exercise can acutely improve brain function in particular executive function and the title of that paper not surprisingly is a single bout of resistance exercise can enhance episodic memory performance here's a fun one as I continue to hammer on this thesis that so many of the positive effects of exercise on brain health and performance at least in the acute sense immediately after the exercise some cases during the exercise are due to arousal well then it should make sense why things like so-called exercise snacks you know this idea that you know throughout the day you you know suddenly do 25 quick jumping jacks or you you know you jump up and down five times or you do 20 air squats you know we've heard about exercise snacks in different context such as you know adjusting blood glucose levels you hear a lot about that you know after meals you know take a walk or do some jumping jacks really quick or you know do 20 air squats throughout the day and people talk about the sort of outsize positive effects of those well check this out when it comes to high-intensity interval training and positive effects on cognitive performance there's a study entitled the influence of acute Sprint interval training on cognitive performance in healthy younger adults and this study has people do 6C all out efforts you heard that right six seconds okay so six six seconds it always is tricky they always use the same number it's the you know four by4 by four okay six yes the number six 6C allout efforts sprinting on basically a stationary bike and then a period of rest of one minute between those sixc allout efforts and they see a significant Improvement in cognitive performance so yes it's true that you can do very brief very intense bouts of exercise I mean just think about 6 seconds of sprinting one minute of just Cruis or rest 6 seconds and then just repeat for six Sprints total of six seconds each and experience an enhancement that is an acute or immediate enhancement in cognitive function and I can imagine no other mechanistic explanation for that aside from increased levels of autonomic arousal any other mechanism that you could envision you know igf1 Iris bdnf things that we'll talk about in a few minutes yes those might be deployed as well but in terms of seeing something so brief having such a fast action on cognitive performance and given what you now know about the relationship between arousal focus and cognitive performance I'd be willing to stake let's say six of my 10 fingers on the idea that it's all due to enhanced autonomic arousal okay let's talk for a few minutes about the mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health and performance and I realize when I say mechanism some of you may say okay well I just want to know what to do I don't need to hear about the mechanisms but in this case understanding just a little bit about the pathways by which exercise impacts the brain can give you a ton of Leverage in designing the best exercise schedule for your brain health and performance and frankly for your exercise schedule generally to generate things like fat loss improvements and strength hypertrophy endurance and so on in fact let's do this mental experiment together if we were to ask ourselves how is it that exercise improves brain health and performance based on what you know now you'd probably say Well it increases arousal the catacol amine so dopamine epinephrine nor epinephrine it probably increases heart rate so more blood pumping to the brain and so on and so forth and you would be correct about all of that but let's just think a little bit more deeply about how exercise actually impacts the brain in the short and long term and ask ourselves what are the different physical Pathways what are the different chemical Pathways by which the movement of our body changes the way that our brain works in the short and long term so if we were to draw a stick figure of a human and of Orient ourselves to the different locations or organs in the body that contain potential sources of information for the brain one place that we could start would be of course the heart when you do cardiovascular exercise of any kind intense or not so intense short or long your heart rate increases your blood pressure increases likewise if you do resistance training there will be heart rate increases those heart rate increases will come down between sets but your heart rate tends to increase when you exercise that's sort of a duh well when your heart rate increases there's actually both increased blood flow to the brain and the delivery of all the things that that blood carries but there are also neural Pathways that carry signals about that heart rate about those blood pressure changes to the brain in order to increase our levels of alertness and focus that we can leverage toward learning so the first location in the body that we know can communicate with the brain is the heart when our heart beats faster that's communicated to our autonomic nervous system which resides in a number of different brain areas in fact it's a network of brain areas that act in concert to create what we call autonomic arousal we also have another pathway that goes back from the brain to the heart and other organs that we call the vagus nerve which is a two- directional pathway you know up from the body to the brain and from the brain back to the body we're going to talk a lot about the Vegas in fact let's talk about the Vegas now when we exercise we release adrenaline which is also called epinephrine from our adrenal glands which are small glands that reside at top both of our kidneys that adrenaline or epinephrine as it's also called does many things in our body it's responsible for increasing our heart rate further it's responsible for a number of effects on the so-called endothelial cells that make up the vessels and capillar iies and it has impacts on the neurons in our body that create all sorts of changes in the way that blood flows how fast it flows and so on and so forth now here's a key thing to understand adrenaline epinephrine does not cross the bloodb brain barrier so the adrenaline from our adrenals doesn't actually get into the brain to stimulate elevated levels of alertness rather it acts on receptors on the vagus nerve again the vagus nerve communicates with the brain and also in the vagus nerve certain brain areas communicate with the body so adrenaline has a lot of effects within the body but when it's released it also acts on so-called adrenergic receptors on the vagus nerve then the vagus nerve is activated in a way that stimulates the activity of a brain area because remember the vagus goes from the body into the brain stimulates the so-called NST and because neuroanatomists like to argue about naming sometimes it'll also be called the NTS the nucleus of the solitary tract or the nucleus tractus solitus super annoying I know forget the acronym unless you want to know that it's sometimes NST and sometimes it's NTS don't ask me why neuro anatomists do this in any case the NST can then communicate with a really important brain area whose name you should remember which is the locus cerus the locus cerus contains neurons that release among other things nor epinephrine which is similar in action to epinephrine but different neurons in the locus ceria send those little wires that we call axons into the brain in a very widespread manner it's almost as if they're positioned to sprinkler the brain with a neurochemical and that neurochemical is norepinephrine they also have the capacity to release other neurochemicals but right now we're concentrating on norepinephrine when norepinephrine is released from the locus cerus it has this tendency to elevate the levels of activity in other brain areas through this sort of sprinkling like mechanism what that means is that other areas of the brain such as your prefrontal cortex such as your hippocampus such as different areas of the hypothalamus and indeed lots of brain circuits all have a a greater capacity to be engaged this is what we're talking about when we talk about autonomic arousal release of adrenaline from the adrenals that has action within the body elevated heart rate blood pressure Etc and then adrenaline also from the adrenals to the Vegas from the Vegas to the NST NST to Locus cerius and then Locus cerus sprinkl the brain with this norepinephrine raising the levels of Baseline activity in all those brain areas and making them more likely to be engaged by things that we're trying to attend to more likely to engage say the neurons of the prefrontal cortex that can learn context dependent strategy switching such as an aou task or when we're trying to attend to information and we go okay here's something important I I need to pay attention to this we're able to do that because of that elevated level of norepinephrine it facilitates it's permissive for elevating our levels of attention and focus it's also permissive for our hippocampus to encode new memories and for a bunch of other brain areas to do their thing so to speak so knowing these mechanisms is actually worthwhile if you've ever heard that exercise can give you energy this is the basis of that statement right many people in fact myself for many years thought okay I definitely have to sleep well in order to have energy and focus that's absolutely true still true will always be true I should maybe have some caffeine be hydrated you know well-nourished all this stuff in order to have the energy to exercise but it's also true that exercise gives us energy and this is how it gives us energy when we move our body the adrenals release adrenaline and the adrenaline acts through two different so-called parallel Pathways within the body but again it doesn't cross the bloodb brain barrier so then there's a series of what we call signaling relays or circuit relays up to the locus culus and then a sort of analog it's different but an analog to epinephrine norepinephrine is released within the brain and lo and behold we have elevated levels of both bodily energy and brain energy in Focus that we can devote to that exercise but also to the learning that comes after that exercise which explains pretty much everything that we've talked about up until now during the course of this podcast so the next time you're feeling a little tired and you don't want to work out remember exercise gives you energy through the pathways that I just described now anytime I talk about the adrenals people start talking about adrenal burnout they say you burn out your adrenals you know there are these crazy theories that you'll hear out there you know coffee burns out your adrenals not true you'll hear that if you exercise too much it might burn out your energy or your adrenals look you have enough capacity within your adrenals to survive relatively long famines to survive long bouts of challenge stress of many many different kinds short challenges and so on you're not going to burn out your adrenals there is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome which is a real syndrome there are diseases of the adrenals but that's not what we're referring to here you have plenty of adrenaline in your adrenals that you can deploy through movement through exercise to get the elevation and arousal attention and so forth that we've been talking about in fact there's a a set of biological Pathways that were just recently discovered that will allow you to understand how to use movement in order to engage your adrenals so that then those adrenals can release adrenaline impact your vagus impact the organs of your body the locus cerus and elevate your levels of attention and focus and a lot of the core components of these pathways are highlighted in a paper that I absolutely love another paper I absolutely love this is from Peter strick's laboratory at University of Pittsburgh which is entitled the mindbody problem circuits that link the cerebral cortex to the adrenal Medela the adrenal Medela are those adrenals that I've been referring to in the body and the question that Peter strick and colleagues asked was how is it that movement actually gets the adrenals to release adrenaline like what's the signal does it come from the muscles does it come from you know the skeleton it's perfectly reasonable to assume that there are signals that come from the muscles and from the skeleton that cause the adrenals to release adrenaline when we exercise but what stri colleagues did was actually super clever they took some new tools that had just become available these are tools that allow the tracing of neural circuits from organs in the body all the way back up to the brain or from one brain structure to another brain structure and then to yet another brain structure we don't have time to go into all the technical details but this is a technique that perhaps I'll talk about on a future podcast it's one that my laboratory used for a number of years to trace other neural Pathways what they discovered is that there are essentially three Cate categories of brain areas all of which communicate with the adrenals and can cause them to release adrenaline to create this elevation and arousal and attention those three brain areas include areas of the brain that are involved in thinking what we call cognition areas of the brain that are related to what are called effective states which is just kind of a more General category that includes emotions okay if you saw the hubman Lab podcast episode that I did with Lisa Feldman Barrett she explains beautifully the distinction between affect States and emotions but these are brain areas that basically relate to what we are feeling or how we're perceiving our environment and how we're reacting to it these sorts of things and then there's a third category of brain areas that most robustly communicates with the adrenals and these are a collection of brain areas that are all involved with movement of particular areas of our body these areas are broadly referred to as the motor Network so these are areas of the so-called cerebral cortex which are in the outer portion of the brain and they send these wires down the spinal cord there's a little relay in the spinal cord called the IML if you're interested in the anatomical details I'll put the link to this paper in the show note captions in any case these brain areas that are involved in motor movement send axons those wires down to the spinal cord then from the spinal cord they send a relay out via What's called the colonic preganglionic neurons basically what ends up happening is that acetylcholine which is a neurom modulator is released from these neurons that originate in the spinal cord onto the adrenal Mela and then the adrenal Medela the so-called adrenals same thing adrenal Medela adrenals releases adrenaline that creates these effects in the body on the heart the muscles and other tissues and then as described before that adrenaline also acts on the vagus the Vagas up to the NST Locus culus and we have this elevation and alertness so this paper and papers that came subsequent to it really explain how it is that the move movement of our body AKA exercise allows us to have this elevation in arousal and alertness it's a loop okay the adrenals release adrenaline they do these things by these two parallel Pathways I've been talking about but your decision to engage these motor areas to move particular areas of your body is what deploys that adrenaline now you might be thinking well duh okay when I exercise there's adrenaline release in order to exercise I need to move my body and these brain areas control the movement of my body but it's not a duh it's actually very profound because it turns out that the specific brain areas that best activate the adrenals are the brain areas that control the muscles closest to the midline the core musculature and the Brain areas that are involved in generating the sorts of movements that we would call compound movements at least in the context of resistance training or that are responsible for moving multiple joints at the same time so what this means in the practical sense is if you are feeling sluggish you want energy or you're simply exercising both for bodily effects and for brain effects you need the deployment of adrenaline of epinephrine you need the deployment of norepinephrine in the brain and by the way anytime you have a deployment of norepinephrine in the brain almost always there's a coordinated action of release of dopamine which most people have heard of by now dopamine is involved in motivation as well as movement Etc so the simple takeaway here is if you want to get the Al that comes from exercise in order to use that arousal to leverage it towards better cognition brain health Etc the key thing is to make sure that you're doing exercises that are compound exercises so that these would be the movements you can look these up just say compound exercises you can put that anywhere and you'll see that that includes things like squats deadlifts you know bench presses dips pull-ups rows and yes of course you want to train your whole body so that you have you know symmetry of a function of strength and you want to offset any injuries and things of that sort or aesthetic reasons perhaps but the idea here is if you want energy from exercise you want Focus you need the deployment of the neurochemicals that we've been discussing most notably epinephrine and norepinephrine and through the identification of this motor Network as well as the effective and cognitive networks that Converge on this area of the spinal cord and then send communication to the adrenal Medela you can essentially control the levels of arousal that your body and brain produces so in describing this my hope is that you'll no longer think about exercise as just elevating your heart rate or you no longer think about exercise just as moving your body but rather that the movement of your body is creating specific neurochemical outcomes both in the body and the brain that create the arousal that initiates the improvements in focus and attention that allow you to learn better and that contribute generally to brain Health and Longevity and of course you ifado out there will remind me I'm sure but I'm going to beat you to the punch here yes your hypothalamus is also talking to your pituitary which releases certain chemicals into your bloodstream which also go to your adrenals to cause your adrenals to deploy both adrenaline epinephrine as well as cortisol that pathway is still intact okay but that's a slightly slower pathway here I'm focusing on the neural Pathways some of which have only recently been discovered in the last 5 or 10 years that work very very fast to generate the sorts of arousal that are relevant to brain function and brain long ity okay nothing has changed in terms of the old story about how the brain impacts the adrenals that's all still there but here we're into the modern stuff and by the way for those of you that are interested in things like psychosomatic disorders trauma and how trauma can quote unquote be stored in the body and not so much stored in the body but how it can impact the body and then how the body itself can impact the brain this paper has also been used as support for the idea that indeed those effective areas those emotional areas those cognitive areas have a route by which they can communicate with the adrenal Medela to cause the release of adrenaline when we have specific thoughts it was always known that if we have specific thoughts it can quote unquote stress us out our heart rate can go up Etc this paper also provides a reasonable anatomical substrate for that phenomenon you know I never want to make too much of any one single paper or finding but I will say that after I read that paper from stricken colleagues and through some of the subsequent discussions about that paper that I overheard at meetings and so forth it really made me think differently about exercise and now anytime that I'm feeling tired provided that I'm not chronically sleep deprived or something of that sort I remind myself that if I start moving my body in particular if I engage core muscles was one of the key findings in that paper that the areas of the brain that control the core muscles as well as do compound movements I move multiple joints I start you know warming up in a way that includes some you know maybe even just air squats or some running in place or jumping jacks things of that sort that the increase in energy that I'm perceiving is real it's based on the same neurochemical outputs that would occur had I gone into the gym or to the run or whatever workout with tons of energy it would just have increased the level of adrenaline further so this idea that we can actually control our body with our mind and to some extent our mind with our body that's absolutely true and this is one of the tools that I find particularly useful anytime I want to overcome that wall of kind of resistance to not doing the physical exercise that I know I and basically all of us should be doing I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides test of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from talk doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetal cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function okay so let's think just a little bit more about how the body communicates with the brain shuring exercise both in order to understand the mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health and function but also ways that we can leverage that to improve brain health and function by using exercise one of the more interesting and powerful and indeed surprising ways that the body communicates with the brain during exercise to improve brain health and indeed our ability to remember things and to learn is the way that our bones our skeleton when they're under loads okay when they experience mechanical stress not severe mechanical stress that would break them but but mechanical stress they release hormones in particular something called osteocalcin now you might be thinking wait the bones release hormones yes your bones release hormones one of which is called osteocalcin osteocalcin is an incredible molecule animal studies that were done mainly at Columbia school of medicine but later also at Columbia and elsewhere in humans have shown that osteocalcin is released from the bones during exercise both in mice and in humans travels to the brain so it can cross the bloodb brain barrier and there it can encourage the growth of neurons and their connections within the hip hi a campus an area of the brain that's vitally important for the encoding of new memories and there are some data not a ton but there's some data which suggests that perhaps I want to highlight underscore and bold face perhaps can increase the number of neurons in the so-called dentate gyrus of the hippocampus to allow even better capacity for memory now osteocalcin is therefore a really interesting molecule Right comes from Bones travels to the brain improves functioning of the hippocampus which is important for learning in memory that's amazing and it does so in part through the actions of something that most of you perhaps have heard of which is called bdnf or brain derived neutrophic Factor now it's very important for us to understand that anytime we hear about exercise increases a growth factor and by the way exercise increases brain derived neutrophic Factor it increases growth factors that cause the growth of endothelial cells so blood vessels we'll talk more about that in a moment and it increases nerve growth factor it's not just bdnf there are lots of different growth factors a few of which ngf and bdnf act on neurons and other growth factors that act on endothelial cells vasculature it seems that a lot of the effects of bdnf on the brain that are caused by doing exercise and that benefit us in terms of short and long-term memory our ability to encode new things and remember them for long periods of time to resist age related degeneration because that's the case indeed that our hippocampus decreases in volume over time as we age just natur natur even in somebody that doesn't have Alzheimer's dementia and exercise can adjust the slope of that decline significantly provided there's enough exercise and the appropriate exercise I don't think all but many of the effects of bdnf appear to be mediated by osteocalcin what this means is that any exercise program that's designed not just to benefit our body but also our brain health and performance should do something to load the skeleton in some sort of impactful way that causes the release of osteocalcin now unfortunately there has not been a systematic exploration of the specific types of exercise that best cause the release of osteocalcin in humans but based on what we understand about how osteocalcin is made and released it seems reasonable to assume and reasonable to employ some exercise within your weekly exercise that involves jumping of some sort in particular jumping where you have to control the Ecentric or Landing portion of that jump now I'm certainly not the first to talk about this it's been discussed in a different context that is jumping and Landing has been discussed in a different context namely by Peter AA and others who have talked about the fact that as people age one of the primary causes of mortality are the infections and the lack of Mobility caused by Falls that people generally have when they're going downstairs or down things stepping down is a common source of falls falls are are a common source of breaking things breaking things is a common source of inactivity and inactivity is a common source of infections and other things that lead to earlier mortality what this means for all of us young middle-aged and old is that we should include some form of jumping in our weekly exercise now you could imagine doing that within your high-intensity interval training provided you can do it safely and not get injured but this is also a call for all of us to think about including say some jumping rope and if you're going to jump rope maybe not just jumping you know a centimeter off the ground to be able to just consistently Skip Skip Skip Skip Along but maybe doing some high knees maybe doing some double unders if you can do those um perhaps doing some box jumps so jumping off boxes of different heights again what you can do safely without getting injured no doubt is going to provide load to the skeleton I guess unless you're doing it underwater in outer space it's hard to imagine how it wouldn't and that seems to me like the most direct way to employ this osteocalcin pathway this pathway from from the bones to the brain and neurogenesis in the hippocampus I do believe is likely to underly a lot of the enhancement of learning and memory that's seen in terms of the chronic effects of exercise on brain health and brain function over time that is not just the things that exercise does via arousal in the minutes and hours after exercise but the way the exercise can improve literally the size and structure of one of the most critical structures in our brain that's responsible for learning a memory the hippocampus and of course there are a lot of other ways that the body communicates with the brain we definitely don't have time to go through all of them but it's worth thinking about a few of them logically just in terms of listing them off and thinking about how they might communicate with the brain to improve brain Health and Longevity when you exercise you utilize fuel differently depending on whether or not you're relying on glycogen or fatty acids and of course it's going to depend on how long you've been exercising and the type of exercise and what you're using for fuel literally the foods you eat Etc we don't have time to go into all of that but get this turns out that there are liver to brain neural Pathways so your liver can communicate with neurons and other cells in your brain including the gal cells the cells that are important for regulating energy metabolism and a bunch of other things too your liver can communicate to your brain both through neural Pathways and by releasing things into your bloodstream that then communicate to your brain oh the body is using a different source of fuel it's been using different sources or combinations of fuels for the last 20 minutes maybe you should adjust your brain state in order to be able to cope with that or in response to that and of course there are other organs in the body that are communicating with the brain also your diaphragm for instance is communicating with your brain through indirect Pathways about how you're breathing during exercise and of course your brain is controlling your diaphragm too via a number of stations including the pathway that includes the frenic nerve which controls the diaphragm the point here is that once you start exercising of course that has an impact on the organs in your body they change the way that they're functioning your heart your liver your adrenals your skeleton literally your bones and of course your muscles and they are releasing things that impact brain function either directly or indirectly once you start thinking about exercise in that context even if we don't parse each and every one of those Pathways individually you can start thinking about exercise as a mult factorial way of enhancing and changing brain activity so that it positions it to learn better in the subsequent hours and days as well as modifying areas of the brain like the hippocampus by making certain brain areas literally bigger more powerful at engaging the sorts of things that they do in the case of the hippocampus learning in the case of the prefrontal cortex context dependent decision-making updating strategies these sorts of things and generally speaking exercise causes the release of things like bdnf bring der neutrophic factor and nerve growth factor that enhance the health and stability of existing neuron connections and something that is very rarely if ever discussed publicly not because it's some sort of secret that people want to keep but I just don't hear it discussed is that bdnf is an activity dependent molecule it's a molecule that can serve to stabilize and enhance the growth of neurons keep their connections in place grow new connections and it does so when neur neurons are active so the point is that bdnf has to be released in order for that to happen but the release of bdnf itself is activity dependent and it acts best on neurons that are already active so if ever there was a mechanism that could explain why it is that people that exercise regularly seem to maintain healthier brains into later life it's that one it's that bdnf is activity dependent when I say Activity dependent I mean the electrical activity of neurons is what causes the release of bdnf and once bdnf is released it has the best opportunity to stabilize and enhance the growth of existing neurons if those other neurons are already active now if we were to list off all the different Pathways and mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health and performance it would be a list of probably I don't know somewhere between 40 and 100 different molecular Pathways and probably I don't know somewhere between 12 and 20 different anatomical Pathways and we certainly don't have time for all that I don't think that's what you're interested in I've tried to just highlight some of the key ones today one additional one that I'd like to highlight is the lactate pathway or the impact of lactate when we exercise this is getting discussed more and more these days on podcast and elsewhere one interesting finding for instance is that lactate is what's produced when we exercise intensely our muscles produce lactate and lactate is a very powerful appetite suppressant now some of you may be saying well and I exercise hard I get really really hungry well that may be true but it's also true that if you exercise really really hard and then you hydrate well and you wait a little while often times that hunger will subside I'm not saying that you should starve yourself after exercise fuel as needed for you if you're an intermittent faster do that thing if you like to eat right after you exercise do that do what's best for you but understand that lactate has powerful effects on our appetite because why because lactate has powerful effects not just on our body body but on our brain and it is able to impact the activity of neurons in our so-called hypothalamus little marbleized region above the roof of our mouth that contains some of the neurons that control our appetite and our degree of satiety so the point here is that lactate is a molecule produced in the body that can actually signal to the brain most of you perhaps have heard that lactate can be used as a fuel for neurons during exercise lactate is the preferred fuel for neurons under most circumstances especially under circum ances of intense exercise that spares glucose for other things including for cognitive work later on this is perhaps one of the reasons why when people do intense exercise provided it's not too long and too intense and then you go to learn something you have enhanced Focus it's because of the arousal we've been talking about all along today but it's also because we believe that there's glucose there's fuel that's been spared that then can be used by the neurons because during the exercise you weren't using quite as much glucose you were using less lactate now lactate is also a stimulus for something called the blood brain barrier which is made up of endothelial cells specialized endothelial cells that act as a barrier so that certain things in particular large molecules can't cross from the body into the brain lactate stimulates the release of something called vegf vgf which is basically an endothelial growth factor that promotes the stability and growth of the blood brain barrier this is very important in the context of brain Health and Longevity and longevity in particular because one of the major features of age related cognitive decline and one that's greatly exacerbated in Alzheimer's is a breakdown of the bloodb brain barrier so the Integrity the structure and function of the bloodb brain barrier is something that's very important and related to brain health and exercise that's intense enough to produce lactate causes the increase in vegf that acts on and within the endothelial cells to improve the Integrity of the bloodb brain barrier and because I mentioned the asites earlier and because I did my postto with somebody that was sort of famous for popularizing the study of asites when no one else wanted to study the asites now everybody studies the asites but I have to mention something about asites which no they're not just a support cell certain types of cells in the brain are called Gia the Gia come in multiple forms oligodendrocytes in the periphery they're called Schwan cells but then you also have asites and asites sit around the synapse they in sheath synapses remember synapses are the communication points between neurons and the astrocytes are beautifully positioned to read out the amount of activity that's occurring between neurons and produce fuel for those neurons so the astrocytes mainly use glucose for fuel but they can produce lactate so again we have this activity dependent phenomenon that is when certain neurons are very very active the asites are able to produce more lactate the neurons can use lactate spares glucose and a bunch of great things happen when I say great things happen I mean in the context of the ways that exercise can improve brain function because those elevated levels of lactate in turn also increase bdnf we already talked about the blood brain barrier basically the muscles producing lactate is terrific but the asites producing lactate for the neurons to feed on is also terrific because lactate can be used as a fuel and it triggers all these Downstream or subsequent mechanisms including bdnf so basically what we're talking about is the lots and lots of ways that exercise improves brain health in the longterm bdnf brain plasticity stability of synapses and so forth maybe even new neurons maybe not a lot of evidence for that in humans yet frankly but maybe and exercise can improve brain function in the short term through mechanisms of arousal but also through alternate fuel usage such as lactate from the body and from cells within the brain that we call the astrocytes and the release of all sorts of other things igf1 to promote more vasculature and on and on and on it's really quite beautiful the sort of wave front of molecules and neural Pathways that's initiated when we exercise provided we exercise intensely enough so this is a you know double and triple call for including at least some high-intensity interval training V2 max type training each week as well as doing resistance training and of course the long duration cardiovascular training the sort of you know 30 or 45 or 60 Minute or maybe even 2our zone two type stuff you can look up zone two but it's basically a level of cardiovascular training that still allows you to talk but were you to go any more intensely you wouldn't be able to complete sentences that zone two training of course is going to be very powerful for the health and integrity of the cardiovascular system that's going to allow for the delivery of all these molecules and of course the delivery of blood flow itself to the brain because cerebral blood flow is Central to brain function okay so if you're right at the threshold of about to be overwhelmed by the number of different mechanisms by which exercise improves brain function and health we're not going to add any more mechanisms we are however going to talk about the Practical steps that you can take to make sure that you're getting the most brain benefits from your exercise based on what we've talked about so far as well as a broad survey of the literature and again it is a big literature here are the four things that I believe everyone should be doing every single week in terms of their exercise program now we've talked a lot about exercise on this podcast before can summarize the very very top Contour of what my takeaway is from the literature and from discussions with experts such as Dr Andy Galpin and others which is I believe that everybody should include both resistance training could be body weight free weights machines some combination of those as well as cardiovascular training each week and that the cardiovascular training should include both high-intensity interval training at least once per week and some so-called long slow distance training or zone two type training each week so presumably most of you are doing some form of that so maybe you're doing more cardio than resistance training maybe you're doing more resistance training than cardio if you're interested in a zeroc cost program where you can you know start to sculpt out a idealized program for you but you want to start with a kind of General template we have a newsletter that you can access at hubman lab.com zero cost you don't even have to sign up to access it although if you want to sign up for the newsletter that could be valuable to you too completely zero cost you can go to hubman lab.com go to newsletter scroll down to foundational Fitness protocol it describes the program that I've been following essentially for 30 plus years and again it's about three cardiovascular training sessions per week three resistance training sessions per week the cardiovascular training ranges in time from about 12 minutes and then a longer 60 Minute session the resistance training is generally 45 to 75 minutes so on average about an hour and it might sound like a lot but but when you look at that foundational Fitness protocol what you realize is that some of the workouts are really really short some of them are a little bit longer none of them are longer than an hour so it's pretty reasonable to do and I certainly did it while working well to be frank extremely long hours for many many years so provided your sleep is intact and other areas of your life are are dialed in with stress Etc should be doable for most everybody but modify it according to what you need or if you're doing something completely different more power to you I just want you to know that's available as a zero cost resource if you want to check it out with all of that said whatever exercise you happen to be doing or you happen to be planning I do believe it should include four things specifically to improve brain health and performance although these four things will also benefit you at the level of your bodily health no doubt the first thing is to include at least one workout per week that is of a long slow distance nature so zone two type cardio maybe you get a little bit up into zone three but basically jogging swimming rowing any activity that you can carry out consistently for 45 to 75 minutes without getting injured right people always say well do I have to run no if you don't like running and running's too hard on your body or you'll get injured then do something else maybe you do the rower maybe you ride a stationary bike maybe you ride a road bike for me it's jogging generally or hiking with a weight vest those are the things that I enjoy and that I can do without getting injured but for other people it's a different it's a different exercise but at least one one long slow distance training session per week is going to be very beneficial for brain health because of the way that it impacts cerebral blood flow and athal health and basically the way that cardiovascular health improves brain function at the level of blood flow fuel delivery Etc the second thing is to include at least one workout per week that's of the so-called high-intensity interval training type now there are a lot of different types of high-intensity interval training out there in fact Dr Andy Galpin says you know we'll hear about say like the 4x4x4 protocol right four minutes of going as hard as you can for four minutes basically where there's no variation in the intensity through that whole four minutes you're going hard the whole four minutes but only as hard as you can for the entire four minutes then resting four minutes and then repeating that 4x4 cycle four times so that's one way to do it but Dr Andy Galpin would be the first to tell you that probably also get great results from a 3X3 by4 type of workout or a 6 by6 by six type of workout although for many people that's going to be too much and too intense or if you're me and you prefer a high-intensity interval training session that is more like a two minutes on as hard as you can go for two minutes and then rest for say three to four minutes and then repeat maybe four times maybe five times well then do that I have a high-intensity interval training session that I do when I'm very limited on time which involves getting on the airdine bike they sometimes called the assault bike there's a lot of resistance has that fan which always thought was to cool me off but then you know it's uh once I actually got on one and and and started riding I realized that that's to provide resistance so but basically if I'm limited on time I'll hop on there I'll pedal for about a minute or two just kind of warm up and then I'll go all out for a minute rest for 30 seconds all out for a minute rest for 30 seconds the first three or four of those Cycles feeling pretty good by the seventh and eighth one I'm you know um I'm praying and generally when one finishes that type of workout your heart rate is very very elevated now I don't tend to track my heart rate during exercise perhaps I should but I don't like to get you know too weigh down with technology when I exercise I like to go more on feel that's just me I find that my heart rate is extremely high right as I get off that thing but you know five minutes later it's back to Baseline and I certainly feel energized after doing that to go do some cognitive work to shower up and to head to work that sort of thing so pick a high-intensity interval training session that you can do at least once per week and that works for you and again it's really important to pick a form of exercise for the high-intensity interval training that you can do without getting injured this is so important you know one way to really limit your brain health and bodily health is to get injured and to not be able to exercise in a few minutes I'll tell you about what happens when you don't exercise for a certain duration and how that negatively impacts your brain health and it's not that long before that starts to happen but in the meantime the first was long slow distance or so-called Zone 2 so what we could call that LSD not the Psychedelic but long slow distance exercise second was high-intensity interval training or HIIT or hit the third would be Tut Tu time under ttention if you're doing resistance training and I do believe everybody should be doing resistance training there are a near infinite number of different ways to do resistance training as you well know you can move the weight ballistically you can control the Ecentric you can do any number of different things but some proportion of the exercises that you do during your resistance training during the week should include time under tension training where you're really emphasizing the contraction of the muscles the slow lowering of the weight as well as the lifting of the weight Contracting the muscles as hard as you can and this is really to emphasize the nerve to muscle Pathways and the way that time under tension promotes the release of things from muscles into the bloodstream that can positively impact the brain as well as the way that focusing your brain on exercises such that you're isolating muscles or even if you're not doing a so-called isolation exercise maybe you're doing a compound exercise like a dip or a squat or a deadlift but that really concentrating on the muscles that are supposed to be managing the work and not just moving the weight but challenging the muscles this very important think challenging the muscles using the weight not lifting weights or moving weights by focusing on time under tension you will of course get benefits as it relates to hypertrophy and strength increases in particular hypertrophy doing time under attention requires you to engage the what we call the upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron you have motor neurons in your cortex you also have motor neurons in your spinal cord those Pathways that then go out to the muscles and control the muscles in very deliberate ways and time under tension training is very beneficial for the deployment of the molecules that work both within the body but also within the brain to support brain health and function both in the short term and most particularly in the long term I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors mauii venison mauii venison is 100% wild harvested venison from the island of Maui and it is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be consuming about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day that protein provides critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but it also promotes overall health given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to Stave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories mauii venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that getting one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest in excess of calories also Maui Nei venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth I personally like all of those in fact I probably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if you're traveling a lot or you're simply on the go they have Maui Nei venison sticks which have 10 grams of protein per stick at just 55 calories and they're extremely convenient you can pretty much take them anywhere responsible population management of the axis deer on the island of Maui means they cannot go beyond a particular Harvest capacity signing up for a membership is therefore the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try mauii venison you can go to mauii venison docomo to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's mauii venison docomo okay so we have long slow distance high-intensity interval training and some degree of time under tension training with resistance training you might be asking how many sets What proportion that depends on your goals right if you're a powerlifter and you're trying to lift bigger weights or you simply want to get stronger not going to devote a lot of your training to time under tension most likely you're going to be focusing mostly on the performance of those lifts to move more weight but in my case what I do just for sake of example again this is just what I happen to do is I tend to make a full third of my resistance training just focused on time under tension so if I do two exercises typically the first exercise is a compound exercise so if it's a shoulder press for instance I'll do a couple warm-up sets and then the work sets I try and move the weight and generally I tend to work pretty pretty heavy in the for me heavy for me in the 4 to8 repetition range I'll try and move the weight as quickly as I can on the concentric phase the lifting phase and then at least twice as slow on the lowering phase and then I pause while keeping the muscles under tension I never really set the weight down at all during a set if I'm doing my job that is and then the second exercise that I do I really focus even more on time under tension so whether or not it's a compound exercise or an isolation exercise again compound exercise multiple joints mooving isolation exercise single joints moving I'll really concentrate on keeping the muscle under tension the entire time in fact I'll lift the weight off the stack if it's a machine or if it's a free weight just a little bit engage the muscles that I'm trying to activate or train and then keep it under tension throughout the concentric the contraction and the lowering of that weight and then never actually set it down until the end of the set AKA increasing the time under tension and then the fourth category of exercise that I believe everybody should include in their existing workouts or add if you're not currently working out is some sort of explosive jumping and or Ecentric Landing now the explosive jumping with Ecentric Landing you could do on a mat right most people won't do it on concrete because they're worried about impact that sort of thing but let's say you have some some mats or you're on a lawn or you're on dirt or you're you know jumping up onto a box as high as you can and then jumping down and controlling the Ecentric portion again pick something that you can do safely progress slowly right if you're going to jump up and off boxes you want to start with low boxes I know that many of you can jump quite High um and I'm not one of those people but if you can jump quite high and then you're going to jump off that box and you're going to do this as a new thing you'll notice that anytime you add Ecentric training to your workout regimen it tends to increase soreness a lot and often people get injured by including a new form of movement in particular form of movement that you can fall and or not just falling but by including a lot of Ecentric movements that they hadn't been doing previously again be really safe about this but that loading of the skeleton through Ecentric movement and controlling The Descent super important not just for your body not just to avoid Falls not just to improve coordination and a bunch of other great things but also to get that release of osteocalcin the improvements in bdnf brain performance brain health and so on and I'm guessing that most of you can probably incorp at these four things long slow distance high-intensity interval training some deliberate time under tension training during your resistance training again could be done with body weight doesn't have to even be done with machines or free weights as well as some explosive and Ecentric control training without adding any time to your existing workout regimen simply by incorporating it into whatever workouts you happen to already be doing and the explosive Ecentric troll training could be done frankly at the end of a run you could do it at the end of your zone two day you could do it on the end of a hit day whenever you do it and however you do it just try not to get injured that's the most important thing why well it turns out if you get injured you can't exercise sometimes you can and it's good to continue exercising provided you're not aggravating that injury but a lot of times you can't and there're actually studies of how quickly your brain starts to suffer if you don't exercise now most of these Studies have been done on very experienced athletes or people that are exercising a lot and then are forced to detrain or stop training completely and in some of these studies they've done this independent of anything else it's not like these people got sick from a you know a cold or flu and then had to stop training they'll just have them train a lot and then stop training and then start to look at some of the effects that occur within the brain and the major thing that I was able to extract from that literature is that after about 10 days of not doing any training that is no cardiovascular training no resistance training you start to see significant decrements in brain oxygenation levels as well as some other markers that are indicative of brain health or that would be indicative of brain health if they were to continue so if you haven't been training at all for a long period of time your brain is suffering the good news is you can start benefiting your brain very quickly by exercising check out the foundational Fitness protocol it involves a ramp up or warming kind of phase because you don't want to jump into something Whole Hog if you haven't been doing it at all if you haven't been exercising at all you know forget what you did in high school by the way folks anytime people tell you back in the day I was so fit this that that's not the way to think about it it's about today and what you're going to do today and forward okay the past is great it tells you you had a capacity but you really just want to take where you are now and try and improve where you are now going forward okay the past is the past so how fit you were in high school or in junior high school or when you were in the kindergarten class you were the first one to make it around to get the blocks and the cookie and the milk first like awesome but if you're going to start up having not exercised in a long long time think about what you can do now so you don't get injured because when you get injured you can't exercise when you don't exercise for 10 days or more that's when you start to see decrements in brain health so if you're not exercising now it's a great time to get to it if you are exercising now and you have to take a week off because of some sort of illness or injury or family event or stress look don't obsess over that don't miss out on some of the key things of life or make yourself sicker by exercising and please please please don't come to the gym sick okay I did a whole episode on colds and flu and anytime people are coughing and sneezing and they tell you they're not contagious that's completely unsubstantiated by the scientific data please don't come to the gym sick so if you had to take a week off you'll be fine you'll be fine you'll probably come back stronger in the end take a couple of days and ramp back up but after about 10 days your brain health starts to suffer so that's an important number to keep in mind okay so multiple times throughout today's discussion we've been talking about how exercise increases arousal arousal improves brain function that's true you know what's also true what's also true is that exercise improves brain health in the long term yes through the deployment of things like bdnf yes through the deployment of things like osteocalcin and on and on but it also does so by improving your sleep there are now many many studies showing that sleep is the thing that mediates many not all but many of the positive effects of exercise on brain performance and long-term brain health so what this means is that you have to make sure that you're getting adequate amounts of sleep it's not sufficient just to exercise you need to get proper sleep and I've done multiple episodes on how to optimize your sleep how to improve your sleep how to deal with insomnia shift work if you want to learn about any and all of that either from podcast or from our newsletter go to hubman lab.com put sleep into the search function and it will take you to the episodes and the newsletters that discuss that in addition if you have a specific issue with sleep like you're doing shift work or you're jet lagged or you are suffering from middle of the night waking or trouble shifting your schedule because you want to become an early riser put those terms into the search function it will take you to the specific timestamps in those episodes so that you don't have to listen to the entire episodes because I realize that some of them are quite long and of course there's the newsletter on sleep that lists off the various things that you should and can be doing to improve your sleep no matter how well you happen to be sleeping now but tons and tons of zero cost resources there in PDF form in podcast form and on and on we also did the six episode series on sleep with Dr Matthew Walker one of the world's experts in sleep so that's also there so you can find all that there one question I get a lot is let's say I don't sleep that well should I exercise well the short answer is yes provided that it was just one night of poor sleep in fact there are studies showing that if you're slightly sleep deprived meaning one night's poor sleep so most people need somewhere between six and nine hours of sleep varies by person varies by age varies by time of year and so on all discussed in that series with Matt Walker most people need six to9 hours but let's say you normally get eight or you normally get seven but you're down two hours on sleep for whatever reason should you exercise the next morning the short answer is yes provided it was just one night of poor sleep it turns out that exercising after a poor night's sleep can help offset some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation on what on brain performance and health now you don't want to get into a habit of this you don't want to get into a habit of using exercise as a way to compensate for Sleep loss so if you don't sleep well for one night exercise is a great way to offset that sleep loss effect on the brain or that would otherwise affect the brain you can compensate for it by doing some exercise keep in mind you want to exercise in a way that's not too intense because you can drive your immune system down and be more vulnerable to infections that's certainly the case after a poor night's sleep you also want to be really careful with what you do for that exercise in terms of your coordinated movement it's it's much easier to get injured when you're sleep deprived in fact there's a really nice set of studies lay Norton's talked about this elsewhere that the relationship between sleep or I should say sleep deprivation and injury is a strong one and the relationship between sleep loss and pain and failure to recover from injury is also a strong one the direct point being if you're slightly sleep deprived sure go ahead and exercise that will actually help you offset some of the negative effects of that sleep deprivation but you want to be careful how you exercise so you don't get sick and you don't get inured so you can keep in mind that if you're having trouble sleeping or even if you're a great sleeper already getting exercise will further improve the architecture of your sleep in fact there's some evidence that doing high-intensity interval training can improve the amount of deep slow wave sleep that you get and there's some additional data showing that if you do high-intensity training early in the day and that's combined with a bunch of other things that stimulate autonomic arousal so here we are again at autonomic arousal things like caffeine if that's in your program you don't have to drink caffeine things like getting bright light in your eyes early in the day definitely do that don't stare at the Sun or any light so bright that it's dangerous or painful to look at but certainly get bright light in your eyes all those things that increase autonomic arousal early in the day can also help improve the amount and the quality of sleep that you get at night in particular rapid ey movement sleep which is so critical for learning and memory in fact there's something called the first night effect which is the amount and quality of Rapid ey movement sleep that you get on the first night after trying to learn something powerfully dictates whether or not you actually learn and remember that thing because as you recall learning and memory neuroplasticity is a two-step process you need to be focused and alert during the encoding phase during the learning but it's in states of deep rest sleep in particular but also non-sleep deep rest but rapid eye movement sleep is the kind of king of reshaping your brain connections for the better unloading the emotional load of experiences that were troubling that happens during rapid eye movement sleep just a little bit of REM deprivation rapid eye movement sleep deprivation will make you more emotional and will make the painful experiences of recent and distant past also more painful get more rapid eye movement sleep if you can it also consolidates learning of things that you want to remember again exercise early in the day in particular high-intensity exercise combined with some of the other things we just discussed terrific way to improve the amount and quality of sleep that you get at night and of course all of that geysers up to what better brain health and performance in the short term and in the long term okay so I listed off the four types of training that you absolutely want to include in your exercise regimen if improving your brain health and performance is one of your goals and obviously that should be one of your goals your brain is your Central Command Center for your entire brain but also your body there's a fifth category of exercise that everyone should include if one's goal is to have a better and more resilient and indeed a better performing brain compared to your age match controls and to be direct that fifth category is the one that you absolutely don't want to do what do I mean by that well there's an absolutely beautiful literature about a brain area I've talked a little bit about this before in our episode about tenacity and willpower I've talked about it on a few other podcasts as well it came up during the podcast episode that I did with the one and only David gogins and that brain area is the anterior mid singulate cortex the anterior mid singulate cortex very briefly is a brain area that is powerfully engaged when we lean into challenges including physical challenges but also mental challenges emotional challenges and we get that I'm going to push through tenacity and engaging our willpower now it's remarkable to think about this brain area this is the brain area mind you that when my colleague at Stanford Joe parvey putting a little electrode into he was doing this for other reasons related to important neurosurgeries that patients needed and stimulated that particular brain area anterior mid singulate cortex people reported immediately feeling as if there was some impending challenge but that they were going to lean into that challenge remarkable this brain area has intense connectivity with many many other brain areas the dopaminergic system the so-called arousal system so multiple brain areas involved in arousal areas of the brain that are involved in learning areas of the brain that are involved in stress areas of the brain that are involved in lots and lots of different things it's a major hub for inputs from other brain areas and outputs to other brain areas areas but here's what's most remarkable about the anterior mid singulate cortex there's a category of humans referred to as superagers superagers are people that defy the aging process at least at the level of cognition they maintain the volume of certain brain areas well into older age when their age match counterparts are losing the same brain areas meaning people in their 60s 70s 80s 90s have brain areas that are shrinking even in cases where people don't have Alzheimer's dementia areas of the brain are shrinking superagers are people that maintain the healthy full volume of these brain areas and indeed in some cases the volume the size of these brain areas continues to increase into their later years one of the brain areas that maintains or increases volume in the superagers is the anterior mid singulate cortex and there aren't many other brain areas that do that the anterior mid singulate cortex is the main site that can be tacked to this phenomenon of super aging now super aging and super agers is a bit of a misnomer because what's happening in these people is they're not just holding on to the volume of their anterior mid singulate cortex they're also maintaining healthy cognition which is flexible strategy context dependent learning their memory their working memory they're doing phenomenally well not just for their age but even compared to some much younger people so these super agers are really interesting both for sake of what they can do into their later years and because their anterior mid singulate cortex is holding on to its size and in some cases increasing its size what can allow you to activate and increase the size of your anterior mid singulate cortex well it's very simple to do things that you don't want to do I should be very clear we're talking about things that can be done safely that aren't going to damage you physically or psychologically but we are talking about exercise or in some cases cognitive exercise but today we're talking about physical exercise that you would much rather not do so if you're like me and you love resistance training it can be hard right some days I want to do it more than others and sometimes the workouts are much harder than others but I love it but if I want to maintain and increase the size of my anterior mid singulate cortex I absolutely have to find some form of physical exercise that I would much rather not do but as I mentioned before that's also safe physically and that's not going to damage me emotionally I don't know what kind of physical exercise would damage me emotionally but you get the point this brain area has been explored in a number of different studies so successful dieters increase the size of their interor mid singulate cortex people that fail to reach a goal a diet goal or other goal experience a shrinking of their interor mid singulate cortex there's also examples of physical exercise increasing anterior mid singulate cortex skill challenges and on and on the important point is that the anterior mid singulate cortex is agnostic with respect to what you do except that it has to be something that you don't want to do if you want to build and maintain its size and that building and maintaining of the anterior mid singulate cortex size size is strongly correlated it's not necessarily causal but it's strongly correlated with this super aging phenomenon there's a wonderful review about the anterior mid singulate cortex that was authored by none other than Lisa Feldman Barrett she came up earlier in this episode she's a world-class researcher on the topic of emotions and the basis of emotions Etc the title of this paper is the tenacious brain how the anterior mid singulate cortex contributes to achieving goals and there's one figure in this paper I just want to summarize a couple of things from because it's just like a wow figure there aren't many figures like this I mean this is a review article so this figure includes panels pooling from a bunch of different studies but I'm going to just highlight a few of these by paraphrasing what's in the figure Legend okay so bear with me here I think you'll find this very interesting okay so you can't see the pictures because many people are listening to this on audio but you can certainly look up the paper we provide a link to it in the show note captions but these points are worth paying attention to spontaneous anter mid singulate cortex activity predicts grit this psychological phenomenon that we refer to as grit now this is teased out in a study of grit grit is this ability to lean into Challenge and the mere spontaneous activity right not evoked activity there's spontaneous activity which is the activity that occurs sort of naturally as a consequence of engaging in a particular thought pattern or behavior and then there's evoked activity when you stimulate a brain area this is spontaneous activity spontaneous enter mid singulate activity is associated with the psychological phenomenon the verb that we call grit and grit can be thought of as an adjective right somebody's really gritty but it should best be thought of as a verb it's the Leaning into to challenge greater anterior mid singulate cortex activity is associated with higher levels of persistence this again was teased out in a study of persistence so these aren't just philosophical statements or theoretical statements these are based on brain Imaging studies where people are being challenged with a particular set of challenges while they're in a so-called fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging machine activation of the anterior mid singulate cortex is associated with grit and with persistence and anterior mid singulate signal is associated with willingness to exert more effort if people have to exert more effort and they're willing to do that boom anterior mid singulate cortex activity goes up also anterior mid singulate activity increases get this during effort magnitude estimation even when people are just trying to gauge how much effort something's going to take that starts to initiate activity of the anterior mid singulate cortex the oh boy this is going to be a big one I got to do this and I'll explain how I engage my anid singulate cortex you'll have to decide if that's something that you hate enough so that you can use it too almost done here folks Anor mid singulate signal tracks the subjective value of effort exerted as people start to track how much effort they're exerting aner mid singulate cortex activity goes up and last but not least anterior mid singulate cortex stimulation so this is no longer spontaneous activity but stimulation increases the will to persevere incredible never before meaning never before reading this article and learning about anid singulate cortex which again is largely the consequence of work done somewhere between the years of 2010 and now 2025 did we even understand what the anterior mid singulate cortex is there for and is doing it could do other things too but this is an extraordinary set of findings and an extraordinary brain structure that everyone should know about and that's why number five on that list if you want to improve brain function and brain health over time is to do something you really don't want to do something really challenging both psychologically challenging and physically challenging at least once per week make sure it's safe psychologically and physically but do that thing for me I must confess it's deliberate cold exposure but it's deliberate cold exposure under particular conditions I'll be the first to say that I love getting into the ice bath or the cold plunge or taking a cold shower after I've been in a hot sauna for 20 or 30 minutes or after a long run where I'm sweating and I want to cool off or on a hot summer day but most of the time that's not the case meaning most of the time when I do deliberate cold exposure and sometimes I'll do it by cold shower which by the way is zero cost it'll even save you on your heating bill so you don't need to buy any equipment or you could do a cold Plunge or an ice bath but you don't need one most of the time when I even think about getting into the cold plunge or taking a cold shower that is very likely increasing my anterior mid singulate cortex activity because I love love love the heat I love sauna I'm very heat adapted I'm comfortable at very high temperatures in the sauna I don't hate the cold but I close to hate the cold so for me the First wall to get over the first bit of resistance that's really hard for me to get over is to walk towards the cold plunge then it's to take the lid off then it's to look at the thing then it's to get in but I force myself to do it I make sure that I do it safely and I make sure that I do it for about 1 to three minutes sometimes longer but I do it because yes deliberate cold exposure increases release of the so-called catacol amines dopamine epinephrine nor epinephrine also yes I know that those catacol amines are going to make me feel much better after I get out of the Cal plunge for many many hours that's been established but I also do deliberate cold exposure by cold shower or by Cold immersion because I hate it and because I know that by doing it I'm going to be activating my will to persevere my grit my willpower now today's discussion is not about deliberate cold exposure it's about exercise so what I've started doing in recent months and I'm certainly going to continue into 2025 is to start adding some form of exercise that I absolutely don't want to do in order to activate my interor mid singulate cortex now for me because my schedule is very full I'm already doing six workouts per week again some of them are shorter some of them are longer I don't have a lot of extra time to exercise I don't have a lot of time to start rolling Jiu-Jitsu for a couple hours a week which I wouldn't loath but there's a big barrier for me to do that sort of thing so maybe it's perfect for activating amcc anterior mid singulate cortex rather what I've decided to do is to include the one thing that I've been putting off for years that frankly I may enjoy down the line but that I don't enjoy currently and that's to do some sort of really coordinated specific motor activity that has to be done precisely or very precisely before you can say that you've quote unquote done it right and for me the thing that I'm selecting because I already like to jump rope and I can do a few different things with a jump rope I'm not super skilled but I can already jump rope is something that my friend Mark Bell exposed me to which is this rope flow Thing feel free to laugh if you want but this stuff is hard and it's really really cool the Rope flow involves just taking a rope okay there may be specific commercial brands of these but I was told I can just use a kind of thick rope that you buy at the hardware store or like a dog leash type rope and you can look this up online we'll provide a link to it there's a specific pattern of moving the Rope where you're not actually jumping through it so it's not jumping rope but you're actually moving it in front of and behind your body and from side to side and involves a lot of different shifting from one limb to the other in very deliberate ways and as I'm discussing this I realized that I really don't want to do this but I know it's going to be very useful for me which is exactly why I'm going to use it in 2025 to enhance my anterior mid singulate cortex activity the only fear being that I'm going to start to like it and then I'll have to find something else to engage my anterior mid singulate cortex and perhaps at that point I'll look to you guys in the comment sections to figure out what sorts of exercise I would hate the most in order to make sure that I'm getting my anterior mid singulate cortex activation because yes increased coordination is great who wouldn't want that but mainly because I want to improve my brain performance and brain function both in the short term and over time so if you want in the comment section on YouTube because that's where I can see the comments best or perhaps on Spotify as well where they now have a comment section I guess apple has a comment section too YouTube apple or Spotify put in the comment section the form of exercise that both psychologically and physically safe for you to embrace but that you would loathe to do and that you're going to perhaps no not perhaps that you're going to commit to doing in 2025 and then we can compare and contrast and we can all see which one ones we hate the most and then we can exchange which exercises we hate the most and everyone can laugh at us for doing these things that we hate and yet we'll be the ones laughing because our an mid singulate cores will be nice and plump well into our old ages and everybody else will be wondering where the comment section is thank you everybody

Title: Optimize Your Learning & Creativity With Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2025-01-02 13:00:13 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to boost creativity and enhance learning by aligning with the body’s natural rhythms and strategically using protocols to optimize states of alertness or calm.

I outline tools to improve focus and learning, including when to use specific techniques based on the time of day and how to adjust focus and tasks according to energy levels. I also discuss the two essential components of creativity and explain how to structure productive, creative work sessions. By combining biological tools — such as exercise, meals, hydration, and sleep — with subjective methods like music, I demonstrate how to tailor your approach to align with your unique biological rhythms and individual goals, fostering greater creativity and learning.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes, approximately 30 minutes, focused on key scientific and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials are released every Thursday, while full-length episodes continue to be released every Monday.

welcome to hubman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance my name is Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine let's talk about neuroplasticity more specifically let's talk about how we can optimize our brains neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to to change itself even in ways that we consciously decide now that's an incredible property our liver can't decide to just change itself our spleen can't decide to just change itself through conscious thought or through feedback from another person the cells in those tissues can make changes sure but it's our nervous system that Harbors this incredible ability to direct its own changes in ways that we believe or we're told will serve us better today's podcast is really directed toward answering your most common questions and the bigger theme of how does one go about optimizing their brain or even think about optimizing the brain what is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain in doing so I'm also going to share some of my typical routines and tools I share them because many of you have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when and so I want to open up the discussion today by emphasizing something that's fundamentally important which is that plasticity is not the goal the goal is to figure out how to access plasticity and then to direct that plasticity toward particular goals or changes that you would like to achieve let's start by talking about the different systems within the nervous system that are available for plasticity and in doing so I'll frame them in the context of what I do on a daily basis on a weekly basis and on a yearly basis first of all there are several forms of plasticity the best way I think about it is in terms of short-term medium-term and long-term plasticity short-term plasticity is any kind of shift that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day but that you don't necessarily want to hold on to Forever might say what kinds of things are those well for instance short-term plasticity might be you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight you're not feeling particularly alert and you want to use a protocol or you decide to use a protocol which could be coffee or it could be a certain form of breathing it could be some other tool to become more alert at a time of day when normally you aren't that alert but your expectation is that when you return home you will disc scarred with that the need to do that at 5:30 a.m. because you'll be asleep at 5:30 a.m. so there short-term plasticity behavioral plasticity then there's medium term plasticity for instance if you go on vacation to Costa Rica and you don't know your way around Costa Rica you want to learn the different town and the routes there but you don't have any intention of going back it's just medium- term you want to just program it in for sake of your time there and then you want to discard it most of the time when we think about or talk about optimizing the brain we're talking about long-term plasticity we're talking about the kinds of changes that people want to make so that their brain reflexively works differently long-term plasticity is almost always the Big Goal it's I want to know how to speak that language I want to be able to do that skill I want to be able to feel this way I'm going to frame all this in the context of the daily life the weekly life and the yearly life and that's because neuroplasticity and optimizing your brain rides on a deeper Foundation of this thing that governs plasticity and in fact governs all our life called autonomic arousal which is that we're asleep for part of the 24-hour cycle and we are awake almost always I've said it before but I'll say it again the trigger for plasticity and learning occurs during High Focus High alertness States not while you're asleep and the focus and alertness are both key because of the neurochemicals associated with those States but the actual rewiring and the reconfiguration of the brain connections happens during non-sleep deep rest and deep sleep so you trigger the ch change and in sleep you get the change so some of the things that we'll talk about today about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep but around the autonomic arousal system we have this system of neurons in our brain and body that's just incredible that wake us up and make us alert and when we're not accessing that system well we cannot access plasticity we cannot optimize our brain likewise if we cannot sleep well and we can't rest well we will will not access plasticity and rewire our brain because that's when the actual configuration between the connections occurs so to set this in context I wake up each day and I'll be totally honest I usually don't feel like bouncing right out of bed I wake up generally more tired and groggy than I would like because I tend to go to sleep too late what it means is that I'm not really matching my hardwired needs of going to bed probably at 8:30 or 9 and waking up at 4:00 a.m. so neuroplasticity will allow me to optimize my wakefulness but I have to do something in order to access that that and some of you may already be anticipating what I'm about to say which is oh no he's going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes in the first 30 minutes of the day I am going to tell you to do that but I'm going to also tell you two things that I've have not discussed before which relate to the plasticity between the melanops and cells these sunlight detecting bright light detecting cells in our eye and the circadian clock I've never said this before in this podcast but it turns out that the connections between these melanops and cells and the circadian clock are plastic throughout the lifespan so there's an opportunity for short-term plasticity so that's why I view sunlight first thing in the day it helps me wake up the other thing that I do is that there's a circuit that exists between the circadian clock and our adrenals that I've talked about before that triggers the release of cortisol first thing in the morning that wakes us up especially when we view light so if you're groggy in the morning that's why viewing light is helpful the other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine for the first two hours that I'm awake earlier we talked about the adenosine system and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy and caffeine suppresses adenosine it makes us feel alert and so by delaying caffeine until about 2 hours after waking I'm able to capture and reinforce to potentiate the neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock and the cortisol release in the adrenals as well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied so that I can then use the caffeine to get a natural lift in alertness and focus 2 hours later as opposed to using it just to wake myself up out of sleepiness I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning there are there's plenty of data now showing that even a slight increase in dehydration meaning just when you're lacking water can make people have headaches it can provide an some additional photophobia for those of you that are migraine prone bright light can trigger migraines that's no surprise to those of you that get headaches and migraines but dehydration can can compound the vulnerability to migraine and headache so I drink water I drink black coffee or I drink mate which is just a because I have Argentine lineage which is just a uh high caffeine drink for thing in the morning but I delay it until two hours after I wake up and that's because I want the circuits between my eye and my and my circadian clock and my adrenals to be functioning in a particular way so that then later the caffeine is an addition it adds more alertness now this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain many people who wake up quickly and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed I envy these people they will do just fine by going into a learning bout or taking care of uh whatever it is that they need to take care of sometimes that's kind more mundane tasks like email or um and whatnot here's a more or less a a rule about how the brain functions Visa Focus learning and creativity generally states of high alertness when we're very very alert are great for strategy implementation the sort of thing that we are very good at when we're well rested and we're focused and our autonomic arousal or our alertness rather as it is at a high level if you are somebody body who is hitting that alertness phase of your day very early right after you wake up that's a great time to move right into things that at least the research says you already know have the strategy and you just want to implement the strategy but for me for instance I get up I'm not terribly alert first thing and so I try and just get my brain and my thoughts organized it's not a time for me to be responding in a very linear fashion to emails or carrying out calculations that comes about 2 hours later I think um many people out there will relate midm morning is when we tend to when many people tend to achieve their peak in alertness and focus now many times I get the question and this is this what I'm about to say is directly related to the hundreds of questions I got about this should I use background music in order to learn so as a rule of thumb if you're feeling too keyed up then silence and quiet is going to be helpful in fact if you're very keyed up a particular circuit related to the basil ganglia starts getting triggered more easily it's called The Go noo circuit we have circuits that connect our forbrain to a structure in our brain called the basil ganglia which is actually a collection of structures and the forbrain which is involved in rational thought and thinking and planning and action is always trying to plan what should I do and then Implement that action and the basil ganglia are intimately involved in that discussion there's a reciprocal Loop of communication between basil gangli and cortex the basil ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex and the cortex back to the basil ganglia that facilitates go it facilitates action and the molecule the neuromodulator dopamine triggers the activation of go it tends to make us want to do more things it tends to make us biased toward action by the way that dopamine binds to something called the D1 receptor it's just a particular type of dopamine receptor for those of you that want to know the nogo pathway the pathway in the basil ganglia and cortex that suppresses action involves dopamine binding to this other receptor called the D2 receptor now D1 D2 receptors you can't just consciously decide oh I only want my D1 receptors and my D2 receptors be to be active you have to think about which sorts of states of Mind and Body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no go there are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal of alertness that bias us more toward go no go or both so here's how it works let's say I'm very alert maybe I got a particularly good night's sleep the night before I had a little too much coffee and I'm going to sit down to some work the thing to know and what I always tell myself is when I'm very alert I am very prone to go to action but I'm also prone to not no-o right I'm not going to be very good at suppressing action so those are two different things being biased toward action and being biased toward suppressing action are two different things okay so those P are push pull toward action suppress action so if I'm very alert I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action it'll be hard for me to suppress non-action but that it's very non-specific when you are very alert the best situation for learning is going to be silence it's going to be complete quiet if you are low arousal and you're tired and you're kind of sleepy a lot of people find that having some background chatter and some background noise can help Elevate their level of autonomic arousal for most people 3 hours after waking those 3 hours tends to be the period in which they're most alert throughout the day so that morning 3 hours is quite vital now many of you might ask about exercise and when into exercise in terms of rising body temperatures the it and matching body temperature to mental alertness Etc it's pretty clear that exercising early in the day not only biases us towards waking up earlier but that it also triggers the release of things like epinephrine and other neuromodulators that lend itself to a situation where we have heightened levels of arousal and mental acuity in the late morning and even into the afternoon this can be very good because if you want to restrict most of your focus learning to the early part of the day exercising early in the day does set a neurochemical context or millu for go it tends to trigger activation of the go pathway and so for those of you like myself who have a hard time kind of engaging and getting into action early in the day early morning exercise within an hour of waking and certainly no later than 3 hours after waking will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the day so in kind of reviewing what I've set up until now I do the morning light thing I delay my caffeine 2 hours after waking and then I generally try and get exercise in in the first hour or ideally within the first three hours of waking up and then I'll move into a focused learning bout if I find that I'm too alert and then I generally will tend to eat and kind of bring down my level of alertness and will continue working I typically eat my first meal right around uh midday um whether or not I've exercised or not in general I rely on a low carbohydrate meal I'll eat meat or salad or some variation of that and um nuts and fats and things like that because of the choline content for Focus I'm just going to Mar continue to March through my day and this is of course um what I experience some people are quite different but what I find is around 2: or 300 p.m. I start getting a little groggy a little bit sleepy I will tend to shift my work from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome really careful analysis is and activation of the no-o pathway around early afternoon I find I can do kind of typical more mundane tasks because those tasks require less cognitive load and they can be done more or less in an out of sequence I can answer a couple email here maybe answer that email there and then typically around 400 p.m. or so I do two things one is I make sure I hydrate and then I always do a non-sleep breast protocol sometime in the afternoon this is sometimes a 10-minute Yoga Nidra type protocol or a 30 minute Yoga Nidra type protocol and I do that because for me by about 4:30 in the afternoon I'm capable of doing basically nothing I personally find it a mistake to at that point down a double espresso and charge really hard it just doesn't work for me I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule I end up disrupting a lot of different things so for me I do the non-sleep Deep breast protocol I usually emerge from that feeling like I have a another whole day second win like I could just work work work work work and then I'll do a second bout of learning I'll do some sort of work that either involves linear um analysis of something so maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something this learning bout is very different than the than the morning one this is a work bout or learning bout that's more in the clear common Focus regime because I've come out of this non-sleep deep bre I'm not ingesting caffeine because I want to make sure that I can sleep later that night really well and this tends to be more when I do creative type work creativity is a very interesting State of Mind in which we're taking existing elements things that we already know and rearranging them in ways that are novel creativity has two parts it has a creative discovery mode where you're kind of shuffling things around in a very relaxed way and kind of being playful or exploring different configurations and then creativity also has an absolutely linear implementation mode in which you take the the idea or the design you've come up with and you create something very Ro robust and concrete and so creativity is really a two-part thing and the first part of actively exploring different configurations sometimes in a playful way sometimes in a uh in a way that's almost random and just kind of exploring that state is definitely facilitated by being relaxed and almost sleepy when you find yourself in that kind of clear Cal and focused mode creative Works tend to come about very well in the those regimes now I know that a lot of people out there rely on substances to access creative States um I'm not a marijuana User it's just not the drug for me uh for a variety of reasons I'm not a drinker it's not the not the substance for me for a variety of reasons the problem with using substance to access creativity is that generally the ones that the substances that relax people will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode but not so good at the linear implementation mode so that afternoon block is when I try and access the Freer kind of looser mindset that's associated with the fatigue that comes later in the afternoon for some of you that state that favors creativity and Creative Learning might be better in the morning I don't know you're going to have to decide for some of you you're going to be late shifted some of you are going to be morning shifted but where we have alertness generally we are good at linear implementation we're good at activating the no-go pathway and suppressing action and we're good at at pursuing particular goals and and strategy implementation and where we tend to be more relaxed and we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode so for me coming out of one of these non-sleep deep breath modes are or sleep that's when we tend to be better at novel configurations of existing elements which is creativity and this brings about a question that I get all the time which is what about psychedelics on psychedelics people report being able to smell colors or to um you know hear trees Etc and that's because there's a lot of sensory blending however that's led to the misconception that sensory blending itself is a creative process there's nothing creative about sensory blending the essence of a creative process is new ways of configuring things that lend themselves to a bigger bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding on the part of the Observer and just sensory blending is not going to accomplish that now I think that there may come a time and certainly there are clinical trials that are happening now where psychedelics are leveraged toward particular clinical goals these are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present that is authorized to do that that can help people through depression trauma Etc so all of this is to say that no I don't take psychedelics to access creative States that's not where I think the major role the important role of psychedelics might show up if it's going to for Humanity I think that it may have these important roles in the clinical context provided it's done legally and safely I think that that the creative process being a two-stage process means that I am personally best served by having this period of nonlinear EXP ation of Concepts whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon but then I'll actually shove that work I'll just set it aside and then I'll revisit it the next day or even the next day to see whether or not the the work itself is ready for deliberate linear implementation which I would want to do during one of these high highly focused States so the long and short way of saying this is that when we're very alert do linear type of operations when we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed that's when when creative Works can first be conceived but their implementation requires high levels of alertness now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening now I am as I've mentioned before I'm a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well by getting light in the evening it accomplishes two things for me first of all it makes sure that I don't get up too early that I'm not waking up at 3:00 or 4: in the morning because it's going to shift my clock it's going to delay it a little bit and so this is really important if you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine on a regular 24-hour cycle and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness drifting all over the place and you want some predictability to how your mind is going to work in order to optimize learning and performance well then you need to get Morning Light and evening light the morning light is going to advance my clock make my system want to get up earlier and the evening light is going to delay my clock a little bit so that on average it kind of bookends my circadian mechanisms and basically want to go to sleep at more or less the same time each night and wake up more or less at the same time each morning that's how it works and that's a hardwired mechanism that's not some subjective thing that I tell myself that's a hardwired mechanism so that gets us to the evening and generally in the evening I'll get that light by going outside and then I'll start to dim them for the evening because as I've mentioned many times before and I'm not going to belabor the point you want to minimize your light exposure especially overhead bright light exposure in in the evening from about 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. so for me it screens off it's um dim lights and that's what favors a falling asleep in a good night's sleep for me since we were talking about food earlier I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before my evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate Rich so I'm not one of these people that's keto or high high meat only or anything like that remember fasting and low carbohydrate States facilitate alertness carbohydrate rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness they stimulate the release of tryptophan and the transition to sleep I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates and it also replenishes glycogen the next piece of scientific data that I'm going to describe is a very important piece of scientific data for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain and access sleep it also can help avoid a lot of anxiety issues the peak output of the circadian clock for wakefulness in other words the peak of our wakefulness and the suppression of the sleep signal actually happens very late in the day so we have this trough of activity and and body temperature is lowest right before waking then as we wake up our body temperature goes up and into the afternoon it continues to go up up up up up and then it tends to fall in the evening and towards bedtime but there's a brief blip of release of peptides and other substances from the from the Sleep Centers in the brain that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness about an hour before bedtime now that's often the time when people start stressing about the fact that they have something to do the next day and they worry about not being able to sleep and it can Cascade into a whole set of things I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity and I don't worry about it I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day but basically I just go through if I'm going to do anything it's going to be very mundane task like cleaning or things that require almost zero effort and that probably speaks to my cleaning ability too I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10:30 11 and if all goes well I stay asleep for four or 5 hours typically it's 3 or4 and then I wake up what it probably reflects is that the real time meaning the time that I should go to sleep is probably closer to 8:00 the word midnight was literally supposed to mean midnight we were meant to go to sleep and wake up with the setting and rising of the Sun so I think that's the natural pattern and we've just deviated from it with artificial lights so waking up at 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. doesn't necessarily mean that there's something screwed up about you what it likely means is that you were supposed to go to bed much earlier and because of this asymmetry in the autonomic nervous system where it's much easier for us to push and to delay our sleep time than it is to accelerate our wakeup time in other words it's easier to stay up and hang out at the party even if you don't want to be there than it is to wake up when you're exhausted and you're fast asleep most people are pushing through into the late hours of the even evening and night and going to bed much later than they naturally would want to and so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8:00 p.m. a lot of good things happen between 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. and so I want to enjoy those and I push through the the evening hours but as a consequence I'm running out of melatonin my melatonin release is basically subsided by about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and so it makes sense that I would wake up if I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm anxious for whatever reason and my mind is looping I have a couple rules one one is I don't trust anything I think about when I wake up in the middle of the night any of it there's just nothing either for me terribly creative or worth linear implementation at that time but one thing that has been very helpful is to sometimes do one of these non-sleep deep breast protocols as a way to go back into sleep those for me have been very useful at helping me turn off kind of looping thinking in the middle of the night and fall back asleep in reviewing my schedule for you just as a context for how to implement certain types of tools for optimizing learning realize that it gives the impression that there's a 90-minute bout of learning and work in the morning and then a 90-minute bout of creative type work in the afternoon and that's it there are a lot of hours in between of course and I just want to be very clear those hours for me are occupied by pretty um not mundane tasks but things that are are kind of random those are things like email or attending to zoom meetings or um meeting with colleagues and students and things of that sort I mention those two 90-minute bouts because those are the two 90-minute bouts where I'm trying to expand on the mental capacities that I already have they're really where I'm trying to stretch and grow what I'm able to do on a regular basis reflexively and so for many of you out there who are in school or have family demands or other demands the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments of about 90 minutes one or two or maybe more per day you're trying to slot those in wherever you can amidst your other obligations and things that you need to do but you want to do that in an intelligent way that's anchored to your biology and then you want to do a number of things which I've talked about today in order to optimize those sessions to get the most out of them I think the way to look at any tool to modulate or measure the nervous system is ask whether or not it's going to move you up or down the state of autonomic arousal whether or not it's going to make you more alert or more calm more focused or less focused that's kind of the the two axes here that we need to think about I think the subjective reading of whether or not one is alert or calm and whether or not that alertness or calmness matches the goal or the thing that we're trying to achieve in terms of learning including sleep is the most valuable internal tool and recognition that we can all have but ultimately it's about tailoring that alertness and calmness to the specific types of learning and activities that you are going to do do and perform and it's reciprocal meaning some of those activities like exercise early in the day will increase your level of autonomic arousal and alertness certain foods will tend to wake you up certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy and the volume of food and the timing of food is a factor also so it's a huge parameter space it's a huge set of variables that impacts whether or not we're feeling well performing well learning great or not learning great and the key thing is to become an observer of your own system and what works for you and to recognize that there are two bins of tools for optimizing learning and brain performance one are tools that are really anchored in biological mechanism and we are certain of what those are I've talked about some of those the other are the more subjective tools for some of you visualization might work terrifically well for some of you one song might really wake you up because of the associations you have with it and for me I might just you know it might repel me from the room because I don't like it or it might put me to sleep sleep but of course volume is kind of a universal loud music tends to wake people up soft music doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much so part of today is really getting you to think about in a scientific way in a structured way about the non-negotiable elements which are that you're going to have a period of every 24-hour cycle when you tend to be more awake and a period when you tend to be more asleep and how to leverage those so you're not fighting an uphill battle to wake up when you're actually would want to be and and should be sleepy and not trying to go to sleep when you are naturally you know going to be most awake so a lot of it is really anchors back to those core mechanisms of biology and then you start layering on the different Protocols of food and supplementation Etc and I think it's important to recognize that some people are just more go go go go go and no go and some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action in an activity it's just the way that we're wired some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm States and so that there are people like that too and so you have to know where you are and what particular goals you're trying to pursue as always thank you for your interest in science [Music]

Description:
My guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, out now, is Dr. Jordan Peterson. We discuss the psychology and neuroscience of human drives, sustaining motivation, choosing a direction and vision for one’s life, and the guideposts within philosophy, culture, and religion that can help us select and navigate the best possible path.

It’s a serious discussion that includes deep dives into topics such as addiction, relationships, politics, and how we need to organize our internal and external lives to become the best versions of ourselves—for the sake of our own happiness and to better serve others.

Here, Jordan refers to the immensely powerful results that come from simply organizing one’s physical space and the ramifications it has on our internal landscape. He explains how this can cascade to positively impact our thinking, emotions, and behavior.

Our conversation is grounded in research data and practical tools that people of all ages and genders should find useful.

In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jordan Peterson, Ph.D., psychologist, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, best-selling author, and prominent online educator. We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. 

We also explore the innate human drive to create "impact at a distance" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time. 

Listeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Jordan Peterson Dr Jordan Peterson is a psychologist an author and one of the most influential public intellectuals of our time today we discuss the human animal what it means to be a human being at the level of psychology ology at the level of Neuroscience and indeed at the level of expression of different personality types within us most of us don't think about having different personalities however as we discuss today due to the activity of specific brain circuitries including the hypothalamus the prefrontal cortex and others we each and all can adopt different states of mind that powerfully influence our emotions our thoughts and our actions and in so doing we are different people depending on those states of mind today's discussion is both an intellectual one and a practical one you will learn where and how to place your thoughts you will learn the relationship between the Call to Adventure and responsibility and as Dr Peterson emphasizes in his new book we who wrestle with God he emphasizes the use of story in this case biblical stories to understand oneself and to best guide one's actions towards the most positive and generative outcomes we discuss the self romantic relationships and commitments the family community and culture we also discuss the media politics cancel culture things like social media and pornography shifting masculine and feminine roles and the innate human drive to create action at a distance both in space and in time today's discussion is both intellectual and practical Dr Peterson emphasizes how to use different sources of story philosophy Psychology and Neuroscience to understand and best guide one's decision making process indeed he discusses the tight relationship between the Call to Adventure and responsibility as a trustable framework from moving forward in life towards One's best possible outcomes and I'm certain that by the end of today's discussion you will be thinking about your own neural circuits that is the connections in your brain that drive emotions thoughts and behavior as well as your psychology your different states of mind and you are going to have a number of different tools and Frameworks with which to apply all that knowledge toward the best possible outcomes before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 grams of protein only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar that's right 28 gram of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein These Bars from David also taste amazing my favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough but then again I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one and I also like the cake flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're incredibly delicious for me personally I strive to eat mostly Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a high quality protein source with David I'm able to get 28 gam of protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and it allows me to do that without taking in excess calories I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon or even midafternoon if I want to bridge that gap between lunch and dinner I like that it's a little bit sweet so it tastes like a tasty snack but it's also giving me that 28 grams of very high quality protein with just 150 calories if you would like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is davidpro docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in both your short and long-term health is your body's ability to manage blood glucose or blood sugar to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or crashes I first started using levels about 3 years ago as a way to understand how different foods impacted my blood glucose levels and it's proven incredibly informative for determining my food choices when I eat specific foods and how I time eating relative to things like my workouts both weight training and cardiovascular training things like running and when to eat before I go to sleep to allow for the most stable blood sugar throughout the night indeed using levels has helped shape my entire schedule so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself you can go to levels. link huberman levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now they're also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. link spelled l i n k/ huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership and now for my discussion with Dr Jordan Peterson Dr Jordan Peterson welcome thank you sir delighted to have you here and want to talk about elements within your new book yeah also some elements within your previous books and within that mind of yours generally as a framework for that I'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit a little bit of a discussion about sort of brain and psychology um just kind of lay the groundwork for where we might um prod some of the themes that you bring up related to the book so I view the brain as obviously a bunch of cells and parts Etc but I distill it down to some basic features first of all we have an autonomic physiology I think we'd both agree on that that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness our breathing our heart rate stuff that runs in the background and then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to what I would call impulses things that we desire we want to move toward repetitive behaviors and we also have some impulses to avoid things that are putrid painful Etc that's all in there like it is in other we should talk about the idea of impulse in relationship to that characterization okay yeah because there's an important there's an important point to be made on the there you pay a price for characterizing that as impulse and and I'd like to explore that with you because it's crucial great we'll Circle back to impulse I'd like to do that and then we have a lot of circuitry people will hear about it as executive function prefrontal circuitry which does many things but I like to think of um as a circuit that can say and here I'm borrowing from a previous guest who's a neuro surgeon it can say sh or exert what's called top- down suppression on these what I'm calling impulses it can we should talk about that too the suppression idea and the inhibition idea in general great because there's I think there's a parallel problem there to the notion of impulse that's very much worth delving into great yeah so circuitry that's devoted to our ability to self- inhibit the desire to reach for something or to avoid something we can push ourselves into things that would otherwise be aversive we can avoid doing things that would otherwise drive us to quote unquote just do it anyway and then we have what I think of as our default settings kind of how we're operating in the world with respect to food other people ourselves our thoughts if we don't intervene with ourselves and these default settings are of course established by both nature a genetic program that wires up circuitry but also Nur because of the immense neuroplasticity that occurs in the first 25 years plus of life but especially those first years of life and then of course we have neuroplasticity this incredible gift that humans have more of than any other species as far as we know which is we can decide to make changes now the reason I lay out this framework as opposed to starting with a question is because there are so many amazing questions that you ask in this book you know we who wrestle with God I mean trying to wrap our arms in Minds around this huge set of questions and it occurred to me just step back from all of that and ask is part of the reason that we have a concept of God that there are multiple religions is that the consequence of Some Humans at some point realizing or perhaps God himself realizing that what we are equipped with as humans which we just described is insufficient to allow us to to evolve as a species and be the best version of ourselves I think this for me really is like the central question of at least my life which is to what extent do I need to intervene with my default settings rewire them engage that prefrontal cortex and you know push down on some repetitive or aversive behaviors and to what extent can we do that maybe and to what end and to what end and maybe we need a rule book uh you know I I am starting to believe and I'm now 49 years old that we need a rule book that the neural circuitry that's encased within our skulls is not sufficient to allow us to navigate through life our best we kind of know that we need a rule book even you you admitted that in some ways implicitly when you discussed the fact that we have a 25 years socialization window and what that means is that we have to interact with other people and our traditions in order to set us right and that's so complex it takes 25 years and so we're learning something from that and that's indication that our let's say default biological settings are insufficient to guide us into the future right and so then the question is well what is it that you're learning as a consequence of that socialization process and you can think about it and people have thought about it as a a series of complex inhibitions of lower order motivational States impulses but I'm not very happy with the inhibition model because inhibition is unsophisticated socialization integration is sophisticated socialization so here here's a way of I really learned this I think from contrasting Freud with P because Freud's model super ego is really an inhibition model and Freud was a neurologist P's model was very different he thought of the properly socialized person as someone who had integrated their lower order we'll call them impulses for now into a sustainable voluntary structure that regulated them and gave them all their proper place that's very different than an inhibitory model so for example I'll give you an example from my own life my son was quite an um willful young child wonder where he got it from yeah well fair enough and and my father was you know a formidable character and so my son liked to do what he liked to do and it took him it took quite a bit of tussling with him to help him I wouldn't say inhibit that or regulate to integrate it and one of the consequences of that was he became a very good athlete and so why is that relevant well because it wasn't like he stopped being assertive or even aggressive it's that he learned how to put that aggression in its proper place in relationship to a goal that was much more sophisticated than merely getting his own way moment to moment okay so integration is a better like a a very sophisticated athlete a team athlete in particular isn't not aggressive and they're not inhibiting their aggression on the playing field they may now and then when they're provoked let's say but all things considered what they've done is subordinate their aggression to a higher order goal that enables them to be more successful but also to be successful in a maximally social and sustainable way and PJ's point and he's absolutely right about this is that that's much better conceptualized as integration and then with regard to impulse because I said I would return to that I I spent a lot of time walking through the behavioral literature right and a lot of that was derived from animal experiments and it was predicated on the idea that if you could explain something on the basis of a deterministic reflex you should and there's some there's something to be said for that hypothesis don't make your theory any more complex than it needs to be how far can you get with with a theory of chain reflexes a deterministic theory the behavior has gone a long way they couldn't get to the highest strata of human endeavor with a chained reflex Theory but there was a lot of things they did that were very good but one of the things they made a big mistake about was to conceptualize motivational States let's say as impulses or drives that's not sufficient because it fails to take into account the effect of those States on perception so it's much better to think of a motivated State this is what helped me integrate behavioral Theory with psychoanalytic theory especially the the psychoanalytic theory of religious Endeavor it's much better to think of those lower order motivational States as personalities their subpersonalities they have their perceptions they have their objects of perception they have their uh cognitive rationalizations you certainly see that in addiction let's say they have their emotions like they are small personalities unidimensional very narrow-minded personalities but they're personalities they're not impulses so are they personalities within our what most people would think of as our larger personality I mean what I'm hearing is that let's say somebody's an addict it depends on how integrated you are because you could be nothing but a succession of dominion of subpersonalities that's what a 2-year-old is right and so you have to build an integrating personality on top of those subpersonalities but not in a manner that inhibits them that means your socialization is in unsophisticated even Freud knew this because even though he had basically an inhibitory model of say super ego regulation um he believed that a healthy personality would have the impulse of aggression and the impulse of sexuality to take two major lower order motivational States into account would have them integrated into the functioning ego the the issue is integration and so what you're doing when you're social like okay when when my son for example would become willful in a manner that I regarded as counterproductive for him and the household and and the rule would be you can't act that way because if you act that way people aren't going to approve of you and that's a bad plan so you have to you have to control that because it's not going to work out well for you if you don't okay so I use timeout now timeout is an effective disciplinary strategy for social creatures because we don't like isolation and so timeout basically takes child puts the child in isolation that produces a pain like response because social isolation produces pure inhibition right well well that's the question you see that's the question he had to inhibit his immediate desire say to run around because he was going to sit on the steps but see the I put a rule in place there and the rule was as soon as you get yourself under control you can leave the stairs okay so now the question is what does under control mean one interpretation is inhibition another interpretation is no no he's developing a superordinate personality probably cortically that has enough Dominion so that those underlying motivational states can now be integrated and placed properly into a hierarchy and when I'm insisting that he regulate his behavior and I allow him to move off the step when he is now able to be a social creature again instead of falling prey to his whim I'm reinforcing the cortical integration of those underlying motivational States now you might think the human organism is comes into the world with with a a Waring battleground of primordial motivational States that's per perfectly reasonable view we know a lot of that is mediated by the hypothalamus for example the AMD and these lower order biologically what pre-programmed to some degree pre-programmed systems now the specific manner in which those systems should find their expression and the specific way that they're going to be hierarchically integrated is going to depend to a tremendous degree on the particulars of the society at that moment which is why you need that 18-year framework to to hone the manner in which those systems make themselves manifest but the I think the best way to conceptualize that is that it's it's the hierarchical integration of the motivational States within an overarching superordinate personality and that personality is not bound to the moment it takes the medium and long-term into account and it's not self-serving like a 2-year-old would be because you have to take other people into account if you're going to be successful so you and this is where the cortex comes in as far as I'm concerned this is what it's doing it's stretching the it's integrating the lower order temporally Bound motivational states that are specifically self-serving to a much broader vision of the world that takes the future into account and other people and and that's that's hard it's very hard I I love this and I'll tell you why um because the way that I think of the prefrontal cortex is that its main job is context dependent strategy setting right context dependent context dependent that's a crucial issue and you mentioned hypothalamus this you know it's basically the size of you know two uh marbles or so sitting above the roof of our mouth tiny tiny little brain area it's mostly switches in there what do I mean by that anytime a neurosurgeon is stimulated neurons in a little sub area of the hypothalamus you get either Rage or sexual appetite or mating with inanimate objects I mean this was done in both non-human primates and in hum uncontrollable thirst uncontrollable thirst hunger total ression of hunger I mean all the basic drives are operating in they like swies and prefrontal cortex has direct access to it to the hypo hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex is context dependent learning context dependent decision- making and I love that you brought in this notion of changing an Impulse in the example that you gave in your son's impulse to be aggressive or wild in some way that was inappropriate for the home environment at that moment and two things that you said uh really resonate the prefrontal cortex his prefrontal cortex had to learn that whatever he was feeling for himself his own desires needed to be placed in the context of other people's wishes desires and needs as well so there's an even for him to thrive right it's not merely a sacrifice of his own desire for the sake of others it's like no no look kid if you're we know this if you're if you have the same orientation towards other people at four that you did with you were twoo especially if you're tilted a little in the aggressive Direction you will not make friends and you will be isolated and alienated for the rest of your life so that 2-year-old impulsiveness that has its place two it starts to modify radically at three and it better be fixed by four and the reason for that is that you have to integrate yourself into the social World which means in the case of children it means well you want to have friends and so the reason you're you're you're disciplining your child isn't to teach them that what they're doing is bad you know in that simple in in that simple sense that you might interpret punishment it's like no you need to be more sophisticated well why well you have to be able to take turns well why well because you no one like you otherwise well what's the problem with that well first of all we're hyp social like you can punish Psychopaths by putting them in isolation that's how social human beings are you take the most antisocial human beings there are and you can punish them by making them be alone right so that's how social we are so you want to you you're you're modeling for your child a strategy of of even satisfaction for his own basic drives that takes context in the most sophisticated possible way into account right and that is see as soon as you understand that that's the fostering of like a meta personality in the child which would really be the personality of that child the integrated personality you start to understand how that might be related to religious thinking because religious thinking is the attempt to formulate something approximating an ideal personality right now that's attributed there that's often attributed elements of the Divine but there's reasons for that that we could go into but as soon as you know that the basic structure even at the lower motivational level is personality well then that that changes the way you view the brain look a lot of archaic deities are motivational systems could you give me an example the God of War Mars that's rage that was a God that the Vikings invoked before they went into battle they would use Ammon muscaria and they imitated Predators right from an early age this is a aceto Coline by the way folks has two general receptor systems the nicotinic system which is a stimulant but also relaxes you that's that's why people like nicotine um and then the muscarinic system which um creates uh uh changes in our self-perception and perception of the things around us um it's not so much a stimulant as it um it's a I would Veer towards almost like a psychedelic or an it has a a um an effect of making us less fearful and um and intrigued it's a radically atypical psychedelic yeah it's hard to describe hard to describe it's outside the the LSD cybin masculine domain so people would take this this as an agent the Vikings would take this as an agent going into sure because what they were trying to do is make the personality of Rage superordinate with no pain right and they practiced that from a very early age so the Vikings worked themselves up they went berser that means to wear the be shirt right they transformed themselves so to speak into Predators they would narrow the context within which their um I'm calling them impulses but you're giving a more sophisticated explanation for them within which their the aggressive impulse the strategically aggressive impulse could be channeled right full rain give full rain right they were experts at that to be able to decapitate people eviscerate people do whatever it was that they needed to do in order to win and and to suppress their own feelings of pain yeah well then you could imagine in a way that what they were doing was bringing the full resources of the cortex to and placing them at the service of the rage circuits in the hypothalamus like we have no idea what that would be like no there aren't we don't do that we have no idea what a human being who does that is like if they're expert at it you uh you it would give you nightmares to think about it deeply there there's an experiment if I may um that might shed some light on what it would look like uh um a former guest on this podcast actually um David Anderson at Caltech has been studying hypothalamic circuits and he and his former postto da Lynn discovered a small tiny tiny collection of neurons in the ventromedial hyp Thalamus that when stimulated would send these animals these mice you can find videos of this online into a rage now the interesting thing is is it required the presence of another mouse right right and right so it's still somewhat context depend somewhat context dependent if they were alone in their cage they wouldn't attack themselves or the walls of the cage but if you put a air or water-filled glove within the cage they would absolutely attack it to try and destroy it then you turn off these neurons the the mouse is Cal we can put link to this in the show note caption now here's what's remarkable the ventromedial hypothalamus has these neurons basically interspersed with other neurons that when stimulated suppress rage and activate copulation incredible right within the same structure you have these mutually exclusive sets of of neurons and behaviors and it and it speaks to I think some of the things that uh Freud and and others have talk about in terms of the the juxtaposition of of these neurons but um that they they mutually inhibit one another which lends itself to some really interesting questions about um when those two when uh aggression and sexuality become become combined in in states of pathology okay so but in any event um it so context dependent control over impulses over the hypothalamus seems to be the theme here and the other thing that that you mentioned is the ability for your son in this case but presumably also the Vikings to be able to broaden their temporal scope to be able to think about the time domain differently this is something I'm absolutely obsessed by the more we experience what I brought up at the beginning was that we have this autonomic arousal system the more alert we are the less we are able to take ourselves into um Notions of this two shall pass the past the present and the future it tends autonomic activation stress Panic fear anger tend to make us lose sight we we get blinders on lose sight of the fact that there was a past there's a present and there's a future well that's because they're collapsing they're collapsing your domain of of apprehension to the moment so you will act you have to collapse to the moment to act right and so we should also point out for everyone that the other you don't want to underestimate the sophistication of the hypothalamus and this is partly why conceptualizing its various States as subpersonalities is so useful I mean it's it's not unsophisticated you can take a female cat and take out its whole brain except for the hypothalamus so it's like 990 5% of its brain is gone and in a relatively controlled environment it's indistinguishable from a normal cat it can in it can do cat things and live now it it's h and it's hyper exploratory now that's a that's a very strange thing where is a cat with no brain is hyp exploratory it's not what you'd think at all but it it shows you how sophisticated the hypothalamus is it can run these programs but they're programs of Personality because they have perceptions it can run them and it and it it's and it can do that quite successfully now all the higher order subcortical and cortical systems are well I think they are to your point their ways of expanding the apprehension of those fundamental motivational systems across broader and broader spans of time incorporating more and more people but also solving the problem of the conflict that emerges between those fundamental motivational States right it's like well what do you do when you're hungry and tired right well you have to mediate between the states to some degree what do you do if you want to solve the problem of being hungry and tired of over a long period of time with other people right well you need more and more brain to calculate that right and so a huge part of what maturation is is when we think about it as the capacity to forego gratification actually what's happening is that as you mature and your cortex comes online let's say you're able to regulate your behavior with more more and more other things taken into account right right and you know that there has to be some War there which is why you're wrestling with god let's say there has to be some War there because it's also the case that you do have to satiate yourself in relationship to your basic biological needs or you die and so there's going to be tension that is something like the tension between the individual and the group you might say that's how the Russians or the freudians would think about it so the weird thing about that is that it's not useful to to identify your individuality with the Dominion of a whim and that's what hedonists do and that's what immature people do they think well why shouldn't I get what I want it's like I see so your claim is that the you that superordinate is what you want that isn't that means you're subjugated to these low order personalities and you might say well why why is that wrong it's like well you're a 2-year-old it doesn't work you know if if it's all about you and your immediate gratification well first of all you're rather Psychopathic because you could think of psychopathy as the extension of immaturity into adulthood that's a pretty good default way of conceptualizing it it's like it's an unsophisticated strategy they want what they want now regardless and they don't care about the the we or the future fure see see one this is one of the ways I caught a to this relationship was I what because I studied antisocial behavior for a very long time psychopaths in particular are notorious for their inability to learn from experience okay so what does that mean it means that if they do something impulsive that causes them trouble in the future the fact of that future trouble has no bearing on their continued Behavior well what that means is that they are so non communitarian that they're willing to even betray their own future selves there's no difference between that betraying someone else it's exactly the same mechanism very much a toddler toddler well so here's something I learned in Montreal I worked with a man named rishard Tromblay there and rishard I think Richard's lab used up one-third of all social science funding for Quebec at one time he was radically successful researcher and he was really interested in antisocial behavior and and was trying to get to the roots and one of the conclusions that our lab Enterprise mve towards was that one observation was that if you take two-year-olds if you take kids at different ages you could imagine you made a group of two-year olds threey olds group of foury olds all the way up to 15 you just let them interact the two-year-olds are the most aggressive and but if you analyze the two-year-olds themselves you find that all the aggressive kids are boys and it's only a fraction of them about 5% so if you group two year olds together 5% of the boys will kick steal hit and bite which was our definition of early onet antisocial Behavior almost all of those kids are socialized by the age of four right the remnant that aren't get alienated because they have no friends and they're the ones who become juvenile delinquents and then early onset criminals and then repeat of offenders right and so what it is is imagine there's some kids whose default their rage circuits are a little bit more dominant than the typical kid they're often bigger physically yeah especially the bite the biting I uh forgive me for interrupting but there's a very interesting paper published about two years ago showing that there's a specific circuit from the hypothalamus to the neurons that control uh jaw closure that are independent of the neurons that control jaw jaw closure for eating and for drinking that are specifically for aggressive biting I mean I hope people understand the significance of this because what this means is there are dedicated circuits for aggressive biting in your hypothalamus we all learn to suppress these except probably under conditions where our life is endangered in which case you'd probably bite like hell in order to try and get out of that circumstance but we are all born with this circuit we die with this circuit most of us apparently not these kids learn to suppress the circuit right right or integr an 8-year-old B is a scary thing a one-year-old biter is like a a little bit of a worrisome thing a 2-year-old like okay we need to work on this an 8-year-old berer people are starting to be concerned I think even without knowledge of the Psychopathology literature one would be very concerned if their eight-year-old is biting other kids not just because of the damage induced but it's so very different and so much more primitive than than even hitting or spitting or something exactly it's it's the indication of a virtual absence of sophisticated socialization they are truly in their hypothalamus yeah yeah right exactly and that's well especially if you have a hypothalamus that's tilted towards rage let's say and and defensive or predatory aggression that's bad news now so so so so what's the what's the upshot of that well the upshot is that there is a sub that's right there's a subset of kids whose whose default reactions aren't socialized and we associate that with psychopathy and long-term criminality there's a really useful thing to understand that much of what we see as pathology and I would say the same thing about narcissism and and and certain forms of Hedonism essentially what it is is failure of socialization right and this has very interesting political implications because it also implies that imagine that impulsive self-gratification is a personality the desire for impulsive self-gratification is a personality with its own political opinions nche said in the late 1800s that every Drive attempts to philosophies in its Spirit brilliant a brilliant observation far different than conceiving of the say hypothalamic drives as deterministic chains of only impulses and another thing to consider too with regards to the effect of hypothalamic motivation on perception that mouse that you talked about who's attack system is activated electronically see when that glove is dropped you can see that there's a relationship with perception because if there's no target for attack that's biologically relevant in the environment there's no impulse so you could imagine that what happens is when you activate those neurons is that there's a set of perceptual stimuli that are much more likely to be classified as a defeatable enemy now even a glove will do it right right so you drop in a glove and that's now per ceed as defeatable enemy or perhaps threat because we don't know exactly what the perception would be but then you see then it's the perception driving the behavior that's not an Impulse right right that's more like a strategy and that's it's un I really started to understand some of the literature on the evolution of religious thinking when I started to understand motivational States as personalities because one of the things that you see this is so cool something I tried to talk to Dawkins about the the greatest historian of religions who ever lived was mer eliad and he wrote a sequence of brilliant books um the sacred and the profane is the best one to start with very short book very elegant book and what ilad documented across the world was the pattern by which polytheistic belief systems turned into monotheistic belief systems that parallels maturation it's the same thing and so the polytheistic Gods tend to be rep representations of of motivational States I I I'm going to pause you there because I think this is extremely important um so the god of war or the god of love the goddess of love or the god of love exactly exactly that um so the idea that the different gods are the uh reflective of different let's just let's just we'll just say it as as neuroscientists as different hypothalamic and and related circuits well why wouldn't they be Gods you know beware of falling under their minion beware of becoming their play things and the other thing that's very interesting you see is that you have to also understand that these don't exist independently of historical context so let's say rage it's like there's a there's a there's a literature of Rage there's a culture of Rage there are patterns of Rage that are played out in drama and literature like it's not only that the motivational impulse is a personality it's a personality with a history and a philosophy and if you don't think think it can possess you you don't know very much about possession so like for example if you're fighting with someone and you and you become enraged as you said your temporal purview shrinks and your notion of what constitutes Victory is radically transfigured so if you're fighting with someone you love you might want to defeat them or even hurt them independently of the fact that you actually love them well then you think well you're you're gripped by these impulses no no you're inhabited by the spirit of Rage and if you're a sophisticated person there's going to be an endless stream of sophisticated intellectual rationalizations that come along with that possession right it's full-fledged personality and it's one of the things you see with people who are psychotic you know who drift off into the landscape of their imagination is that they dwell on such states of possession so for example these kids that shoot up High School like they're fantasizing under the influence of rage and resentment for thousands of hours that just takes control of them and it's not it's not a simple impulse it's like no they've they've inverted the you could think they've inverted the neurological order and the god of rage is now the what would you say the leading personality of integration or the god of resentful rage even worse and the circuit May R run in reverse my colleague David Spiegel at who's our uh Vice chair of Psychiatry at Stanford has done some beautiful experiments examining the relationship between uh prefrontal cortical areas and the insula a brain area that has a map of our internal body State interoception you know our ability to sense our internal workings Etc in any event there are certain conditions including depression where the direction of flow between the prefrontal cortex and the insula literally reverses it's like running against the typical traffic this is a very different example because here you're presenting in the context of Rage or and sociopathy and and these kids who um shoot up schools but I do absolutely subscribe to what you just said that if one drops into one of these more primitive States and emotions and all the things that go with it for a very long time it's almost as if um the governor which is the prefrontal cortex starts to become the Govern that the whole circuit starts to run from bottom up as opposed to top down yeah yeah defin and I think there's good neurological that's what happens in addiction mhm right so you hit you hit that circuit that's seeking the drug with repeated doses of dopamine you know people say they have a monkey on their back it's like no they have a monster in their brain and it's and they grew it and it grows because it's reinforced with dopaminergic hits and as it grows its capacity to dominate increases and so when there's a cue for the addiction this is why people relapse when they get out of a treatment center they'll go back to their normal environment after having dealt with the physiological withdrawal let's say and acute craving will make itself manifest like a friend they Freebase with and it's all of a sudden that monster is alive and it just shuts everything else down and it's got a personality it can lie you know one of the Hallmarks of adictive behavior is lying and the lies are the rationalizations of that subcircuit subpersonality for its own pathological behavior and so and that's all reinforced too by the dope and energic hits it's like there's multiple people in there in in everyone one of the most incredible polytheistic paganism polytheistic yeah that's the default condition right right that's the condition of the 2-year-old I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor ag1 ag1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast the reason I started taking ag1 and the reason I still take ag1 is because it is the highest quality and most complete foundational nutritional supplement what that means is that ag1 ensures that you're getting all the necessary vitamins minerals and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation for your daily Health ag1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support a healthy gut microbiome your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that line your digestive tract and impact things such as your immune system status your metabolic Health your hormone health and much more so I've consistently found that when I take ag1 daily my digestion is improved my immune system is more robust and my mood and mental focus are at their best in fact if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I'm excited to share that Roa and I have teamed up to create a new style of red lens glasses these red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening after the sun goes down they filter out short wavelength light that comes from screens and from LED lights the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used as overhead and frankly lamp lighting nowadays I want to emphasize Roa red lens classes are not traditional blue blockers they're not designed to be worn during the day and to filter out blue light from screen light they're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths that suppress melatonin secretion at night and that can alter your sleep so by wearing Roa red lens glasses they help you calm down and they improve your transition to sleep most nights I stay up until about 10: p.m. or even midnight and I wake up between 5:00 and 7:00 a.m. depending on when I went to sleep now I put my Roa red lens glasses on as soon as it gets dark outside and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep which makes sense based on everything we know about how filtering out shortwave lengths of light can allow your brain to function correctly Roa red lens glasses also look cool frankly you can wear them out to dinner or to concerts or out with friends so it turns out it is indeed possible to support your biology to be scientific about it and to remain social after all if you'd like to try Roa go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout one of the most remarkable real life examples I've ever witnessed of the power of belief in God I'm just going to say it as as it occurred uh I have a good friend um who for many years struggled with alcohol and drug addiction of multiple kinds incredibly kind person incredibly successful in his career married two beautiful children multiple relapses yeah crashed his truck at 7 in the morning after getting intoxicated at 6:30 in the morning got out of that one happened again and again multiple rehab centers of the sort of standard treatment Etc and then ultimately enough happened within that whole set of circumstances that his wife said you know this is it you've got to solve this or we just can't be with you very scary situation for everybody involved including him who absolutely adored his family he told us uh his friends that he was going to go to a a a center here in Los Angeles that treats addiction with essentially religion a belief in God he was already fairly religious um most most Sundays he attended church and things of that sort and you can imagine we all thought including myself like okay dude like good luck yeah I hope this works but like I would say a zero minus one confidence in his ability to get and stay sober he just had not succeeded prior to this he's been sober more than four years now he got out of there and never looked back and I wonder now uh whether something something must have changed in his brain by adopting what was essentially a different incentive structure right different incentive structure but fear wasn't doing it before fear of extreme consequences which were on the table at that time um when he went in weren't enough something about going there and the work that he did there allowed him to then it's almost like he he got another prefrontal cortex a more powerful prefrontal cortex so maybe we could talk about that well that's a that's not a bad way of thinking about what it is that people are trying to do when they say pray MH they so you can invite in spirits to possess you that's a good way of thinking about it I know that's odd terminology but that's what you do when you dwell on your rage right right now imagine that you're doing that in the most positive possible Direction so what you're doing is you're generating a hypothesis about the mode of conduct and perception that would best typify you if you were ideal and then establishing a relationship with that and inviting it in that's what the in Evangelical protest are doing when they formulate a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that's exactly what they're doing now on the addiction side so I studied alcoholism for years that was the T Target of my dissertation in the first 20 papers that I published I knew the alcoholism literature very well and the neurological end of it as well and it was known among alcohol researchers been known for 60 years more even that the most reliable treatment for alcoholism was religious transformation that's and this is well accepted among researchers in the field who have no religious affiliation whatsoever and I do believe that a huge part of that is a consequence of incentive restructuring so you said for example with your friend that fear wouldn't work well alcohol is a pretty good an anxiolytic drug but it's also for people who are prone to alcoholism it's a good incentive reward Source Like Cocaine if you're going to you can't get rats addicted to cocaine if they live in a natural environment they have to be isolated in a cage before they'll bar press to their own death for cocaine so one of the things you want to do when you treat addiction is you want to substitute a new incentive structure right because the Part Of The Addictive process is you fall into a false incentive pattern right because cocaine makes you feel like you're doing something useful in respect to an important goal even though you're not it's it mimics that even if you know you're not even if you know it's I've never done cocaine I would be open about it if I had I I I think I like dopaminergic States enough that I've been um very scared of doing it frankly also it wasn't around much just because of when I went to college it just wasn't a drug that was around much but it's a remarkable drug in the sense that people who take cocaine seem to be excited about everything they're in this High dopaminergic State and their brain becomes exceptionally good at finding cocaine even in the absence of resources which is pretty remarkable if you think about it you know I mean most people can't find the or get the thing they want in the absence of the resources to get it but people who take hard drugs that really Spike dopamine somehow manage yeah sure sometimes they Li and Ste extremely steal but they'll do other things too right they'll socialize with people that have it so they don't have to lie cheat and steal it's it's it's incredible to see that drug and things like methamphetamine take over people's minds and now I'm thinking the pathway appears when the aim is firmly in mind right see this is another this is another insistence that's derived from the religious literature so because the idea there is that if your aim is upward the pathway forward to that will make itself manifest and that's true you just pointed out that it was true in relationship to addiction right is that if once that once you're in that realm of possessed personality the pathway forward will show itself to you even under straightened circumstances right and it's partly because you can think of our per ctual systems and our emotional systems for that matter as navigating tools right so now the addiction the addicted brain what they see the aim is possessed by the substance of addiction right so now the highest God is cocaine let's say and so now all Pathways in the world are Pathways to cocaine all objects in the world are markers on the pathway to cocaine because it just dominates but it's not it's not just an Impulse it dominates the perceptual landscape as well that makes it and the emotional landscape and it comes with all these rationalizations that's all those lies right the whole thing it's a whole Personality yeah brutal brutal nowadays I get a lot of questions um about pornography and the the discussion around pornography is always related to the discussion around masturbation um but let's just talk about pornography for a moment in this context of these primitive drives and these circuits within the hypothalamus which we were all born with that um clearly some of them are devoted to our progression as a species through reproduction zero question about that sexual behavior being linked to reproduction not always but certainly we can all agree on that I a necessary precondition I hope we can still all agree on that but um last time I checked that's still true a sperm and an egg met someplace in some context to create all of us okay we're still grounded in that pornography is something that I hear quite a lot from typically young males but sometimes young females or even older females who say that they can see themselves trying to resist the desire to go look at it and it almost doesn't feel like a desire anymore they're sort of just in a um kind of a a compulsion that is that is almost unconscious but they're just aware of the fact that disorder like an disorder they're doing it they know they shouldn't be doing it and they can't help themselves and we could think about two ways to attack this if one believes it's a real concern and they certainly do so I do um I don't I would be open if I if I had or do I pornography is not been my thing and and I don't struggle with it but but when I hear from these people it's so clear that they're asking is it the prevalence of pornography out there or is it something really broken in them like are they broken but I don't know that I would say after having the discussion we've had thus far that they're broken it seems to me that it's like like the as you said it's the manifestation of one part of their it's one personality within them well and it's been it's been compulsively rewarded so you know when when a when you see yourself moving towards the culmination of a desired goal a dopamine that's accompanied by dopamine release okay and so two things you know this but everybody who's listening might not there's two elements to that dopamine release one is pleasure but the other is that the dopamine imagine that there are circuits activated as you're acting what the dopamine does is increase the probability that the circuits were that were activated just before the positive experience happened grow okay so now if you're engaged with pornography and that culminates in SE in in successful sexual satiation which it can that's what masturbation does then the whole personality that's oriented toward that set of stimuli is going to come to dominate it's very much like an addiction except it's it's you know there there has been there's been work done with generally simpler animals on these phenomena called super stimuli I think it's stickleback fish where this was first observed so males I hope I get this right but I've got it approximately right I believe it's male sticklebacks will they're are very agressive towards other male sticklebacks and the reason they're aggressive is because the other male sticklebacks have a red dot on their bellies so they don't like red dotts at all and so you can really enrage a stickleback with a red dot and if you use a red dot that's a little bigger and a little brighter than the typical Red Dot you get a super stimulus it's virtually irresistible to the stickle back and it's weird because the maximal activation is produced by a stimulus that they wouldn't see in nature it slightly exceeds that's exactly what pornography does it's a super stimulus right and it's not surprising that young males in particular are acceptable to that because male sexuality in human beings is very visually oriented very and a lot of our brain is visual way more than virtually every other animal certainly every other primate and ver and every other mammal and so we have a situation where any 13-year-old boy can see more hyper attractive super stimulus women in one day than the most successful man who ever lived a 100 years ago would have ever seen in his whole life yeah well that's a like an evolutionary ecological radical ecological transformation and the and it's worse because it's easily accessible so it takes no work right so not only is it a super stimulus it's one that's at hand so to speak and the uh and the uh the analog in the food world would bear highly palatable highly processed food yeah sugar fat combination you go into the other day I went into a gas station to use the restroom because I was traveling home for Thanksgiving and and I looked around I and I I thought this isn't a convenience store this is a pharmacy right everything that had chocolate also also seemed to have caffeine and color everything every drink seemed to combine not just sugar but also caffeine and some other things that would provide s stimulants then you've got nicotine and and these things on their own aren't necessarily bad any one of these one elements in low low enough doses in frequent use Etc but maybe sugar being the one that that clearly I think uh deserves um deeper investigation right um but it just occurred to me much different than difference between manufacturing sugar and Manufacturing cocaine I mean you take something that's available in its natural form in relatively low concentrations and purify it I mean cocoa leaves the natives used cocoa leaves forever as mild stimulant didn't seem to cause them any trouble but that's way different than cocaine right and sugar has the same arguably the same pathological properties well I didn't think we were going to go here but I think it's extremely appropriate and important that we do so I I know that you followed what is essentially an Elimination Diet for a number of years you eat meat right um I eat meat vegetables fruit and um some starches unrefined starches in any event one thing that I is absolutely clear from following a clean diet so to speak of any kind but let's say of the sort that you follow or I follow is that you very soon learn the relationship between Taste of the food volume of the food macronutrient so protein fat or carbohydrate content micronutrients and satiation which is if you think about it it's sort of like a big plate of broccoli or a big steak or something the brain learns and the hypothalamus learns the association between the taste the caloric content what else is in there and satiation if you think about highly processed food or even combinations of multiple ingredients that's absolutely impossible to do the brain can't parse what are the various things in here and how do they relate to my feelings of satisfaction it's the difference between a super drug and what I believe are the the elements that were explain explain why you think that's that link learned link about satiation can't be learned in the case of these processed foods yeah because in the context of these processed foods they're activating multiple neuron systems in the hypothalamus and gut we know that the gut has neurons that can respond to Sugar fatty acids and amino acid content and there's a you know this prominent theory that you know one of the main reasons we eat is to forage for amino amino acids that we'll eat until we get enough of the essential amino acids and and we correlate that with taste but that the gut has neurons we we know the gut has neurons that signal through the Vegas up through a little relay called the noo gangling if you want to look at it fun um fun name and then up to the dopaminergic centers of the brain which make us oh when we eat something that has a high uh essential amino acid content like a steak like a really tasty steak the neurons in the gut in a way that is independent of taste are signal in to the brain ah I'm getting essential amino acids you should eat more of this thing if those let's just say a small fraction of those amino acids that are present in a candy bar in a you know a package of of Skittles which I'm I'm guessing there's very few of them if any you're going to continue to forage for food because those neurons will also respond to Sugar basically it will keep you eating until you get enough of those amino acids in other words there are two parallel tracks one within our system Pathways to satiation that totally right multiple Pathways to satiation one depending on taste one dependent on actual nutrient content the mouth can only learn taste Association the mouth can't actually learn nutrient content the gut knows nutrient content the problem is you take a food that is low in a micronutrient or macronutrient or essential amino acids or essential fatty acids after all there are no essential carbohydrates there are only essential amino acids and essential fatty acids right right right and it will keep you eating and it will keep the appetite system revving until you get enough of those now here's the issue if you've ever done this that's empty calories empty calories but so so in some ways um you know this again is an analog to the whole discussion around pornography masturbation and and reproduction right I'm not saying that reproduction is the be all end all of sexual activity but in the evolutionary sense it absolutely is right there's no question about that there's no moral judgment there that's just the reality so the the the the situation with food is is the following if we are eating without any gut Level under understanding of what what's coming in we will keep eating if you let me give an example you probably haven't done this experiment in a while but if you've ever just had you know ribeye steak or two it's pretty satiating maybe you also have a salad if you're me or some broccoli or something like that if one takes then even after you've eaten all that one bite of pasta one bite of pasta the the next impulse is more yes right even though you already have enough essential amino acids from those steaks you're loosing you know uh threshold you've reached that Etc all the the good stuff why because blood glucose goes up and then you desire more because blood glucose elevations are linked directly to the dopaminergic system so what I'm basically trying to say here is that I do think that there are elements to our food modern food if you will it seems like it's you know anything but modern in the sense that it's worse for us than the more primitive foods but highly processed foods pornography any drug that spikes dopamine dramatically like methamphetamine for instance any behavior that spikes dopamine dramatically that very quickly hijacks these circuits and to me the way to to teach those circuits a a calmer more um prudent version of themselves right to enter a different hypothalamic uh activation pattern is to start breaking the things down into their Essential Elements right about the motivation the pleasure Etc to Tamp all that down I mean we know that for pornography if the pornography is very extreme then less extreme pornography doesn't seem to work well that's because there's also a novelty kick in dopaminergic striving right I mean so with any basic repetitive pleasure there's a dopaminergic kick but with any novelty there's also a dopaminergic kick so there's an optimized threshold for novelty and repetitive striving that plays out in pornography so um there's the direct effect of the stimulus as such but the there's variation in the stimulus that's also novel and so you it's a common pattern for pornographic usage to become more what would you say fetishistic that's one way of thinking about it as it progresses because that that keeps the novelty alive that's very dangerous that's a very dangerous development right and I would venture in a very different domain that if you were to eat your steaks slathered in barbecue sauce for a couple of weeks going back to the way that you eat them now which by the way this is a great opportunity to educate people about something that you taught me when we had dinner last which is that if you're going to order a steak order a Pittsburgh Char the Char on the outside is incredibly tasty they're we love that the Umami taste is that we you have a devoted taste receptor that it's complex yeah so and if they don't know what a Pittsburgh Char is then maybe you're in the wrong restaurant or you need to educate them but incredibly satiating delicious right but if you were to slather those steaks in in a bunch of things I would suspect that after a while your plain steaks wouldn't taste as good but certain but the way to make them taste good again would be to eat them plain for a period of time in which the stuff the all the condiments Etc would start to become aversive I do believe that when we return to the the sort of most um naturally satisfying mode of engaging with these uh with these circuits here we're talking about food and sex in parallel that they become especially satiating and I think that you know in hearing from all these people that are addicted to pornography and they're not addicted like they telling me they love it and they can't stop they're telling me it's no longer working for them that the that there's this you know diminishment in the amount of dopamine that they're getting over time and they feel trapped within it and they have no sense whatsoever because they haven't been socialized you to go out and find a real relationship a real sexual relationship or a relationship of any well it also it's also there is some evidence suggesting too that if you've been socialized into pornography sexuality it's actually quite difficult to establish a sexual relationship with an actual partner now I would say to some degree that's always been difficult because it's a complex form of Behavior but the introduction of pornography well it sets up a whole landscape of expectation for example that's not necessarily going to play out that well in the real world let's say and and there's also a learning of those biological systems in the brain to um evoke arousal by observing sex as opposed to participating complet completely different so some of these um right that's voer right you're basically learning to be a Voyer right right and so you think about young brains that are highly plastic yeah learning that so the returning yeah we have no idea what to make of that because especially for young men because when they hit puberty sexuality becomes a very uh insistent force and we have no idea what effect pornography has on the development of male sexuality none I've wondered for a while whether there's something inherently rewarding about creating impact or action at a distance here's why I've been watching these videos of elon's rockets and thinking like that is awesome that is awesome we're built on a throwing platform you know yeah just there's one image of the of the the rocket thrusters that just captivated me I'm I'm not a spacecraft guy I mean I think it's really cool but I wouldn't consider myself somebody that like looks at the stars and thinks I want to go you I want to go up there I might if I give the opportunity that's not been my thing but I looked at this and I thought what an awesome Display of Power but then I was saying like what is power it's really about having impact or action at a distance when we were kids we like dirt claw Wars targeted right what what an incredible display of funneling the laws of physics and Engineering into something that can have enormous action at a distance and perhaps even take us into new galaxies amazing right the word sin in many languages means to miss the Target right and and it it speaks to exactly what you're describing like that that the cache of action at a distance that's unbelievably deeply embedded in us that's why I made that throwing gesture like human beings throw that's our physiology right we can throw something at a distant Target well that's structured our our cognition we're using our thoughts to hit distant targets that's what we do all the games that young men play so many of those games are Target games all of the sports spectacles that people want to participate in vicariously even vicariously they're Target hitting games like our gaze specifies as the center of a Target there's targets everywhere and we're unbelievably focused on Bridging the Gap between where we are and where we're going yeah that's the whole perceptual landscape I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors on your results results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduced those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification a and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function so this thing about action at a distance to me feels like so inherent to our progression as a species most Technologies are about that in fact if you think about social media you know somebody tweets something and you know when people react to it maybe positively or negatively the school shooter in a very dark example a sad a tragic example right action at a distance then you think about pornography and masturbation and I'm not passing any moral judgment here it's a the ultimate form of creating action at a distance would be to create a new human being with somebody right I mean that's it's you're propagating it in physical distance creating a new being and in time right I mean incredible and then you think about masturbation and you think about pornography and there is no action at a distance and I'm not just punning here I mean literally there's not much action at a distance it's all up close to oneself but there's there's no impact on anybody it's almost as if the energy that we're born with to be able to create positive things to evolve our species through action at a distance through creation of knowledge technology children communities culture the ultimate expression it's just loop back into oneself it's it's as if and and I I don't know what language there is for this in biology but it's as if like all that dop energic Drive is just kind of looped back into oneself and it goes nowhere and I think when I hear about the incredibly like what the language for it is only like the diminished Souls of these people who are coming to me saying like you know like help and I'm thinking okay listen I'm a podcaster I'm a scientist I know some things about the dopaminergic system but you know there are ways that they can get help I think they're 12-step programs for this and so forth and other things but you know I think what they're saying is that they're they're just kind of dissolving in their own um in their own reflex but there's no action at a distance for them this is the same thing I see with the Failure to Launch kids who are still living at home who are not having any action at a distance I think we were designed to disperse from our families and to create action at a distance up until a certain age but I see so many of the problems that we face as failure to find a productive way to have action failure Venture I would say in in the ter techology that I've been developing so for example in this in this book and we who wrestle with God I'm one of the stories I analyze is the story of Abraham and it's very interesting story psychologically I mean I think it's it's it's stunning actually and I'll lay some of that out for you you can tell me what you think about it so so the Divine is characterized in the classic stories of our culture as um the ultimate up so you could think about the Divine as the target as such rather than any particular Target so here's a way of thinking about it you know so an ambition will seize you and then you'll aim at fulfilling that ambition but once the ambition is fulfilled a new ambition makes itself manifest which might be a greater ambition let's say if if your personality is expansive and then if you fulfill that the same thing will happen so then you could imagine that there's a meta ambition behind all proximal Ambitions okay now the Divine characterization of the Divine is a characterization of that meta ambition that's a good way of thinking about it so it's something that recedes as you approach it but it's also the thing that all Ambitions have in common and we know there is such a thing because otherwise we wouldn't have a concept of ambition right which speaks to a commonality among Ambitions okay in the story of Abraham the Divine is characterized in relationship to something like ambition so Abraham has the he's already immersed in a situation that's Akin in a way to the scenario of a wealthy and a a person in the modern world who's in a situation of abundance Abraham's parents are wealthy and they provide for him there's nothing he needs to do and in consequence so he's attained the Socialist Utopia or the cons humorist Utopia you can look at it either way and there's no reason for him to move forward so he doesn't he doesn't do anything till he's 75 and then the voice comes to him which is the voice of Adventure and it's God in this story that's how God is defined right and God says to Abraham you have to leave all this Comfort which is a very interesting proposition to begin with it's like why the hell hell would you leave that when you have everything you need well the implication is is that you don't have everything you need when you're being delivered everything you need that isn't how life works okay so God says you have to leave your your father's tent you have to leave your tribe you have to leave those who speak your language you have to venture out into the world so God is conceptualized in this story as the impulse the voice that compels you out into the world and that encourages you to do so so that's a hypothesis about what the ultimate up is okay and Abraham agrees and he does so in two ways he he builds an altar signifying his aim that he's going to abide by the command of this voice or the invitation of this voice and that he'll make the appropriate sacrifices there a crucial there's a crucial it's a crucial point to understand because the process of transformation requires sacrifice to be more than you are means you have to let go of that which you were you have to make sacrifices now Abraham's life is punctuated by a sequence of reaffirmations of his upward aim and declamations of his willingness to sacrifice every time he finishes an adventure he re constitutes the Covenant right so this is this agreement to follow the voice of Adventure okay God makes him a deal that's the Covenant it's very interesting deal so now imagine biologically speaking that there is an instinct to integrate that operates within us okay so now it's not it's just as fundamental as the hypothalamic motivational States let's say but it's more sophisticated and what it's trying to do is to integrate all the motivational States across time and socially right and then IM imagine it manifests itself as an instinct to be something like the instinct to mature right to move forward right to leave your zone of comfort right and maybe there have been people like chicks Mahi who've characterized that as the attractiveness of flow and maybe it's associated with the exploratory circuit in the hypothalamus that's mediated by dopamine okay but it's it's got its character now the character of that instinct in this story is the way it's characterized is as the voice of Adventure so it's the thing that asks you to move beyond your zone of comfort and go into the foreign world now the advantage to that is that you fortify yourself and you develop right so no matter how good you are now if you push yourself to the edge you're going to be better than you are and that's a better win than merely being good like you are now so that would be particip a in that transformative process is a higher form of attainment than mere attainment of any specific goal okay so that's the Call to Adventure that's the call to a quest that's what Gandalf offers Bilbo for example okay God characterizes the consequences of that and this is so cool it when I figured this out it just flattened me it's so interesting God says okay if you God is defined as that which says this by the way if you push yourself beyond your zone of comfort even if it's functioning for you that's Abraham's situation here's what'll happen you'll become you'll live your life in a manner that's a blessing to you so that's a good deal a because Lots the the miserable people you're talking about the depressed people the the trapped people their life isn't a blessing to themselves so what's a pathway to blessing well it's not satiation not in this formulation it's voluntary it's the voluntary Quest and it's characterized by Adventure so that's deal number one you'll live in a life that'll be a blessing to you okay and then God says that's not all that'll happen you'll be a blessing to yourself in a manner that will make you renowned among other people justly that's a good deal because we know that people men in particular are very status oriented partly because their reproductive success is highly correlated with their social status and you know the Psychopaths game that but still it's like Renown is crucially important you want to be the quarterback on the shoulders of your teammates you know so that'll be the second thing that happens and then the same voice says and that's not all you'll be a blessing to yourself and be renowned in a manner that will maximize the probability that you will establish something of lasting value that's a good deal so that's that's stretching across time multi-generationally because God tells Abraham that if he follows the path of Adventure he'll be the father of Nations so what that means is that he'll establish the pattern of paternal conduct that will maximally that will maximize the success of his offspring in the longest possible run that's so cool this is Success at a distance and over time exactly and then the the final offer is you'll do that in a way that'll bring abundance to everyone else too now so think about what that means biologically this is so cool and I I can't see how it can be wrong it means that if you hearken to the voice that calls you out of your zone of comfort you do that voluntarily so you put yourself on the edge of Adventure you will be following the Instinct that has already evolved to make your life a blessing to yourself to make you successful among other people to maximize your probability of long-term success and to do that in a way that brings abundance to your community and then you think look let's take the contrary hypothesis the contrary hypothesis would be twofold there is no compulsion to Adventure it's like that seems highly improbable or that the compulsion to Adventure isn't aligned with psychological and social well-being well what's the what's the chance that the fundamental drive that would facilitate your transformation across time would not be aligned with your psychological integrity and the success of the community like we wouldn't be social animals if that was the case so as far as I can tell that has to be true now that doesn't mean you can get lost in false Adventures that can happen that's what an addiction is or like or or that's what pornography is it's a false Adventure right it's failure to hit the proper Target you might say but that Central Drive to integration across time and communally why wouldn't that be an instinct and then we could cap that with an observation that I also think is self-evidently true once you understand it so imagine that you're a father now this Spirit of Adventure is often characterized paternally right in so far as God's the father in these ancient stories so think about this so when you see your son now it's also true of your daughter but I'll focus on Sons for the moment when you see your son and you love your son when you see your son pushing himself Beyond his own limits in an adventurous manner if you're a good father you def definitely encourage that right and I would say in so far as you encourage that you are a good father and that would mean that you're the embodiment of that spirit that calls to Adventure that's why Abraham is characterized for example in this story as forging an alliance with the spirit of his ancestors with the deity of his ancestors he's embodying the Call to Adventure and that's what makes him the father whose reproductive Enterprise is successful across the broadest possible span of time I think that's I just can't see how that can be wrong and that's a characterization of the Divine there there's other it it complexifies a because what what the stories are trying to do is to give you an image of what that integrating personality might be like and it's sophisticated so a single characterization is insufficient so in the story of Noah God is this personality is characterized quite differently so Noah is presented as a man who's wise in his Generations which means that for his time and place he's moral and reputable so he's the sort of guy that people would go to for advice because he's lived a life that's emblematic of his wisdom let's say okay now a voice comes to him and says batting down the hatches there mate trouble's coming okay so so here's the hypothesis the hypothesis is the voice that calls to the wise to prepare in times of trouble is a manifestation of the Divine and it's the same as the voice that calls the unwilling to Adventure that's the monotheistic hypothesis and so you can see what the imagination is doing is agglomerating these different characterizations of high aim insisting that there's an integrated Unity behind them and then trying to conceptualize that integrated Unity across time and so and I think that's done I think that's done with radical success in the biblical library that the culmination of the library of stories is the impressionistic representation of this integrating pattern and I think that's what people call on when they're engaging in a religious Enterprise that is radically successful like that happened in the case of your friend right so he got a new personality and that new personality had different incentive structure and so that just superseded the addiction it's almost as if I mean I realize that for people listening it might not seem like this but to us his friends who had seen him try so hard in the context of people he truly deeply cares about more than anybody in the world his children his wife it was almost like he got a brain transplant it was it was astonishing how does he account for it like if you asked him like okay you had every reason to change and yet you didn't and then all of a sudden you did like how does he understand that he uses very um uh Christian religious language he said that he felt Jesus's love for him and he saw an image of who he could become this was important perhaps no doubt not just perhaps but no doubt of who he could become that was worth it and he had the adequate social support within this place and so there was reinforcement yeah but what's what's remarkable is that he was able to take that outside of this place it it was a residential facility out of this place and carry it with him and to this day he is Rock Solid okay so in that domain and I will say in in all the other domains of his life too extremely successful as an artist I don't want to out him you know extremely successful as a as a commercial artist and happy and in service and um just seems like he got a brain trans right so there's a mystery there that's kind of threefold one is um what the hell did he mean that he realized that Jesus Christ loved him right that's okay what do you mean by that and then somehow that's associated with the vision he developed of who he could be if he was everything he could be there's a relationship between those two things and then there's this third mystery is the culmination of those two phenomena freedom of his addiction even out of the context of the center that's right very difficult to understand that but you know we know think about it this way if you're possessed by rage different phenomena have dopaminergic cache to you than if you're possessed by like uh sexual desire like obviously right absolutely right so so the idea that a given stimuli produces a given motivational response is incorrect because that's framework dependent right and then most so I think one of the best ways to understand a motivational Drive is that a motivational Drive grips the target it establishes the Target right and it's not it may it may increase the probability that certain action patterns will make themselves manifest that would be the kind of the compulsive element but fundamentally what it's doing is changing the Target that rearranges the perceptual landscape and it transforms the emotions because now if your target is there things that lead you there are dopaminergically relevant if your target is there things that lead you there are relevant same underlying emotion but the the stimuli so to speak that give rise to the emotion are radically different so now he has a different orientation and aim and so the incentive structure of his psyche is radically transformed now we know that can happen because that happens to you when you move from one motivated state to another I think in 12-step programs they they allow the steps to be Milestones I mean there's clearly a dopaminergic component I hope people understand that dopamine is dumb in fact dopamine isn't Dumb dopamine has no intelligence at all it's just a currency of motivation and reward and what which is why it can be gained by cocaine which is why it can be gained by cocaine or or most anything that can you know uh you know feret its way into the hypothalamic system and I I hope people picked up on what you said before because um it's so important that as one moves toward a Target dopamine increases and root to that Target I'm I'm rephrasing what you said before you said it wonderfully I just want to make sure people understand that as that dopamine increases the probability that your perception will go to something other than the target decreases exponentially as you get closer and closer you get more and more dopamine the greater the elevation dopamine the lower the probability that you'll engage in any other p of self it's like it's almost or the or personality type other than the one that you're engaged in in pursuit of this Behavior will emerge not least because as you approach successfully the probability of ultimate success is obviously increasing so it makes perfect sense that you would narrow and focus right you run faster as you as you see the Finish Line right faster and faster I this concept of sin as missing the Target or this definition of sin I think is incredibly important hamartia is the Greek word and L it's literally an archery term but it's also the word for sin in ancient Hebrew is also an archery term and so and there's other languages where that's the case but it it's really important to understand that that is that notion is predicated on this target seeking phys psychophysiology and that that's unbelievably deeply built into us as you pointed out you know our eyes are Target established well it's so important to us that we infer aim from gays right and it's more than that not only do we infer aim from gaze we mimic the psychophysiological state of the Target that we're watching as a consequence of her inference of aim from gaze so if I can see what you're looking at then I can occupy the same psychophysiological state that you do and that's the basis of my understanding this is so important and I'm uh there's something that I've never talked about on this or any other podcast which is that in humans we have a massive expansion of an area of the frontal cortex called The frontal eye Fields so there's circuitry deep in the brain if you want to look it up it's Superior culus it's also called the tectum in other species it means roof it's the roof of the midbrain Etc that generate reflexive eye movements you stimulate in there it's like a machine in fact a colleague of mine who's now retired at Stanford Eric nudson who did some beautiful work on neuroplasticity um was describing experiment where they take out the frontal cortex of these owls owls are because they um you know they don't have much movements they move their head almost you know almost all the way around right we've all seen that get and they use this for for for homing in on their targets the owl or a monkey or a human in the absence of a prefrontal cortex or suppression of prefrontal Cortex becomes like a machine you click here they look there you click here they look there puppies are like this kittens are like this everything's a stimulus why because there isn't that top- down inhibition of those reflexes in humans we have an area that's why a a cat with no braid is hyp exploratory right everything's a Target everything's a targ everything is a Target and there's no context dependent learning right I love that you gave the example of the desate cats um they even can do fictive motion they can walk on a treadmill and it's like with no cortex it's amazing makes you rethink the cortex that's for sure and humans have these frontal eye fields which are an evolved area they're present in other species too but they're massively expanded in humans so this is a a cortical area a frontal cortical area devot oted to controlling Gaye and the context and control of Gaye so it no longer becomes just a reflex that you can suppress as in the case with an adult cat versus a kitten or a dog versus a puppy the frontal eye Fields actually regulate all sorts of context dependent like oh like he's looking at me directly is it aggressive yeah um well then maybe I'll activate my aggression or maybe I'll brace my defenses or wow she's uh we came to this party together but she seem super interested in like directing her gaze how are we inferring this sometimes it's body language sometimes it's this sometimes he looked at her there are all these memes about this right you know right the famous the famous look over the shoulder meme that seems to have taken over the internet from time to time with the appropriate facial response exactly so humans have an if massively expanded notion of what gaze is and our ability to control gaze and understanding of gaze I just so when when you raise this this idea that when you raise this fact rather about gays defining the target it'll end that looking at others' gaze allows us to understand what they are defining as the target we starting to get get into Notions of theory of mind and things of that sort well so so what that implies in keeping with our previous conversation is that as you mature and your cortex integrates and you become cortically dominant the targets of your gaze become voluntary right this is a big deal because it means that you can concentrate on the distal let's say the temporary temporally distal at the expense of the proximal so you know if if you're walking down the street and you hear a loud and sudden noise behind you you'll do an anti-predator Crouch and then turn and you'll do that essentially automatically so so so curl up turt and and you turn you turn to the place where your stereoscopic audition has indicated that the noise emanated from right and so and that's automatic that's the control of the eye gate gaze and and well and and bodily posture by those underly yeah this is a super has a map of of auditory world so when you hear something to right you turn to your right right right and you do that before you think right okay so that's a that's an activation of the eye felds let's say by these underlying motivational systems that have this personality like autonomy but you can you can you can Orient your part of the religious Enterprise is to orient your eyes heavenward what does that mean well you can think about it it means to search out the north star that navigates for you uniring regardless of the situation at hand imagine you could progress towards a Target in a manner that made all the potential targets that you could progress toward more likely it's a meta Target you said that's what happened to your friend right is not only did he dispense with his addiction but all of the things enter other Enterprises that he was associating that that that he was pursuing in his life became more effective it's almost like and I it is as if every goal was like elevated right and it's funny because for the first couple of months that I was interacting with him I thought okay okay like like he's different and and I thought you know like most people would you know perhaps would think like all right let's see let's see but this has been four years now he's very he's very consistent with his um with his program he you know he's involved in a program that keeps him on track right um but he's he's elevated and he's not talking above people it's like he's elevated but he's grounded when you talk to him he's not kind of off some other place he's actually very very present yeah and even his text messages are very much of like what's going on today you know asking questions that are very much of the now yeah and it's been a a remarkable thing to observe well because he was about as down in his addiction and had so much to lose and had um essentially risked it over and over over and over to the point where you know I I didn't think it was ever going to turn around and most and all of his friends thought the same and his wife of course is delighted and his kids are delighted of course and um I could say this without revealing because no one knows I'm Godfather to his son and his son is thriving which is wonderful to see and I just think of sometimes about how badly it could have gone the other way yeah and it's fantastic it's like it's nothing short of spectacular okay so so let me let me put that into a context of let's say an archetypal story okay so I did a course for Peterson Academy on The Sermon on the Mount And The Sermon on the Mount is a it's a Str it's a metag goal strategy it's very practical it's very very practical and it emerges out of the biblical tradition in a very grounded manner it's a logical extension of the biblical ethical precursors so what Christ says to his followers in the course of The Sermon on the Mount is first Orient your eyes upward okay so that's in alignment with the notion that the first born is to be consecrated to God there's a meaning to that and and the meaning is something like this imagine that your life consists of a sequence of episodes okay an episode has a beginning and a middle and an end the beginning sets the frame for the episode so at the beginning of an Enterprise you want to you want to lift your eyes heavenward so you establish the highest possible goal so that that constitutes the frame of perception for that episode that's the idea that's why the firstborn should be consecrated to God so for example in to think about it prosaically before we sat down for our podcast because we've done many podcasts we we strive to inhabit the framework that will make the podcast most radically successful now you could imagine that that could be subordinated to either of our proximal desire for an increase in short-term personal Fame right or we could try to dominate each other in the conversation or we could Orient ourselves properly and we could do what we could to pursue the track towards Revelation so to speak and we could Elevate our conversation in that manner okay and that would set the frame for the conversation and the good podcasters always do that right they're not playing games or if they're playing games it's of the highest possible order it's a quest yeah okay quest for what enlightenment for truth right for Mutual understanding and then maybe for the education of those who are participating all right so Christ says first Orient your eyes upward right that's to love God above all so whatever that upward Divinity is you establish an allegiance with that and you allow that to determine your perceptions and your motivations next operate under the assumption that other people like you participate in that nature of that utmost aim and treat them that way next concentrate on the moment right right and that's exactly right because it's exactly right because when you specify your aim the pathway makes itself manifest otherwise you could never use your senses to orient you'd never get anywhere right so if you aim upward to the best of your ability then the pathway upward is what will make itself manifest in front of you then you have to attend to it and so then you get this weird perverse optimality which is you're focused on the longest temporal scale and the highest possible elevation and you can make most use of what's right in front of you and that the implication in The Sermon on the Mount is that there's no difference between that and participating in life eternal as it unfolds in the moment and I think that's that's seems to me to be exactly right it's exactly right and so you know I I was I was thinking of that because you said your friends all of your friends Endeavors had become elevated so imagine that one problem you might want to solve is what your goals should be but a much deeper problem would be how do you conceptualize your goals in relationship to one another across the broadest span of time and person so that every goal has the highest probability of succeeding that would be like the pursuit of a metagal I would say that's what defines the religious Enterprise there's another variant of that for example so a variant of that would be not how do you solve the problem of Any Given thing that terrifies you but how do you solve the problem of the class of things that terrify you and the dragon fight mythology is the solution to that problem so the attitude there is you adopt The Stance of voluntary what a voluntary approach in the face of Terror because that's the best meta strategy right and that's the strategy that works to protect you across the largest possible array of dangerous situations this is what we learned in as clinical psychologists with exposure therapy right you find the particulars of what someone is afraid of that turns out to be somewhat irrelevant you teach people to voluntarily confront what they're avoiding and that doesn't make them them less afraid it makes them more competent and braver and that generalizes right and so yeah the religious Pursuit is the pursuit of of metag goals in relationship to positive and negative emotion that's a good way of thinking about it I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium in the correct ratios but no sugar we should all know that proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function in fact even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance to a considerable degree it's also important that you're not just hydrated but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes in the right ratios drinking a packet of element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration and electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink a packet of element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes there are a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element I like the watermelon I like the raspberry I like the Citrus basically I like all of them if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman laab to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman laab to claim a free sample P pack I love this idea of looking upward and defining or at least having a sense that there's a um internalization of the greatest possible outcome and when I say greatest both for ones but also for the community right yeah that's life more abundant or that's that's the symbolic terminology or life in eternity both of those are the same thing so imagine you're fighting with your wife okay now you're dominated by rage now the advantage to that is you're ready and but the disadvantage is you're going to strive for proximal Victory okay now you don't want to be a pushover that's a mistake so then what could you do instead you could pause and you could remember okay if this could rectify itself in the best possible manner what would that look like well it's it's complicated right you don't want your wife to be defeated and you don't want to be defeated and you want to solve the problem but you don't want to sweep it under the rug you want to solve it in a way that solved that works across time that benefits your relationship in an upward Manner and you have to make sure that you're not hijacked by that hypothalamic circuit or personality as you've you will be you if if you don't alter your aim you will be because you need to substitute you got to think I'd really like to win this like I'd seriously like to win this battle it's like no you need something better than that Victory and that would be the a victory that would deepen and enrich your relationship and help it grow across time and then you can remember that it's like I'm going to listen even though I think my wife is wrong I'm going to listen and I'm going to see if I can find a pathway in the argument that makes our relationship better and then you think now you have to really want that because if you really want that if you if you got that Vision fleshed out properly you'll want that more than you'll want to win and and then you might say well why it's like because it's a better deal so there's one of Christ's Parables where he talks about a pearl of great price which is the Pearl that a rich man would sell everything he owns to possess and it's it's something like a reference to that it's like why would you ever attain a proximal Victory if you could attain an ultimate Victory that's the battle let's say between the salvation of the soul and the victory in sin that's how the religious language would portray it well you can win a local Victory and it looks like it it looks like you win but if you forgo the ultimate game that's not a victory that's a defeat obviously it might even be a worse defeat than if you lost absolutely I I've been um spouting off on social media and podcast for a while now that any big inflection in dopamine that isn't preceded by a lot of effort to generate that dopamine inflection is very dangerous think drugs think pornography think highly processed food Foods think anything that you know creates this B big sense of indulgence and pleasure without any effort is running countercurrent to our evolutionary wiring now you could say well okay so what are we supposed to do move in C no reward no reward without commencer sacrifice that's right that's of some sort Y and the other issue and it's coming up again and again today and I love that it is is this notion of the temporal domain of rewards that exist over multiple time scales or broader time scales one of the things that I feel truly lucky for um is the fact that I went the path of science where we were uh chuckling about this earlier um you know a project could take a year then you have to restart because that project went nowhere and then you finish the project you submit a paper the review I mean the reward schedule in science could take four years it's not just about getting a degree like getting papers through sometimes took a year sometimes took two years you know um sometimes things didn't go well and you had to publish in a journal that you wouldn't have wanted to or sometimes you had to abandon projects altogether so my reward system was trained up on lots of time scales short medium longtime scales as I've moved into podcasting the the uh the temporal Loops are shorter they're faster um but you know nonetheless you know we we do long long form content and um but you know I think platforms like X I think are wonderful if used appropriately I think it's especially great nowadays frankly um and Instagram Etc they're very useful but they train us and I imagine they've trained the the young brains that were weaned on them cuz I wasn't but that were weaned on them for fast temporal yeah uh time scales this isn't like playing this isn't like playing a long poker game this is like playing the slot machine over and over and over right um it's not like a 4day tournament complete with intermittent random reinforcement which is what happens when something goes viral unpredictably right right it's really yeah and and then of course we have this notion in this country that you know in any moment it could be a Rags to Riches or over you know some you know overnight Fame type thing that exists as a possibility in our culture that in a way that it hadn't prior so I think that one of the things that could be useful just venturing a hypothesis here is that young and older people could um take a look at their life and ask you know over what variation of time scales do I derive reward yeah defin you know training for a marathon is a is a longer time scale that's also a Hallmark of maturity yeah School degree Etc um in business the time skills are sometimes fast sometimes um short I think you can ask even a better question than that the the better question would be and this is kind of what's referred to in The Sermon on the Mount is how could I optimize my long-term view well maximizing my focus on the moment because then you get both that's a really that's a really good deal right because now you're conducting yourself in a manner that works in an itrated way that's socially productive right and and maybe intergenerationally socially productive that would be the best thing to establish that's kind of what you're doing as a good father but you're doing that in a manner that enables you to also derive maximal impact from each step you take forward in the present so Carl friston told me we were talking about entropy and and emotion I'd figured out a few years ago with a couple of my students that anxiety signifies the emergence of entropy like technically which I was really thrilled about because it it gives emotion a physical grounding like a real physical grounding and friston surprised me because he said he has a theory of positive emotion that's analogous he also knew the negative emotion he he'd also been working in that domain he said that you get a dopamine kick when you reduce the entropy in relationship to a goal and I thought oh my God that's so cool because it means that uncertainty is entropy when it emerges you get anxious but when you see yourself stepping toward w a goal you get a dopamine kick and the reason that's an entropy related to entropy is because with each step successful step you take towards a goal you reduce the uncertainty of the pursuit which is manifested in that phenomena you described which is when you see the Finish Line you start running faster right so they're both related to entropy well to have goals at multiple time scales you need to be able to re in I I love this entropy argument it makes total sense that you want to be able to uh withstand the the the the periods of time when you don't know whether or not things are becoming more or less uncertain this is part of becoming um an adult if you will okay okay so yeah that was exactly the thread so there's there's two cories of that one is that the more valuable the goal towards which you're progressing the higher the dopamine kick per unit of advancement so what that means is you want an ultimate goal operating in the domain of each proximal subg goal and that's what happens with this upward orientation it's like what you're trying to do is to make things as good as they could be whatever that means over the longest possible span of time for the largest number of people you included now you're not going to know exactly how to do that but that can be your goal okay now that's going to inform your perceptions and your perceptions of pathway but it's also going to modify your reward system because now every proximal step forward is indicator of entropy reduction in regard to that metag goal well there isn't any by definition there isn't anything you can do that's more exciting than that see that kind of explains why your friend was able to pop out of his addictive frame because now he's doing something that's so worthwhile that the temptation of alcohol let's say pales in comparison right right right and right it's a rewriting of the reward contingencies yeah yeah right exactly and and now you can imagine that you could imagine a situation where a culture explores across time to find out how to characterize that goal such that if that goal is pursued people integrate psychologically in a manner that integrates them socially across large spans of time I think that's what happens when the monotheistic Revelation emerges that's ex that's what's happening from a from a biological perspective is that we're starting to characterize the longest term goal yeah something like that this is why I believe that pornography is potentially so poisonous because the level of uncertainty is basically zero yeah people can access what they want to see they can keep foraging until they find it yeah and that's not the way that relationships work the way relationships work is I ask somebody out they might say yes they might say no you got on a date they might not want a second date well things could progress you might think that you're on the path to one thing it turns out it doesn't work or it's it's you're not compatible you know I me that's also extremely salutary because if you're being rejected like say you're a foraging male and you're being rejected all the time and you forgo that for pornography what you're foregoing is the corrective that all those women are offering you like they're rejecting you because there is something wrong like seriously there's something wrong and now you escape from that you think well that's a relief because no more rejection it's like yeah no more rejection no more learning no more Improvement and no possibility of of an actual life right no action at a distance yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no distal no distal accomplishment right yeah the only implication of the pornography masturbation scenario is that is more pornography masturbation that's the only implication of it that's that's all that possibly could AR worse than that because it's more pornography in a degenerating game because as you said you have to chase that novelty Edge otherwise dopamine is driven down further well and that means what it's going to get more and more extreme well that that's not a good scenario that's not a good like what do you mean more and more extreme exactly like where does that end well you know a casual glance at online pornography can give you some real insight into where that ends like there's that's a bottomless pit and and in the most pernicious possible manner because sexual it can definitely twist itself into pathological forms that undermine psychological integrity and demolish Society no we see this with people who are highly successful who seem to have lots of areas of their life regulated and then you know they collapse their lives I we sometimes see it with with drugs of abuse as well although unless those drugs of abuse are dopaminergic and people have them in a in check so to speak which is exceedingly rare yes it's usually just a matter of time and they they don't reach the mountain top yes while time is the problem as we've been pointing out let me tell you another story this is from Revelation so Revelation is a vision of the end of time okay now time ends all the time like our adventures end our lives end our relationships end so the end has a pattern okay Revelation is a vision of the Eternal pattern of the end so here's an element of the Vision it's so remarkable I figured this out with my friend Jonathan pasio so there's a vision in a subvision in in the sequential dream of revelation of the Scarlet Beast and the of Babylon and it's very relevant to our discussion on pornography you'll understand it right away so it's a vision of how Society disintegrates okay now imagine when Society disintegrates men disintegrate according to their pattern and women disintegrate according to their pattern that makes perfect sense right because if Society disintegrates it's going to be men and women who disintegrate there's no reason to assume that their pattern of disintegration would be identical okay Scarlet Beast is is that's the Scarlet beast of the state that's Babylon let's say that's the degenerate tyrannical state has multiple heads why because whatever United it has vanished that's like the death of God it's vanished and so now it's got heads in every direction so it's confused and it's red scared because that's that confusion that disintegration is the precursor to the river of blood right the Red Sea this the swamp of chaos so when the patriarchal state disintegrates it loses its unity and then it's multiple heads right and that's that's an that's the emblem of descent into diverse chaos and gazes everywhere with these multiple heads precisely precisely it's not integrated okay now that's the disintegration of the patriarchy you might say a top that is the of Babylon that's a beautiful woman who's subordinated her psyche to the demands of sexuality she's the mother of all prostitutes right so she's extremely attractive and she's clad in gold and she holds a cup it's very graphic imagery that has nothing but the consequences of her fornication in it is this I mean I guess I will just say it recently there's been a number of posts on EX of this woman who had sex with 100 men in a day um and now and now she's saying she's going to have sex with a thousand men in a day yeah well she seems to be rethinking her plan given the emotional consequences she had to her last success yeah I I must say her mother is her finance officer speechless um that's for sure I'm speechless my my um response to the uh her kind of um Post 100 men thing um was it was hard for me to know to what extent that was part of the the uh per whatever performance whatever it was you know so um it was hard for me to discern what was really going on there I'm not a psychologist um but anyone who saw that would say um this is a pretty dark situation it's way darker than anybody who wanted to hold on to their sanity would possibly imagine what's also dark and I'm not saying this from a place of moral judgment I'm just saying this from a place of just kind of like a wow like this woman obviously um navigating life in this way her choice clearly um but the fact that so many people know about this the fact that so many PE and here we're talking about it but I think in service to a greater good I certainly believe like like that this is now out out there right it's out there um just like seeing somebody just like seeing somebody murder somebody in Cold Blood we we talk about that recently a video of of an assassination that and those had been available before but um those two things kind of leveled up or leveled down you know um one's idea of of what humans are capable of by allowing so many acceptable what's acceptable or desirable that's right the threshold shifted that's for sure maybe that's the what I'm looking for the threshold shifted yeah okay so that's a great example that that that young woman who's betrayed herself in the deepest possible Manner and all of the people that are following her and all the young women who are influenced by her so you have this figure on the back of the degenerate State that's the degenerate feminine female sexuality commoditize commoditized when the masculine State degenerates that's a sign of the end of things and that makes perfect sense because well why wouldn't female sexuality commoditize when the masculine is no longer reliable it's exactly what you'd expect you know how the story ends there's another element to it the degenerate state offers the of Babylon as enticement for its degeneration you can have everything you want on the sexual side at the end of that substory the state the Beast kills the prostitute and so what that means is that the long-term consequences of sacrific less sexual satiety is that sexuality itself is destroyed and I think we're seeing that in our society now 30% of Japanese under the age of 30 are virgins right about about the same in South Korea right the birth rates in those countries have plummeted like they're way way below replacement and and increasingly 50% of women in in the west are childless at 30 birth rates are way way down and and going down as well 50% are childless half of them will never have a child because 30 is already pushing it and 95% of them will regret it we're already in a situation in the west where one in Four Women will be involuntarily childless right and so it's so well that's a good example as I said earlier of how these things are characterized in this symbolic language that outlines the starkest you might say the starkest of biological realities you said that there was a problem you know your sense was that there was a problem with effortless gratification it's like well the problem part of the problem with effortless gratification is it destroys itself and it's so interesting because the promise of the sexual Revolution and the pill was an unlimited Horizon of sexual opportunity okay we know but the actual consequence of that was appears to be that that that's that's the pathway to the demise of sexuality itself this was if you can't be with the one you love Love the One You're With the uh someone I know who was a uh in their 20s in the 1970s explained to me I always thought that song was about you know if you can't be with the the person that you you love you know you find someone else you can love they explain to me that's not what that was about that was about the wildness of the of the 70s right that promise yeah that was about the the sort of the um just uh promiscuity had emerged as a as a theme of the 1970s yeah well I mean in the aftermath of the birth control pill it was not surprising that people thought maybe that was possible but that was wrong it was seriously wrong and we're going to be dealing with the consequences of that for a very long time you said that the that the patriarchy the masculine fails before the well no that happen no say that so it's not causal one no no you can't men and women degenerate at the same rate right I mean we're involved in feedback processes that are so tight that there's no like there's no oppressing women without oppressing men there's no oppressing men without oppressing women it's like we're we're joined at the hip so to speak and so you know these these these these cultures that that that cloak women and silence them you might think well that leads to the domination of men it it it just turns men into pathological tyrants like there's there's no victory over one sex that's a victory of any sense at all that's it's anti-humanity of course of course of course there was a recent um post on X that I that just held my gaze my attention um where it was a back and forth debate a pseudo political social debate and then there were three words that um I'll just to say that uh Mark Andre said you know it was it was about restoring Vigor pride and achievement and I thought wow like he's not a political candidate but that's a beautiful Trifecta Vigor pride and achievement to celebrate those and I and I put that next to you know the the Deep pleasure in generative action at a distance a technological development the Rockets um and there other Genera the theme of the story of Abraham it's like the most the highest form of potential satiation is risk risky romantic adventure it's not satiation right that's the wrong frame right and and so one of the things I've noticed this is such fun I've talked in front of I don't know how many public audiences in the last eight years independent of my professorial career and th those are large audiences um you know they must average about 3 or 4 thousand people and there's one place I go that always reduces the audience to like dead silence the audiences are usually quiet in the events you know and that's one of the ways I'm sure you know this is you want to listen to the audience you want to stay in that zone where no one's moving right cuz then you know you their attention is focused and you can hear that and you can you can I wouldn't say you can play with it not manipulatively but in the proper sense of play I learned a long while ago that Adventure let's say is the highest form of reward that's a good way of thinking about it but there's a corollary to that that conservatives need to learn because they don't know this conservatives talk about responsibility but they're conscientious and so for them responsibility is dutiful orderly productivity it's it's conscientiousness responsibility is a conscientious Duty what they fail to understand is that there's no difference between responsibility and Adventure they're the same thing and you can tell young men in particular that say look you want to have an adventure because you definitely want an adventure you're you're like you're built for that it will increase your status it will improve your life like it'll improve the probability that you'll accomplish something you want an adventure your every fiber of your being is screaming for it where do you find it you find it in the voluntary adoption of responsibility and that's that's like everyone needs to know that no young person has been taught that for like five generations this is important can we operationalize this so in your first book you talked about get your room in order yeah one of the first things I do when I wake up in the morning I look around the kitchen I look around my room and I try and get things in order yeah and I I now I need that in order to be able to think clearly but it's just a first order of business well it's also a great R it's a great morning ritual because it's often the case especially if you have a bit of a depressive tilt that it's kind of hard to get oriented properly in the morning you know and if you take like I moved into a new house a while back in in Northern Ontario and the garage wasn't set up properly and the first thing I did in the morning was I went out in the garage for 10 minutes and 10 minutes isn't very long but I would like order one thing you know part of the tool box or whatever and like if you do that every day Things fall into order pretty quickly but it was a real relief to me in some way because I didn't have to think about what I was going to do when I woke up I made my bed and then I went and fixed the garage for like 10 minutes and you get the brain into this into what I call linear operations like the ability to carry out something linearly when there's an near infinite number of options in your phone in the in your in your physical space I think is so powerful because it's an antidote to chaos a Target absolutely certainly isn't a sinful Target you at Le and you know it's not sin to clean your room or to organize your space or or the garage so so you start with it so within the day one can do that in terms of I um I really uh love the the stickiness the positive stickiness of this idea that adventure and responsibility are the same thing well well let's let's take that apart because it's it's not immediately obvious but look when you go let's say say you go see an adventure movie James Bond movie you know classic archetypal action adventure movie with some romance thrown in there um what is he doing well difficult things he's trying to solve crimes he's trying to catch bad guys yeah he's trying to battle with the forces of chaos that undermine the international order right I mean it's it's high order adventure and he's putting himself at substantive risk to do that that that's the sacrificial element to it but everybody's gripped by it well why because the stakes are high what does it mean for the stakes to be high it means the outcome matters what does that mean it means it's a life and death situation like none of that makes itself present without the hoisting of a burden and here's something else I figured out so remarkable so I went to the Church of the Holy sepulture in Jerusalem which is the first church that was the first Christian Church that was establish lished and hypothetically it was established on the location of the crucifixion right and so at the center of the church is an altar and at the center of the altar is the image of this crucifixion right which is a sacrificial image okay crucifixion sacrificial image altar church then around the church is the community and then that becomes the pattern for European towns right and all the towns that everyone wants to go visit in Europe have that pattern okay so why well responsible sacrific is at the core of the community that's what's dramatized in all that in that architecture in that in that sacred architecture in the actual in in the in the structure of the community with its Center well of course sacrifice is the center of the community obviously because Community is a sacrificial gesture like in so far as you're not all about what you want right now you're offering up a sacrifice of what it is that you want right now to the Future and the community clearly and now that's going to integrate you psychologically it's going to integrate the society and make it productive and it's so interesting that we acted that out for that proposition out for well the whole at least in so far as you're talking about Christian oriented civilization for the last 2,000 years without ever really noticing that we were dramatizing the proposition that sacrifices at the center of the community it's like obviously well what are we to make of you know cities like San Francisco which I grew up just south of and it you know by any standard it's a beautiful city I know people are going to like roll their some people roll their eyes I mean you have the bay on one side you have the ocean on the other it has magnificent Bridges I mean it's a it's a testament to what's possible in a city in terms of diverse Landscapes Etc but the downtown the center of the city is just Beyond anybody's sense of of of De indecency to walk down in the in the afternoon hours let alone at night so that at this point you you wonder like is the center really the center I mean you you literally have to avoid the center of the city in order to get away from any of that and and it's very yeah the question is so you're you're asking a symbolic question in some ways like you're asking what is the nature of the relationship between the the state of society in general and the fact that the centers of cities have deteriorated well those aren't unrelated not in the least they're very tightly related because the center does not hold right what's the famous poem from the 1920s the center is loosened right and mere chaos is around mere chaos is set upon the world I haven't got the quote precisely right that was TS Elliott he knew that when when the center pillar disintegrates then everything falls into chaos that's one of the oldest realizations of of humankind the question might be what has caused the degeneration of this of the center well man you could think about that the whole culture war is meditation on exactly that question you know there's an insistence on the postmodern side so the postmodernists they figured out that we see the world through a story they were right and and that's a devastating blow to the empiricists and the rationalists because they were wrong we do not build our knowledge in consequence of an aggregation of facts that's not how it works and a story is something like the prioritization of the world of facts I heard recently that that religion teaches through story philosophy teaches through um language that is divorced of story and that science is designed to try and remove itself from language almost entirely I mean you'd love to just present graphs and figures but you have to explain what's in those right there's a discussion there's some conclusions but the idea is that as scientists we're supposed to be objective and just interpret the data as they stand to not and to not only be informed by the fact to not INF a story but but story is the the the way that the brain works right I mean beginning middle end um it's also the thing is the story creeps into science in in what would you say unavoidably so here let me give you an example so I read a book once that was written by an X KGB agent who talked about a lab in the in the Soviet Union where there had was a dreadful accident at one point that resulted in the death of about 500 people they were trying to produce an amalgam of um Ebola and small pox yikes and then to aerosolize it oh goodness okay now look from a strictly scientific perspective value free there's no difference between pursuing that branch of knowledge and pursuing any other now you say well that's preposterous it's like yeah yes but it's Preposterous because we know that you can have an evil scientist I mean Jesus that's the Trope of how many movies is evil scientist a uses evil scientist as a Trope like the bad guy is almost always an evil scientist right so it's not like we don't know this so that science itself which is the value free pursuit of facts can be an evil Enterprise if you're a good scientist the story is always lurking in the background like why are you conducting your investigation well I want to understand more about the human psyche well why well I want to be of Aid to the human Enterprise I want to make things better that's the story I want to pursue truth in a manner that makes things better that's the story part well you and you might say well that's self-evidence like it's only self-evident when it's working properly when it's not working properly things get bad quick so there were scientists in Unit 731 when the Japanese invaded China and you cannot read about what they did without without traumatizing yourself permanently for the rest of your life right what happened with Unit 731 it's the worst human atrocity I've ever seen by a lot and that was the scientific Enterprise gone astray let's say it has to be encapsulated within a value structure and the question is well what's the appropriate value structure we're starting to figure that out because you know I talked to Richard Dawkins about this a little bit one of the things that disheartens Dawkins is that as the humanistic Enterprise has progressed and as the atheistic impulse has made itself more manifest The Assault on science and logic at the universities has intensified cuz his notion was if we could just free oursel from the superstitions of the past everyone would become like a hybrid between let's say Newton and bacon and dekart it's like no it turns out that when you destabilize the underlying story everybody becomes a narcissistic immature psychopath and they don't make good scientists and like the evidence for that is kind of Stark because I'm sure you've observed like I've observed that over the last 20 years the scientific Enterprise has become a lot less reliable than it was well for a number of reasons I mean one of the primary ones in my opinion um and I'm familiar with the scientific Community is that that that a lot of science is built on lineages and you know who your advisers were and so forth it relates to funding Etc and it used to be that the primary value with within and across lineages was to seek out new territory I could tell a lot of stories that would take up hours about great advisers telling their students to move into new territories which sounded like get out of my field I'm going to demolish you but instead what they were encouraging them to do was to go on let's use your language New Adventures of responsibility New Frontier but instead what's happened is that 95% of the scientists in a given subfield all work on similar problems pin medals on each other validate each other fund each other and as a consequence there are a lot of untouched problems that will hopefully it somay someday be investigated the other consequence is that this debacle within the field of Alzheimer's in dementia where one laboratory fudges data and you kind of wonder if I mean that's not my subfield but I you step back from there you go how the hell this progress for 15 years where everyone was you know like the emperor has no clothes like everyone agreeing that this is the stuff to work on when when in fact the data were falsified and people knew people knew so what that means is that it's like it's like bad family values passed on through generations and these I do think these are well-meaning people along the line but yeah yes and no little a little bit uh intense on the career formulation side of things well so right the careerist aspect as opposed to the scientist aspect well well that exist too well let let's think about let's think about that critically it's like science is a very weird Endeavor because in order to actually be a scientist you have to put discovering that you're wrong before demonstrating that you're right and that is hard on your career in the short term like if you play that game and you're good at it you can discover something real but that's going to take a while and it's not certain right it's not at all surprising that people would subvert an Enterprise that difficult to the narrow demands of career enhancement it's exactly what you'd expect unless there was a stunningly powerful counterveiling force and that force was powerful enough let's say from 1550 to 1980 so that science worked but that's a short period of time and it's only happened once and we don't know what conditions had to be in place for people to actually like seriously prioritize the truth seriously because that's what a serious scientist does and so it's not surprising that it would degenerate into something like Dynasty and nepotism that's exactly what you'd expect that's the historical Norm so then you might think well what are the preconditions that have to be in place as narrative foundation for there to be at least some some people that are prioritizing the truth I think one needs to reward true adventure and Novelty taking on novel problems and you know these days it's so hard for a scientist to birth an entire New Field and yet there are huge huge sets of untapped problems the the challenge for them is it's difficult to get funding to take on things that are truly new you know there's a lot of discussion these days about challenges with the NIH Etc I think that the biggest challenge regardless of the size of the budget which is also you know an issue that needs to be dealt with and where where it's spent is that we tend to reward science that's already completed that fits with the current narrative and it's very incremental they reward incremental science whereas great science comes through taking great risk and people like you said holding the truth Above All Else and being willing to stake their careers on it and we need to actually reward failure if it involved effort to solve things correctly in other words give give young scientists funding and encourage them to go after novel problems and understand that most of them will fail and that doesn't necessarily mean that they have to be exited out of the University give them a new novel problem to tackle problem is there's so much pressure and you know because you're University Professor I know you know in order to reach tenure you need to you need to reduce the entropy as much as possible in any event I without going down that path too too far I now um understand why you're saying that science in has to invoke story that Mak has to be embedded that makes sense that makes sense otherwise well science is the handmaiden of some story there's no way around that because motivation is the handmaiden of some story and so the motivational framework has to be put in place accurately and the motivational framework for scientific inquiry is very stringent truth above all right so if you state your whole goddamn career on a particular hypothesis and you run a critical study and it turns out that the reason you're famous is invalid you have to publish that why the hell would you do that right and the answer has to be because you hold the truth in relationship to human flourishing higher than the Integrity of your own even your own self valuation well man that's a very diff that's a very difficult thing to establish now you can do that with young scientists to some degree because you can help them understand that as a medium to long-term game there's nothing better than pursuit of the truth and so that's worth a risk it's worth a risk because you can be spectacularly successful if you pursue the truth it's unlikely like it's unlikely to be a successful entrepreneur but if you get it right man you like you've hit the mother load right and you don't want to falsify your data because you want to spend your whole life pursuing something that doesn't exist because you will talk yourself into belief that your falsifications are true and then you'll warp the whole field as you said you Illustrated that in relationship to Alzheimer's disease like you can instill love of the truth in in your students but you have to believe that's a story too you have to believe that the truth will set you free right and that's a religious presumption in the final analysis serve truth it's the best long-term strategy it's the best adventure that's a good thing to know too it's the best adventure so I made a triumvirate of Truth responsibility and Adventure saying they're the same thing and I figured it out with regard to truth too truth is an adventure because if you what would you say vow to follow the path of the truth you have to let go of the predictability of the outcome right now if I wanted to manipulate you in some way I would craft my strategy for this podcast a priority and then I would tilt the podcast toward that end right and I could be more or less sophisticated at that or I could just say we're going to follow the thread wherever it goes and I'm going to accept the outcome and I'm going to presume that the outcome is the best outcome that could possibly have been even if I don't see why okay why is that an adventure because if I let go of my predetermined goal I don't know what's going to happen and that's exciting it's right cuz don't know well that's the that's the essence of Adventure it's like you're bounding over the Uncharted sea let's say and you don't know what's going to happen next well why would you exchange that for like a kind of banel predictability well to build your career to I mean I understand why but you're foregoing what's truly valuable for something that's second rate for something that's secure that's what Abraham did it's like you know it's better to have the adventure why the hell wouldn't you want that so he left what was indulgent he had everything for what was truly generative in service to something larger and dangerous and dangerous like he ends up as a warrior at one point he has to raise an army to rescue his nephew from the hands of tyrants it's like you know all the adventures of Life get thrown at him but it turns out that that's what he wants he wants all the adventures of life to be thrown at him and that is what everyone wants and I think that is you know the idea that when you go watch the Lord of the Rings for example or The Hobbit you're seeing the characterization of human personality dramatized like obviously right that's like a truism but you have to think about what that means it's like The Hobbit is Abraham it's exactly the same story and that story is the story of the that's the genuine identity of the individual and the promise is is that if you aim up and you live in the spirit of the truth you'll have the Redemptive adventure of your life and that'll be of such significance that it'll justify the suffering that's intrinsic to life and I think that's right I mean when when you look at your own life I mean you're you're on an adventure you have this podcast it's ridiculously successful right in a way that I'm sure you couldn't have imagined how long five years ago yeah we we are about to hit the end of four years in a couple weeks we've been we launched in January 2021 no no premonition could have seen this or for I had no concept that it would become what it's become right okay and so what what's the existential consequence of that like you know I mean everyone's life is rif with the possibility of suffering and now you have something exciting and generative to do why is that working I mean existentially why does that work you know people will ask me what's next where are you headed and I would just say you know like on well on Friday I'm talking to Jordan Peterson and I'm focused on that all week long and next week I'm recording a solo podcast C about whatever it happens to be I just believe that's setting my sights on the proximal and I just believe in um I know my my deep deep deep love of finding organizing and disseminating information that I hope will be useful to people okay so that's it that's that's what that's the driving force behind all of it really okay so great so so I would say I don't think that that Proclamation I don't think is any different any different from the notion of identity with the Redeeming Word that's the same idea cuz you said generated generating ideas right information and disseminating it right so that's like it's valid inquiry and and dissemination of the consequences okay your claim is that that's highly intrinsically motivating oh yeah right okay so then I Delight I Delight in it I it's hard sometimes I mean it's I was trying to read a really difficult paper yesterday it's hard but it it feels so good okay so then we might say well what's what what's the basis for that intrinsic pleasure we think about that biologically well you could imagine it as a manifestation of the Instinct that integrates right it integrates you across time it integrates you with other people across time right and there's a marker for that why wouldn't you find your how could it be otherwise then you would find your deepest satisfaction in pursuing the course of action that integrates you psychologically and integrates other people socially like that would assume that there's a concordance between your deepest self-interest and the interest of your society and it better be that way because otherwise you couldn't Thrive as an individual in society so it better be that way and we've been doing this for a very long time as human beings so why we wouldn't have an instinct to mark that pathway and of course we'd find our deepest satisfaction in that I mean once you once you see these issues through that light they become I think painfully obvious so because that also because the contrary hypothesis is absurd it's like you're going to find deep satisfaction what rejecting knowledge and if you do happen to stumble across a nugget you're going to hoard it for yourself right well right right exactly it's laughable it's clearly laughable No One Believes that earlier we were talking about operationalizing um this uh the effort the calling to move from potential chaos to order starts with organizing one's physical space if we were to you know extend the um the the rings of the bullseye out a little bit further for people listening who are trying to figure out like what where where do they receive that calling how how do they find their calling that like where so responsibility and Adventure being perhaps the um the the compass through which we can you know like navigate there so they think like well where can they um grab a hold of their responsibility and and then as a consequence of doing that engage in adventure and have an impact that is good for them and good for the world that that's how do how do they find that I think there's ve there's very practical answers to those questions so two of the most two of the highest order characterizations of the Divine in the biblical library is calling and conscience and you could think about those you could think about those as integrated manifestations of positive and negative emotion so imagine there's a pathway forward to your aim okay your negative emotion tells you when you deviate from the pathway and your positive emotion tells you when you're progressing along the pathway okay now imagine that there's a voice of your integrated positive emotion and there's a voice of your integrated negative emotion calling that's what fills you with enthusias iasm and that root word of that is Theos right deos that's God calling conscience okay so now that beckons you forward so how do you find that some things bother you those are your problems and you might think I don't want to have any problems it's like no you've got some problems you can tell that cuz those things bug you that's your conscience calling you to your destiny those problems okay calling there's some things that interest you right and you don't get to pick them exactly they just sort of make themselves manifest like the burning bush did to Moses cuz that's an example that's the symbolic representation of calling it's the dynamism between calling and conscience that orients people upwards right that's the pillar of flame and the pillar of Darkness that guides the Israelites across the desert when they're lost calling beckons conscience provides disciplinary limitations that's a good way of thinking about it so you can see that some things are good you ask yourself what bothers me about me okay now you have a domain you think well man some of those things I just I don't know how to fix them fine don't fix them fix some of the things you could fix that's that we talked about that or make your goddamn bed in the morning like you could do that and it's like you see people their lives are so chaotic like they're their living environment every single bit of it is a catastrophic mess some sometimes multiple Generations deep it's just chaos everywhere it's like where do you start dealing with chaos wherever you can put something in order by your own standards of order and then see what happens because what'll happen is now you got a little like little corner of order and now you're a little more well situated and then you'll be able to see what the next what's the next step and you might think well it looks hopeless because there's just chaos everywhere it's like it's okay hey because the process is exponential so even if you start nowhere if you keep doubling you're going to get somewhere and faster than you think and well the same thing applies when you're plummeting into the abyss un degenerative stuff a colleague of mine who he's geneticist said you know it takes many many many generations to evolve a species it doesn't take very many to devolve a species mut negative mutations can build on another and crash a species very very fast I think our psyche is is similar in that way well that's an anthropic problem there's way more ways to make something complex worse than there are to make it better right that's why it's a straight and narrow path my father came to this country from Argentina and he grew up in a lot of uh surrounded by a lot of political chaos came to the country became a physicist probably because he likes order he's a very orderly Guy and um it was probably in the early 90s that we went I was born in 75 so probably yeah early 90s that we went to a movie theater uh together to see a movie and he said it as we were walking in he said look and I said what and he said this is the beginning of the end and I said what do you mean he said we're degenerating as a society and I said why and he said there are people here in their pajamas right right and obviously they weren't in their pajamas but they come in in kind of like bath you know bathroom slippers and they like they weren't slovenly but they weren't taking care of themselves clearly worse worse care what other people thought right that's right they were making a public display of their lack of care right exactly EXA that's a narcissistic aspect to that too yeah yeah he's right about that and I thought at the time like he's being judgmental I was a teen right he's being judgmental Etc and um but you know I would say from 1990 until fairly recently hopefully things are shifting for the better now but um there has seemed to be it's kind of chaos out there now I think it's wonderful that people can express themselves by wearing clothes that they feel represent them Etc but this wasn't that this was a lack of care look voluntary the what would you say the evocation of voluntary chaos that's one thing the degeneration into chaos through sloth let's say that's not an adventure that's carelessness in all things masquerading as an adventure I'm so cool I don't care it's like you're not cool you're just useless and you're covering your uselessness with a veneer of revolutionary morality it's like there's nothing in that that's up like if people want to deviate in the manner they present themselves in dress and they're doing that because they have a inspiration or a purpose then that's completely different than just being so cool you don't care and that's not cool there's nothing about that that's cool and you know you might say and you had this sense when you were a kid that your dad was overreacting it's like yeah well if you look you can see things before other people see them and he and he came from a place that had gone through a fair number of very rough times and so he could have been perfectly accurate in what he saw highly likely that's another example of the center disintegrating right where do you think we are now in uh in the United States I think right in terms of how we represent hold and represent order versus chaos I mean we were talking about some of the you know this uh these social media posts recently we just had a a public public display of an assassination maybe you know I hadn't intended on going there but I think it's worth talking about um it was weird I got pulled into this through tangential reasons this Luigi manion's last tweet was a podcast cover of of my episode with Jonathan height um and some media Outlets tried to make something of that you know but clearly he was very smart clearly he had for thought to his actions he 3D printed this gun gun it seems is all alleged now but it seems to be pointing that direction he seems to not want the police to go investigate anybody else you know because he claims there's no one else acting with him Etc he um clearly was trying to make a statement but the statement was was a combination of statements about the the um Insurance system um sort of anti-establishment because of his affinity for uh kazinski unibomber bombings but at the same time he uh he didn't really seem to fall into kind of left leaning or right leaning politics squarely he was kind of all over the place so you're you're a trained clinician you think there's some schizotypal or schizophrenic type organization there in his head or lack of organization I mean what are we to make of this and we and we had to see somebody assassinated shot in the back multi guess I would say the first thing I would be looking for is pathological narcissism I disordered thought possibly but he was quite successful academically like the typical pattern for something like schizophrenic dis dissolution is very very much difficulty in maintaining so discipline striving in a highly intellectual atmosphere for examp he a valedictorian he went to school graduated i' think more luciferian grandiosity and the intellect is particularly prone to that you know the the the the archetypal representation of the intellect that overreaches is Lucifer right God's God's highest Angel gone most catastrophically wrong which means that the best thing in its place is the worst thing on the top that happens with sexuality it can happen with aggression it certainly happens with the intellect and so I think he's a worshipper of his own intellect and believed that he was the guy who could make the decision even of life and death which means he took onto himself the role of ultimate judge and that's what the kid who shot up Coline did too and said in his own writings he's the judge and that's like narcissistic Beyond Comprehension and the fact that he's being celebrated well that's an echo of that moralizing narcissism that's deeply embedded in our culture deeply embedded and so yeah it's a very ugly it's very ugly I see so we're going to what we're now vigilantes in relationship to the corporate World judge jury and executioner and the reason we've taken on that rule is because we unlike let's say the people who run healthc care Enterprises we truly care for the sick and oppressed it's like do you know do you know yeah there's so much moralizing in our culture it's beyond it's really beyond belief I was going to say all these CEOs now are going to need personal security that's hardly going to you know cause them to adjust their you know premiums or something downward I mean I think as people get more scared they tend to uh you know up double yeah they tend to double down I mean earlier we were talking about action at a distance I mean clearly um this Manion guy has is aware High status so ignored or notorious there's a hard choice for young men they'll pick notorious many of them will and no wonder because status is everything it's hard to do good things over long periods time right it's not hard to be good it's just hard to do big it's hard to do good things it's hard to do big things I mean I think that's one reason why I'm very happy that Elon is being celebrated you don't have to agree with him politically but the Rockets going the idea of going to Mars trying to U make sure that our our species replaces itself I mean these are Big important Endeavors I mean I the reason well and he can clearly do them I mean he's he's been insanely successful doing five possible things simultaneously right that's not fluke no right once probably not fluke even once but you know the probability that it's fluke once is higher five times no that's that's a reputation right and so he's a he's a from first principal sort of guy so yeah I wouldn't bet against Elon Musk so and that is independent of his political stance and is it ult to do good things well it's hard it's hard it's hard it's hard to do long-term good things because they're longterm that's what I was trying to say right but it's also intensely the thing is it's also this is that back to that issue of the relationship between responsibility and Adventure it's like if the aim is true the voyage is worthwhile and so and that happens right away like you know you're very successful with your podcast but my suspicion are you've deeply enjoyed it since its onset well so so well that means that some of your pleasure is satiation related you've become successful but if that was your aim you would have failed as a podcaster because definely podast I definitely would have failed oh definitely oh absolutely 100% because it wasn't the pursuit of pleasure per se it's sort of like the difference between you know is it easier to be the class clown or um the top of the class it's just much easier to be the class clown all you have to do is crack 10 jokes one of them hits you know and you're you're safe but you're you're actually dissolving as you go right right right well that's the prioritization of the short term over the long run I mean Rogan's a perfectly appropriate example because he's sort of like the archetype of the successful podcaster it's like what's Joe doing well he's doing what he's always done he sits down with his producer one guy and he talks to people he wants to talk to about things he wants to talk to them about that's the whole thing the whole and it's you know the left the lefties who refused to talk to people in the podcast world for 10 years are now proclaiming to everyone who listen that they should have built their own you know alternative media apparatus and they could have participated in the one that exists now at any time had they shown the least proclivity to do so how it's not such an easy thing to build because it wasn't something that Joe built it was something that happened around him in consequence of the nature of his Pursuit and that's the case for virtually all the successful podcasters I think people forget how Joe's podcast started do you you might know this story I'll keep it brief but um he was a comedian at The Comedy Store he had done some television and things of that sort but um and people can find this online the videos are on YouTube where a comedian was stealing Ari shaffir's jokes so Joe got up on stage and said there's a there's a um there's some ethics in the comedy community people can buy jokes but you you don't steal jokes apparently and there's an etiquette as well so apparently he confronted this guy in front of the audience and said you're stealing his jokes and the guy challenged him and Joe said no like Joe was stood up in the name of justice for a friend of his and my understanding could be wrong about this but my understanding is that Joe was then banished from that particular particular Comedy Club so what did he do he went home he popped open his laptop and he and Brian Redban and a few other folks started what eventually became the Joe Rogan podcast it came out of a um an Impulse to stand up for the truth which I think is an important thing for people to understand because it helps you understand Joe um need be uning in that yeah yeah and and I think yeah and you know he doesn't claim to always be right but his um his pursuit of the truth has um been a driving force for the podcast he claims consistently to not be sufficiently right that's why he listens and asks questions you don't ask genuine questions if you believe that you already know everything you only ask real questions if you don't think that you know enough and Joe wouldn't be perennially attractive to his audiences if he wasn't asking the same questions that the audience would like to have answered right he's genuinely curious absolutely well musk himself said you know when when I interviewed him he talked about a terrible existential crisis that he had when he was 13 14 which is not atypical of you know out people with outstanding intellects let's say um and he resolved that by recognizing that the quest is the source of meaning and so he took it upon himself self to confront difficult problems and try to solve them and he found that to be sufficiently gratifying so his existential crisis resolved itself and that's very much the same pattern that Rogan is exemplifying and you in your Pursuits and you can see what impact it has on the public you know and we were I was talking with one of your staff members before this podcast about your lectures say in Australia and so you're in the weird position where 5,000 people come and listen to a biologist lecture spontaneously for what 90 minutes like what the hell well that's just an indication of how compelled people are by anything approximating a genuine Quest it doesn't even matter the direction right it matters the commitment and that capacity to explore and transmit and that is a manifestation of the word that redeems I love this idea or what you just said that it doesn't even so M so much matter the direction as much as the commitment a colleague of mine at Stanford who I um respect tremendously Anna lmy who wrote the book dopamine Nation she's the head of our dual diagnosis Addiction Center she was the one who really truly deserves credit for bringing dopamine into the public discussion over the last few years she initiated that talking about how big inflections in dopamine that are very fast that aren't preceded by effort AKA drugs of abuse behavioral addictions Etc leave us below Baseline with our dopamine and then people will engage in more of the behavior it drives us further and further and further that's kind of the the principle of it um I was talking to her about how people get sober and the conversation turned to how do young people find their purpose it was it was very interesting she said let's talk about finding purpose everyone nowadays wants to know what their purpose is and she said the way you find your purpose is by going out on your front lawn and seeing if the leaves need to be raped sounds familiar right you find purpose by um figuring out how you can be of use at progressively larger and larger spheres away from yourself and in doing that and the present and in doing that you start to hear the calling and you find your purpose and it as you said or it reveals itself to you the same thing right yeah so I think you two would be enjoy a conversation at some point important thing to return to because people are often curious about what to do practically it's like okay first this is what Jacob does Jacob in Old Testament stories he eventually becomes Israel right and so that's his name and Israel means we who wrestle with God now Jacob is a bad guy when the story starts and he leaves his home and the perverse influence of his mother and his criminal betraying past behind and he decides that he's going to aim up and that night he makes an altar and he makes a sacrifice and that night he has a dream of a staircase that reaches up to heaven which is now what he's walking up right and so he finds his his purpose he finds his Adventure as a consequence of his decision to be better okay so now you want to find your purpose okay first thing you have to do you have to review how wretched and miserable you actually are and you have to face that and then you have to think I'd rather not have that and it has to be true and then you have to aim up now you don't know what that means because like you're pretty scattered and dissolute but at least you got the damn intent in mind and then you have to be willing to make the sacrifices right along the way okay then what happens well then the pathway will reveal itself to you in increments calling is there something around here that I could fix that I would fix that's a great question is there something hand that I could fix that I would fix it might be something low cuz especially when you first get going you're not good for anything so you might have to start with something pretty trivial but it doesn't matter because you start getting better is there something that bothers me that's conscience that I could set right in some small way well that's there for everyone right in the midst of the most catastrophic mess that pathway you might even say look The More Mess Around you the more unstructured possibility you have it had and it's true you know it's like I'm not trying to be a poly an Ana about this I know how difficult that is but it is the case that the more mess at hand that you can see the more opportunity that's there CU well if you can see that it's a mess then you can see the pathway to to cleaning it up well so do it do it see what happens that's the adventure what's going to happen in my class I my maps of meeting class I used to have students do this as a project and one of the projects was find something around you in your neighborhood wherever in your family that isn't set right and see if you could set it right just write down what happens well one student in particular he decided his mother had died and the family kind of fragmented and so he decided he would take try to take on the role of mother you know be responsible for the household operating well grew him up like mad as you can imagine he ran into all sorts of weird resistances right cuz his family was upset that he was doing what mom used to do and like he just had a tremendously complex Adventure as a consequence of his willingness to pursue this was obviously necessary because the alternative was that his family was going to fall apart it's like that's there for everyone you say well my circumstances are so difficult it's like fair enough so are everybody else's by the way but that means there's a lot of man yes I fix it a bit and that's ridiculously entertaining and unpredictable and that in itself is a great deal you have no idea what's going to happen just like you didn't know what happened when you started the podcast why' you start it I had it for me I felt a compulsion um to share what I knew but because during the pandemic everyone was so focused on vaccines and lockdowns that no one was talking about the reality that everyone was facing including sorry Josh Gordon I know him through time um our director of the National Institute sub mental health not a single thing out there about hey folks if you're going to be indoors this much get some sunlight in your eyes in the morning or else you're going to have trouble sleeping trouble sleeping equates to mental health issues stress uncertainty my lab was working on ways to regulate stress through deliberate breathing through other mechanisms it was like well I want people to have tools zero cost tools to deal with their stress us to help them regulate their circadian biology because those Wick out to countering the negative forces that were on us which are social order was disrupted people are at home so it was a desire to give people tools that I knew existed that I was knowledgeable about and I had a a longstanding kind of and growing compulsion that I wanted to talk about Neuroscience because it's so darn cool right okay so it's a logical there there was a lot of energy behind the the the mission but then there was a calling the calling was from hearing about people suffering it's like well of course you're not sleeping well I mean not only are there a million things to worry about right now people aren't working Etc but you're not getting sunlight in your eyes you need to get outside you need to you know and then there's the whole socialization thing and look whatever people's circumstances there are things that they could do and so I felt that calling and my conscience told me that I have the knowledge so why would why would I Cloister it cloer with it at home that's like what good is that so I just started blabbing on the internet right right that's yeah well that's a that's a perfectly you know you can think well that's a logical extension of your subsidiary calling to be a teacher and a professor you're already a researcher you're already a professor so you're investigating and transmitting knowledge it's like well looks like you could do that on a broader scale and the technolog is there why not explore that that's a perfectly reasonable and you can see the interplay of calling and conscience there that's a lovely way of characterizing the voice of the Divine which is is how it's characterized repeated Elijah Elijah is the prophet who is appears with Christ when he's transfigured on the mount in the New Testament it's Elijah and Moses Elijah is the first person in human history who identifies the Divine with conscience that's his contribution that's a major psychological Revolution right it's an unheralded transformation in understanding it's like it's not the storm it's not the forest fire it's not the earthquake it's not the god of nature nature he's the originator of the phrase the still Small Voice right like that's a that the notion that you're conscience is the voice of the Divine my God there's there's there's virtually no dis no Discovery there's no proposition more revolutionary than that and so that's why Elijah is a prophet of you know primary status and I just see no reason at all not to take that claim seriously it's like you come up with an explanation for your conscience it tells you things you don't want to hear so how is that you I I mean you have to gerrymander the definition of you for that to be you no I absolutely believe that things come from outside of us certainly for me and I you know I I'm now very much a devotee of prayer I pray before this podcast what do you pray well before this podcast I prayed for um Clarity of mind to be able to um to learn from you and to help transmit that knowledge to people in a way that would be useful to them yeah to um for sustained Focus for um for the ability to also let go and and not try and control or or lead with questions and to um and to allow the the um a sense of of Randomness and Serendipity to to make it what it what it is in trusting that it's in service to the the listeners right well that's a very that's a very precise and properly formulated prayer yeah I pray before every podcast I pray before going to sleep Beach and I've been doing this for about um for a little over a year I always quietly SEC secret why why did you decide to do that my coming to the whole notion of prayer and God Etc um was complicated in the backdrop in the sense that I always secretly prayed um always secretly secretly prayed and then about a year about a year and a half ago a guy that works on my security team um started talking to me about the Bible we started talking about God and it made sense I started reading the Bible I'm not through it yet um and I started praying and I had a number of experiences as a consequence of praying clearly as a consequence of of prayer that made me realize that prayer doesn't give me a capacity of any sort it just allows certain things that I believe are inside of me to to uh to come out and for proper prayer establishes aim yeah that's right oh yeah well why wouldn't you establish your aim like why wouldn't you take a moment before you start your podcast to remember what the hell you're trying to accomplish and to have it firmly in mind yeah and and it felt different so I should say that you know I I have this little list that I sometimes do I'll say you know uh deliberate breathing AK breath work can allow you to shift your state hypnosis is a tool that can allow you to solve a particular problem because it has some you know aspect of neuroplasticity we there um non-sleep deep rest which is a thing that was you know built out of this this practice called yoga nedro where you go into a an awake but deeply relaxed state allows you to restore your Vigor meditation to me is a way of of enhancing one's ability to focus you know a thirde eyye meditation of concentrating your breath Etc I mean we know based on the data improves Focus prayer to me is entirely different than all of those there's some overlap that they they they look similar some of them look similar from the outside prayer is the the for me is the allowing of something from TR truly outside me to come through me and bring out the best it in me and that's why I pray for four things I pray for Ability I pray for other people and I also have learned that a powerful aspect of prayer is just listening because just stopping and listening and trying to um invite in or allow in messages that um if I didn't steal myself that I wouldn't here and sometimes I'll go to sleep and then the next morning something will will come to mind it's not always immediate well I don't think there's any real difference between that and Revelation so imagine that um what speaks to you in intuition is the voice of your aim now this this would be this would be true if your thoughts and the images that appear to you are tools so to speak to orient you towards your destination well obviously they have to be that because if your thoughts and your Visions let's say didn't Orient you towards your destination they would be useless and you'd never get anywhere okay so now you specify your aim and it is the voice of that aim that will make itself manifest to you that is what a revelation is and one of these days when we have a podcast I'd like to sit down and talk to you about the relationship the formal relationship between thought and prayer because I think thought is secularized prayer I'm I I we looked at it histo because like when did we start to think that's not so obvious you know I mean we started to think in words after we developed the ability to use language what's that 1 15,000 years maybe it's longer than that no one really knows but thought has its historical Origins the probability that it emerged from something like prayer as far as I can tell is 100% but I'd like to at some point it's complicated but I'd like to have a discussion with you about that so imagine that to have an in to have an informative intuition means that you posit a question like and that's a form of humility it's like there's something I need to know that I don't know that I could know that I'd like to know it's like so you set the stage well once you set the stage the probability that a creative idea will enter the theater of your imagination is much enhanced that's the first stage of Revelation then you have to assess that that's discriminating the spirits you might say you're separating the wheat from the chaff that's critical thinking but all of that as far as I can tell is something approximating secularized prayer set your aim then observe the manifestation of that aim that it's not it's not even magical it's how your perception works now there's a magic to it because I suppose the magic is that you can think up something you never thought up before how the hell do you do that it's more like you experience it right you set your aim you have a question so you're on your knees hoping for an answer the light bulb goes on well if that's not Revelation then what the hell is it it's the same thing having spent a good portion of my career digging around in brains recording from neurons slicing up brains staining brains and from my understanding of what of neuros science and I think by now in 2020 almost 2025 we have a fairly good understanding of what different brain areas do how different circuits interact um I don't see how anyone who's really interested in how humans work can um not believe in God and I'm not being disparaging of people that don't I know people that are atheists I have some in my family um and I just don't think that the human brain and mind is capable of understanding and managing itself as well as it possibly could in the absence of a concept of God in prayer and I think there's a lot of uh historical evidence to support that statement meaning that this notion of God has been around a very long time this is not a coincidence I mean humans have discarded many of the things that you know other people perhaps came up with this has been a a stable feature of Being Human for a very long time of societies for a very long time and I've been wanting to ask you um throughout today's conversation to what extent do you think the different religions and the way that they represent God differently or in the case of Christianity God and Jesus Christ to what extent do you think that the stories and the lessons and the teachings overlap at the level that we're talking about today which is really about a psychological and neuroscientific level seems to me that they all Converge on the same themes but I'm not you know I'm somewhat of a newbie to all to to formal prayer and and to reading the Bible and so on so I like to say you know I have I haven't gotten my jersey yet because I don't deserve it but I'm I'm putting in I'm showing up to practice you know this kind of thing so I'm just curious to what extent you see consistent themes across religions and maybe even to atheism too like atheism it's been argued as its own form of religion perhaps right and for anyone listening I mean I want to make clear like the there's I don't have any push back on atheism it's just that for me adopting uh really coming to terms with a a real belief in God and adopting a prayer practice every single night and also during the day many times and always before a podcast has been just tremendously beneficial to my life so that's why I'm going to continue to do it um why I wouldn't I but that's the question to what extent do different the way that different religions represent God you think across religions Converge on common themes well I think they converge substantively I mean I think the best I talked to Camille pelia about this a few years ago maybe she's she's one of the world's foremost literary theorists and she said something very interesting to me that was quite surprising she said that had the academy turned to Eric nyman who is yung's greatest student by the way instead of Fuko the whole history of of the university and the intellectual Enterprise over the last five decades would have been entirely different what happened with Fuko well Fuko is the most cited cited scholar who ever lived and Fuko believes that the story that we act out is one of power and that's wrong it and it's not just wrong it's like perversely and dangerously wrong I think it's technically wrong wrong as well as being ethically wrong partly because power does not provide a stable basis for psychological integration or social Unity it's just it's not it power might be more effective adaptively than capitulation and dependence but it's not an optimized solution not by any stretch of the imagination and I think the data demonstrating that I think it's and I outlin that in in in this book we who wrestle with God Eric neyman Carl Yung Mach eliat a host of others outlined the patterns of religious thinking and it took the most of the 20th century to do that and they found recurring themes that are profound so what one example the ancient Egyptians worshiped a god Horus everyone knows the god Horus because the his emblem is the ie the Open Eye well what does that mean it means in part that the ancient Egyptians worshiped attention and they felt that the god of attention was the antidote to the pathological State and they were right about that I mean they had a god of the pathological state that was Seth the god Seth the name Seth became Satan through the Coptic through the Coptic Christian so they believed that the degenerate state had a spirit and the antidote to the spirit of the degenerate state was the allseeing the allseeing upward striving eye and that's right it's like they nailed that sounds like what you were saying before where you set your sights where you set high and to the to the heavens and then to the most proximal thing that's going to deliver you to the next rung well and there's a difference between attention and thinking like attention is a quest if you're paying attention you're looking you're seeking you're knocking you're asking right and the Eternal promise is that if you ask you'll be answered and if you seek you'll find and it's the the ey is the gateway to that and it's the antidote to the degenerate State because the degenerate State the totalitarian state insists and tyrannizes and the open eye seeks well the Egyptians figured this out and they the Egyptian theology had a walloping impact on Jewish theology I mean the Jews came out of Egypt like there are concept that's that's a conceptu there are consequences of that conceptually as well as historically the the her the pattern of the hero's journey that's replicated I would say that's the central pattern of story per se and that makes itself manifest in perhaps all cultures that have managed any unity and any progress whatsoever is there a hierarchy of religious truth yes in just as there's a hierarchy in literary depth we understand that a a dimore romance is not as profound as a dovi novel we know there's a hierarchy of depth and you can arrange religious apprehension in terms of a hierarchy of quality and I think the Union school did that brilliantly brilliantly and biologists should know it in Far More depth the best neuroscientists of emotion and motivation that I knew and that include Yak PP they knew the the the work of ilad for example would you which of those readings would you recommend for somebody who's interested in Psychology and Neuroscience explained at that level I would start with the sacred and the profane by by ilad and also um Eric neyman's book uh the Origins and history of Consciousness that's a harder one because it's unless you know the lingo of that school it's hard to it's hard to understand what he's aiming at if you understand that he's aiming at he's he's elaborating on the symbolism of The Adventurous Spirit that's a good way of thinking about it it's a technical analysis of the structure of heroic expansion of personality but it it's an easier way in is through ilot sacred and the profane short book you could you would read it now knowing that the gods that ilad describe as Waring in the Pagan world are in part manifestations of the personality of motivational drive and the mapping of that war across times that's the war of the Gods in heaven which is a very common mythological Trope there's a war that integrates towards a monotheism and ilot to trct that in multiple cultures and that's very it's very much worth knowing because it explains it explains the symbolism of the emergence of the integrated literate human psyche across tens of thousands of years that's captured in story so imagine this here's a way of thinking about it so tribe A Tribe B tribe C now they all have their highest deity or their panoply of deities now they unite okay so as they unite they fight they compete and they cooperate they kill each other they cooperate and trade at the same time that's happening there's a war in the space of ideas between their respective deities and you could think about the human beings acting out that war just as you could think about the war the abstraction reflecting the conflict on Earth well there's a pattern to that conflict that pattern is quite stable across cultures it tilts towards a monotheistic unity in so far as the multiplicity of cultures unifies well obviously like what are they going to unify with in the absence of conceptual Unity I don't think so and why wouldn't it be that the movement towards that conceptual Unity which is the establishment of a larger scale civilization would involve the battle between ideas of the Divine and their integration into something resembling a Unity like clearly well that's part of the Proclamation let's say of the analytic psychologists that were all part of Carl school and the academy just ignored that entirely except for Camille Pia who understands this quite profoundly and went in the direction of Fuko these are these lineages that we were talking about before it's it's hard for people to appreciate just how powerful these academic lineages are and scientific lineages are because they they set trajectories I've been yeah and they Define what's forbidden like all my all the people that advised me as a graduate student even those who had my best interest firmly in mind told me to never talk about my interest in Union psychology really yeah sorry I'm laughing cuz it's so Preposterous yeah well I and and like it it it's not surprising I mean I always did when I went for job interviews and that definitely was part of what scuttled at me at some of the places I interviewed now fortunately they hired me at Harvard and so I was what I was discussing was verboten in many places but not there so you know that worked out quite nicely for I was going to say clearly it worked out I've been I've been meaning to ask you I've been reading a a really interesting book um recently that's uh Bas basically grounded in adarian Psychology yeah I'm I wasn't familiar with adarian psychology yeah Adler's very practical the book talks about Adler as a as a Counterpoint to Freud and Yung what's the book um the book is called the courage to be disliked and I highly recommend it to everybody it was actually written by Japanese author I think there are two Japanese authors it didn't get quite so popular in this country but it it had a big following um in Japan and I think in other places in uh in Asia and um the book is is set up as a conversation between essentially a philosopher at of adarian psychology and a student um who's challenging him so it's a conversation that raises all the all the challenges that one that would come to one's mind if you were to be presented with this idea of Life tasks and that we're supposed to discard with our thoughts about prior trauma and just figure out what are our tasks now right right and I I like the practicality of it Adler's very practical yeah I like that was just curious what your thoughts were about that the it seems to fit quite well with your your Notions and what you've talked about in multiple books including the most recent one um the one that's out now about getting really serious about what your tasks are at this moment in time and embracing those tasks as a way to progress forward as opposed to um floundering in Notions about the the past and I think it it might it might hit some people Square upside the head when when there's I think one of the chapters opens with the words there's no such thing as trauma which is clearly not true but the whole idea is to to prompt a different way of thinking and to let people start to drill into like okay what do I need to do now regardless of what my parents did or didn't do right regardless of my damaged self and I I must say I really like the book well I would say I should say I I really like I should say I really like the concept embracing task while agonizing over the meaning of life and what one is to do yes well Adler was the most practical of the small crowd that aggregated around Freud and so yung's take was that Freud focused on sex and Adler focused on Power and Yung focused on what transcended both and I think that's right now Adler is a good repost to Freud in exactly the way you described if you like that book and you're interested in all three of them let's say there's a great book called discovery of the unconscious which was written by a man named hre elenberger who was the foremost exponent of existential psychology in the 1950s brilliant brilliant scholar and it is the best analysis of Freud Jung and Adler that's ever been written by a lot and it's it's a truly great book he also traces the idea of the unconscious back 350 years before Freud so it's a masterful study but I liked Adler and he was much less charismatic than Freud and Yung and so his star didn't shine as brightly but he's very practically oriented and much of his thinking would what would you say fits quite nicely with a bottom with the same kind of bottom up approach that a more behaviorally oriented psychotherapist would employ so look it's it's it's there are some people if you're if you're engaging in a therapeutic process with someone there are people who are best engaged with at the level of concept those are people are high in trait openness not everyone's like that in fact most people aren't like that yungi and psychology works really well on highly creative people and almost all yung's clients were creative because they wouldn't have come to him otherwise and there's also people for whom sexual dysfunction and Trauma are the primary what would you say say the the primary preoccupation of their life and the past and Freud serves them well Adler is very practical and if you're looking for a psychologist to help you figure out how you could advance from where you are now he's he's he's got plenty of things to say that are good he also wasn't as good a literary stylist as young Yung or Freud so that also put him off to the side to some degree but anyways a deep deeper investigations can certainly be found in discovery of the unconscious and if for anybody listening and watching who's interested in psychological ideas broadly and would like familiarity with the psychoanalytic tradition Freud Jung and Adler let's say primary there is not a better book than discovery of the unconscious it's really a work of Genius you know what's missing from the literature thank you for those by the way is a really excellent up-to-date book on neuroscience and the mind and psychology perhaps we write one together yeah yeah well that's that's me it's just not out there I mean there textbooks on Neuroscience there's some there's a lot of discussion as you know about Free Will lack of Free Will depending on which author you're paying attention to but um there isn't really a satisfactory book about the brain the mind and psychology this just doesn't exist yeah the closest one I ever encountered probably is affective Neuroscience panp book he's uh I'm So I must say um you've mentioned pup a few times and and Yak Pang uh as some of you may know but perhaps most of you don't is was such a gift to science and the fact that I think the first time I heard you lecture in one of your YouTube lectures you mentioned Yak Pang up and I thought okay like this guy knows knows the good stuff because he was the first one to talk about juvenile play as a way of exploring circuitry and social dynamics such such and that fit by the way that fit perfectly with PJ's observations of childhood socialization it's like I I came across panks up and I thought oh that's so cool now we have the psychophysiological basis for pan developmental theory was perfect yeah so that was that was lovely concordance YP would have been uh far more recognized had he bit he was at Bowling Green University I think and so smaller University perhaps I don't know I didn't ever hear a lecture maybe not as charismatic as some of the other luminaries of of neuroscience at that time but yeah I don't know how he was as a lecturer he's a great writer and man he had an uniring eye for the right problems in in terms of psychological investigation and very brave in that regard I mean he studied laughter in rats and you think oh of all the absurd things to focus on it's like no you just don't understand where the goal is or play among rats who cares that rats play well like that would be the sort of research proposal that would be pillared by sensible Republicans looking to trim government waste it's like no that was the heart of the matter right rats organized their social hierarchy through play not through Force right that's a big Discovery like that's I think he should have won a Nobel Prize you too yeah he he should have won a nail for a variety of his discoveries but that one in particular like rats have an implicit morality that's a that's a major league disc and it's based on play WoW stunning and we see the same thing in kids obviously and then well we see the same thing in chimpanzees like it's pretty strange to understand that dominance hierarchies if they're functional are often organized in consequence of play not force like so much for uh Fuko when you look on out on the landscape of social media um do you see elements of that as well that there's sort of a playfulness among uh people that's establishing a hierarchy it seems like elon's having a good time with his rockets and his X and Tesla and I think I think that there is I think that the antithesis of of tyranny is play it took me a long time to realize that like I've been studying evil intensely since I was about 13 and evil is easier to Define than good it's it's it's hard to find a category that integrates all that's good that's that you can point to Simply but it has the fact that play is the antithesis of tyranny seems to be a pretty good summation like pep showed for example that play wouldn't emerge among animals if they were possessed by any other motivational state things have to be set up very carefully before play will emerge your house is optimally structured if your children can play your marriage is optimally structured if you're playing house with your wife and I think that that reality of the what would you say the optimally superordinate nature of play that makes itself manifest when you're watching someone who's a master at their task and musk is playing and hopefully that will you know and Trump plays too it's one of the things that made me less uncertain about him he's deadly funny now it's rough he plays rough no doubt about it but he's ridiculously he's got a ridiculously comic touch and that's not something that's generally characteristic of you know Psychopathic dictators Hitler wasn't known for his sense of humor let's talk about sense of humor if you don't mind um because um I think it's something that's sorely lacking in a lot of the uh discourse among adults um so to speak and I think these days I think a lot about what young people are observing a few years back I I was watching this show I didn't like it um called forgive me because I think the actor was quite good um but the show was Californication with David dukovany and I realized this show is all about the adults acting like children and the children acting like adults oh yeah that's that's a typical Hollywood inversion and I thought um this is terrible um not because I'm some sort of moral Avenger or something but it just it was sort of like the question I've been asking myself a lot over the last few years is like who are the adults in the room like who's actually regulating all this stuff that's happening everyone's in disagreement people are are misbehaving in the kind of worst of ways um by you know not treating each other with respect um occasionally you'd see a discourse that would felt like meaningful and structured or um explorative in the real sense like people were there to learn I think that's been one of the successes of of your work and of Rogan's work and I like to think you know my podcast as well Lex fredman certainly and others right um sometimes people use comedy sometimes people use Neuroscience as as a as a probe but in any case but you know I've been concerned that there there isn't this kind of like enjoyment of discourse between people that disagree in a way that includes forgiveness or like ah you got like good one like you got me or you know and and um it seems like it it's degenerated into things that are so nasty and it's sort of like people are entering the game if you could even call it that with a refusal to shift like like that's not a debate that's there's nothing playful about it like you have to be willing to have a winner and a loser and you have to be willing to be either one if you're going to engage in real in in real discourse in real play and to me um it it's like okay I can manage seeing all that or participate or not participate to the extent that I want but for young people it's got to be really discouraging it's like you either dunk on somebody or get dunked on well you know I guess the optimistic repost to that would be the fact that the people that you're pointing to like Rogan who is a comedian like many of the people who've become become extremely successful as podcasters Constantine kissen Russell Brand Dave Rubin um Crowder Steven Crowder pH vaugh that's a lot of comedians so there's a lot of play in the alternative media and a lot of young people are being informed by the alternative media so I think there's genuine room for optimism there um and there's plenty of play in those podcasts now a group of us eight years ago seven years ago put out an offer to the Democratic powers that be to invite the Democrats to come and talk to us Ruben was part of that Rogan was part of that if I remember correctly I'm quite certain of it I was part of that Shapiro was part of that this was a genuine invitation which was extended many times in serious Ways by people who are very well connected among the Democratic Elite and that came to nothing they want no part of it nope they'd speak to me for example privately never publicly virtually never almost without exception all the while the alternative media was gaining more and more power all the while we were telling them this isn't optional your Legacy Media foothold is dying wake up well Rogan for example you can could imagine that he would be on board with such a thing because he's not precisely your stereotypical Republican no well no not at all right people will people will call him that they try and you know manosphere bro whatever that it doesn't it the reality Falls so far from when you not true at all it's not true yeah so so there is plenty of play and and I so I think we can be positive about that and and I think young people too have seen how successful that could be I mean Rogan and his codery let's say wiped out the Legacy Media well so you can see what the spirit of playful Adventure can do in a very short period of time now there's technological reasons for that too but technological reasons are not it's still a stunning phenomenon and a stunning accomplishment and a very positive one as far as I'm concerned and hopefully it will continue yeah the power pendulum has definitely swung in a different direction well that became Stark starkly obvious when Rogan interviewed Trump that was the death nail of the Legacy Media it certainly elevated podcasts and their their impact and significance across the board well I think it demonstrated the fact that they had been elevated right it was just it was it was evidence of that was that was so conclusive that there was no longer any way of qu of of questioning it even the CNN pundits and so forth who were very resistant to that as a hypothesis changed their tune very rapidly well it was interesting because Rogan's conversation with Trump was a serious one Theo's conversation with Trump was a mixture of serious and less serious and um I mean I couldn't help but smile big when um at the inauguration the thanks went out to a number of people including Theo vau I mean if you think about this you think good for Theo so fun I'm yet to meet him I I hear he's I really like Theo is so great because Theo is like he's he's Backwoods hick to the core right seriously underclass background and it's real and he's so bloody smart and so it's such a fun combination because he's got this it's pretty easy if you're elitist to you know be be what derisive about the in his back woodsy stick but man there's a sec there's a First Rate mind lurking behind that that it's not a Persona because it's actually him too you know I can relate to that to a large degree because you know I came from a very small town way the hell out in the middle of nowhere and so I have plenty in common with Theo but it's it's very funny to watch it's very funny to see him do this successfully it's ridiculously and preposterously comical that he got to sit down with Trump I mean I just thought that was that's so funny and that it was successful and playful you know that's great and there's plenty of play in the Republican Renaissance at the moment whatever that is I mean it's Republican to call it that is like that's whatever the hell's happening it's not conceptualized in terms of our normal political dichotomy right I mean we're in Uncharted water now hopefully this is why I hope the Democrats get their act together cuz every Administration needs an opposition and if the Democrats continue with this woke idiocy they're not going to be able to serve as the proper corrective to the excesses that will definitely emerge in the Trump Administration especially if they face no credible opposition always happens sorry I didn't mean to didn't mean to interrupt before we started we were touching on this a little bit and you said something which was that you're hoping for a really formidable strong Democratic party to counter the Republican party and you are and you're saying it again now you're concerned that if there isn't one that power corrupts might run a muck oh yes well of course it will it always does you know and that the Republicans themselves who might wish well this remarkable group of people that's aggregated around Trumpets like they should hope for themselves that they have an effective opposition because someone's got to be telling you where you're stupid and if the Democrats so this is another public invitation to the Democrats which is like must be the 50th one that I've issued if you have something to say you know I'd be happy to talk and so would many people who've expressed similar sentiment to me in the alternative media world and that offer has been on the table for for years so I hope that I'm afraid that all the people with any real courage or virtually all them be chased out of the democratic party they're all afraid of being cancelled which is why they wouldn't appear on my podcast to begin with it's like why does Peterson always interview conservatives it's like well how come how about because they'll talk to me you know there's a simple explanation and definitely a true one so maybe that can shift and there's got to be somebody in the Democrats who's got enough courage to forge a new Direction and if they want to continue with this same old pattern of woke idiocy well go right ahead it's not going to work the Tide's already turned in that regard I think that judging from some of the um article titles that I've um seen at uh New York Times and other venues it seems like there might be some consideration about this they're talking about a restructuring of the democratic party there who's going to lead who's going to be their uh Joe Rogan which is by the way a silly question that's just the silliest question we say in science he's n of one don't don't even try like it's the whole point is to create why would you would can't yeah right Joe didn't emerge by accident Joe is very very very smart very and if you think and like it's what it's like Joe built this it's like not the way that a political party would build it first of all he didn't build it not not not that way not through a prior planning so that the Democrats could have a voice it's just him being him yes exactly yeah and someone someone who is a self-declared Democrat will do that as well but not by trying to be him that's just not going to happen no they'll be they'll they'll do that by trying to figure out what the opposition to this new peculiar band of Republicans should be and what sort of vision could be put forward that would be attractive you know I read today some democrat claiming that the Democrats are the true voice of the working class it's like I don't think so I think that ship is sailed and maybe the Democrats should be the true voice of the working class but they're certainly not and in principle that would mean that there's an opportunity there on the Democrat side to forge A New Path mean Clinton managed that in the 90s this this has happened many times it could happen again but there's a lot of learning that's going to have to take place before that happens so certainly learning about this new alternative media environment if you can't sit down for three hours and say what you actually think actually what you think right regardless of what might do to your reputation let's say you're not going to be successful in the podcast world that's absolutely true right podcasting is real I even for I'll just say because perhaps it's of Interest or maybe even actionable for people I mean I I get a little frightened every podcast certainly if I'm going to talk about like I'm forming this relationship to or I'm exploring a I mean I'll talk about circuits in the brain all day long with with uh with no fear whatsoever that's my wheelhouse but anything that's new uh which is a a real exploration and evolution of of where I'm at um of course is going to evoke fear I also know that's where the growth is I would hate for this podcast to look the way it did on episode one now and um clearly this this conversation is a is a new direction that I've not taken before in this podcast and um but I'm delighted that it's happening want to say that and I think that some level of fear and anxiety about the unknown is is absolutely required and I think that that's something that hopefully any especially young people listening need to know you you're not supposed to perform well at the outset like in anything you're not can't that's why Yung said the fool is the precursor to the Redeemer you have to accept the role of fool voluntarily before you can improve improve of course when you start something new you're going to be an idiot like what do you know so so that's the price of Entry is to be a fool well you can be a voluntary fool and then you can then you have a bit of a sense of humor about yourself and that takes the sting out of it and maybe even makes you an attractive character despite your ignorance people will people will make tremendous allowances for ignorance that's voluntarily admitted to I've certainly made mistakes publicly apologize for the ones that I felt I should apologize for there's a slip of the tongue and make it said something went back and correct it was embarrassing but um the ability to laugh at oneself is is tremendously powerful genuinely laugh like just thinking like oh God where was I thing I understand this I you know sometimes we we air you know I have a couple of questions about you oh oh um I know you're the you're the clinician but uh and I'm not trying to play that role when you wake up in the morning is your mind in a good place typ Al or are you tormented or you where does your where does your mind land most mornings first thing well I've I've suffered from a proclivity towards depression my whole life I would say and I would say the roughest part of the day for me is morning although it's way better than it once was um so when I get up I have a shower and make my bed and do something useful and then I'm pretty much I'm on my way you're into your tasks into the day MH and I I still have quite a lot of pain from whatever happened to me a couple of years ago and so that's annoying physical pain yeah yeah yeah so but psychologically my life is ridiculously it's absurdly interesting it's crazily and absurdly interesting all the time and so anyone with any sense would be like open mouthed in amazement and gratitude for that it's Preposterous and I have this tour that's going well it's been going for like six years really and your tour schedule is is super human I have to say having done some live shows I mean what you do with tours and I've been to one of your shows I highly recommend people attend it was spectacular I I don't want to give too much away but it's not planned in the in the sense that there's a script or something it's very open and and but a real it's a quest an intellectual Quest right it's a real experience and men wear your jacket and tie because everyone else there going be wearing at least a jack up look look look respectable so my wife and I are touring from January through June and much of that's in the United States and then two months in Europe and so that's great because Europe is in trouble and going there to speak is a privilege and an honor and so that's ridic ridiculously exciting and people can find more out about the tour at jordanbpeterson.com the dates and so forth are all listed there um we launched Peterson Academy we where we want you to teach and that's going spectacularly well we had a place where people can hear lectures in a given domain yep yep yep we have 35 lectures online already each of them is sequenced over 6 to8 hours um which compacts I would say the equivalent of a full University course into that span of time we're pursuing accreditation which I think is a high probability in the relatively not too distant future so that's ridiculously exciting because we can take the best lectures in the world and we can make them available to everyone and we built a social media element into it we took the best of the social media networks and people are using it like mad and it's 100% positive it's philosophically oriented it's mutually encouraging we threw four people off the platform out of 40,000 well three cuz we put one guy on probation cuz he said he'd improve and we established a positive culture there's no Bots there's no trolls no one's playing games and we watch and now you know the community has settled into a it's got an ethos already and I think that'll be self- sustaining so people are there to learn and to support each other learning got it it it launched out of the gate better than we thought it would even though we were optimistic and I would say the quality of what we're offering exceeded it certainly exceeded my expectations it's well we we showed Michael malice Michael malice did a course for us on totalitarianism and he takes that rather personally given his family background and he said that the trailer brought him to tears and that's my now I can be easily brought to tear so I don't know if I'm the best like around certain topics I've cried a times on this podcast this year and a few others so that was that was a uh a vulnerability I'd never expected but yeah well it's good to know I'm not alone in that not alone I'm less susceptible now that I'm more healthy but but I feel the same way about what we're producing because it's exactly if you were a professor and you wanted the best possible courses to be available to people and you saw these you'd think target hit and and that's ridiculously fun and so and I have a great relationship with my wife and my kids and you have some grandkids now too I do and two more on the way W congratulations you know with and I have an endless field of Stellar opportunity in front of me so hopefully I have enough sense to appreciate that and hope and I do I do appreciate it and I know it's unlikely so a long way from posting lectures on YouTube which is where uh most people originally found you if they wereing about that that's certainly how I learned about you I thought this guy's talking about really interesting things in the fields of psychology he knows who Yak PP is and um and he's posting on YouTube can I ask what inspired that move was that from well conscious was that calling or conscience or both um it was probably mostly calling because the fundamental motivation was and I think it is my fundamental motivation is curiosity you know I watched YouTube and I thought H what the hell is this video on demand worldwide what does that mean it means the spoken word is now as permanent as the written word and more easily disseminated I thought oh that's a spectacular and World altering Revolution that's what it looks like to me this was like in 2010 you know when it was mostly cat videos I thought might as well put my videos up there and see what happens and so see what happens right that's an adventure and so I did that [Music] for maybe maybe seven years somewhere between five and seven years before things exploded around me and that was also extremely helpful because when I opposed the Trudeau government's attempt to compel my speech in the form of Bill c16 I was immediately pillared as a you know right-wing Nazi even though I'd spent my whole career publicizing the horrors of the Nazi Administration and teaching my students how not to fall prey to totalitarian Temptation like that was the core of my career um I had like 200 hours of lectures up on you already so when all that negative attention was drawn to me people started looking at the lectures and the huge Advantage there was that there wasn't a single really there wasn't a single important word I'd said to students in the last 20 years that wasn't recorded and the people who decided that you know I was a reprehensible character had every opportunity to go through everything I'd said with a fine- tooth comb which you can be absolutely certain they did and they couldn't find one thing I ever said that led any Ence whatsoever to their accusations and so that was a Breaking Point in some ways for cancel culture because there were very forceful attempts to counsel me and so people went and checked me out and they thought huh nothing he says falls into alignment with what he's being accused about well you know that what would you say that was part of the dam breaking with regards to the corruption of the Legacy Media So Not only was what I was accused of a lie it was exactly the opposite of the truth which is the most profound kind of lie so YouTube helped me out a lot there you've certainly prevailed and uh we're all so far well I guess that that speaks to what I was going to say which is that um I want to thank you for posting those videos on YouTube and for entering that Adventure because it certainly was the beginning of a long adventure that's still happening now where you continue to take risks that are healthy risks in service to trying to understand the truth and share that and I must say never with the the stance that you know absolutely right for everybody but certainly where you have felt you could share useful knowledge at the Practical level like really how to operationalize like clean up your room right you know um do these things to try and discover your path get on your path set your sights to the right level um and to make that a daily practice and a and a repeated lifelong practice is really spectacular and it's obviously inspired millions of people including myself I'll also say that it's really wonderful that you are also continuing to do that that yourself and making that visible to people your Live Events of course are an exploration in the moment where you raise a question and ask a question and address it it's not pre-planned and I must say that your progression of books and podcasts and where things are going now in particular that today you said you are hopeful that the Democratic party I think most people assume that you're very right leaning I'm not going to assume one way or the other but the fact that you are intentionally inviting and hoping for opposition so that power is checked and things continue in the right direction I think that's really beautiful because what you're asking for is more balance as opposed to more skewing of knowledge and power and I think um that's a terrific example and it's clear that you live right near the edge uh in order to inspire us to basically explore knowledge explore ancient teachings and merge them with where we are now yeah it's been unbelievably rewarding I mean part of the reason that my wife and I keep touring is because we meet all these people and they put their lives together it's thousands and thousands of people it's so gratifying you know wherever we go the probability that someone will come up and say thank you but then when I ask like for what what do you mean exactly what changed they tell me and there isn't anything better that can happen to you than to travel around the world and have perfect strangers come up to you as friends and tell you that their lives are far better than they would have been because of their efforts and because of their encounter with what you've been doing like if you could pray for anything to happen to you there's not a possibility that you could come up with a better wish than that and so it's great it's great and and it's fascinating to explore its continuation and to observe the consequences and it's a privilege to be in that it's an immense what would you say it's unspeakably immense privilege to be in that position and it's so great to see people like you and fredman and Chris Williamson and all these other podcasters who are pursuing the same vision and so successfully and to see the massive effect that's having on people that's such a good deal so and I do believe it's the sort of thing that's in a deeply personalized way available to anyone who follows their calling and conscience well thank you for those words I I also agree it's freely available by people being themselves and as you said following their curiosity and conscience thank you for coming here here today and sharing with us where you're at now your knowledge and please come back again I really enjoyed this hey anytime I appreciate the invitation very much and uh it's a pleasure watching your progress forward and seeing you propagate all the remarkable discoveries that have been made in in the field of Neuroscience because it's quite the credible Enterprise and people need to know the biology of motivation let's say and the biology of emotion and and uh it's great to see you managing that in a sophisticated way with so many people it's a good deal for everybody thank you it's a labor of love ins inspired in no small part by you and my other podcast colleagues and in your case my academic colleague so thank you Jordan

Title: Why Studying Without Your Phone Improves Focus
Published: 2024-12-28 18:03:00 UTC
Description:
Laurie Santos, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University, shares insights on why keeping your phone away can boost focus and performance.

Transcript Language: English
One of the biggest pieces of advice I give my college students is to study without your phone near you. Because Princeton studies have looked at this, whether you have somebody do say a math test or a studying test with your phone there versus a phone in the other room and you see like double digit increases in performance just to have your phone away. And you might ask like, "Well, why would that be?" It's like, well, part of your frontal lobe's like, Like, no, no, no. Don't look at the phone. Don't look at the phone. Don't look at that big wheelbarrow of delicious, interesting stuff. Stay on task." And that's this kind of constant moment of multitasking where we're kind of yanking our brain back onto task. And so a big hack, if you want to be more present, is to find ways to do activities without your phone. I guess if we go back to that fun question, if I said, you know, those three times you're having the most fun, you weren't in the middle of it pulling out your phone to like, look at your Instagram feed. You were just there.

Title: How to Learn Faster by Using Failures, Movement & Balance | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2024-12-26 13:00:58 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how making mistakes and perceived frustration drive learning and how movement enhances the brain’s adaptability. 

I explain how making errors triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, which are essential for learning. I also discuss the differences between how neuroplasticity occurs in children and adults, focusing on the varying requirements and effort needed for learning. I discuss science-supported learning strategies for adults, including small practice bouts, leveraging frustration, regulating your autonomic state, and using movement to maximize focus and neuroplasticity. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

welcome to hubman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance my name is Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we're going to talk about how to change your nervous system for the better as you recall your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord but also all the connections that your brain and spinal cord make with the organs of your body and all the connections that the organs of your body make with your brain and spinal cord now this thing that we call the nervous system is responsible for everything we know all our behavior all our emotions everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world everything we think and believe it's really at the center of our entire experience of life and who we are fortunately in humans unlike in other species we can change our nervous system by taking some very specific and deliberate actions and today we're really going to focus on the actions the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance that allow us to change our nervous system it turns out that movement and balance actually provide windows or portals into our ability to change our nervous system the way we want even if those changes are not about learning new movements or learning how to balance and soon you'll understand why so so let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity that are available to us because those will Point directly towards the type of protocols that we should engage in to change ourselves for the better there is something called representational plasticity representational plasticity is just your internal representation of the outside world we know that for instance if I want to reach out and grab the pen in front of me that I need to generate a certain amount of force so I rarely overshoot I rarely miss the pen okay so our maps of the Motor World and our maps of the sensory world are merged the way to create plasticity is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things and this I think is an amazing and important feature of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated the way to create plasticity is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong something is different and something isn't being Achi achieved errors and making errors out of sync with what we would like to do is how our nervous system is cued through very distinct biological mechanisms that something isn't going right and therefore certain neurochemicals are deployed that'll signal the neural circuits that they have to change so let's talk about errors and making errors and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals that then allow us to not just learn the thing that we're doing in the motor sense play the piano Dance Etc but it also creates an environment a millu within the brain that allows us to then go learn how to couple or uncouple a particular emotion to an experience or better language learning or better mathematical learning last episode we discussed some of the basic principles of neuroplasticity if you didn't hear that episode no problem I'll just review it quickly which is that it's a falsehood that everything that we do and experience changes our brain the brain changes when certain neurochemicals namely acetylcholine epinephrine and dopamine are released in ways and in the specific times that allow for neural circuits to be marked for change and then the change occurs later during sleep basically you need a certain cocktail of chemicals released in the brain in order for a particular Behavior to reshape the way that our brain works so the question really is what allows those neurochemicals to be released and last episode it talked all about Focus if you haven't uh seen or heard that episode you might want to check it out about some specific tools and practices that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus and release certain chemicals in that cocktail but today we're going to talk about the other chemicals in the cocktail in particular dopamine and we're really going to Center our discussion around this issue of making errors and why making errors is actually the signal that tells the brain okay it's time to change or more generally it's time to pay attention to things so that you change and I really want to distinguish this uh Point really clearly which is that I'm going to talk today a lot about motor and vestibular meaning balance programs but not just for learning motor commands and and balance but also for setting a stage or a kind of condition in your brain where you can go learn other things as well so let's talk about some classic experiments that really nail down what's most important in this discussion about plasticity as I mentioned last episode and I'll just tell you right now again the brain is incredibly plastic from about birth until about age 25 and then somewhere about 25 it's not like the day after your 26th birthday plasticity closes there's a kind tapering off of plasticity and you need different mechanisms to engage plasticity as an adult knowing how to tap into these plasticity mechanisms is very powerful the simplist examples if I hear something off to my right I look to my right if I hear it on the left I look to my left if I hear it right in front of me I keep looking right in front of me and that's because our maps of visual space and our maps of auditory space and our maps of motor space are aligned to one another in perfect register it's an incredible feature of our nervous system it takes place in a structure called The Superior calculus although you don't need to know that name Superior calculus has layers literally stacks of neurons like in a sandwich where the zero point right in front of me or maybe you know 10 or 15 degrees off to my right or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left are aligned so that the the auditory neurons the ones that care about sounds at 15° to my right sit directly below the neurons that look at 15 Dees to my right in my visual system and when I reach over to this direction there's a signal that's that sent down through those layers that says 15° off to the right is the direction to look it's the direction to listen and it's the direction to move if I need to move so there's an alignment and this is really powerful and this is what allows us to move through space and function in our lives in a really fluid way it's set up during development but there have been some important experiments that have revealed that the these maps are plastic meaning they can shift they're subject to neuroplasticity and there are spe specific rules that allow us to shift them so here's the key experiment the key experiment was done by a colleague of mine who's now retired but whose work is absolutely fundamental in the field of neuroplasticity Eric nudson the nudson lab and many of the newon lab scientific Offspring showed that if one is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual field that eventually there'll be a shift in the representation of the auditorium motor Maps too now what they initially did is they looked at Young subjects and what they did is they moved the visual World by making them wear prism glasses so that for instance if a if my pen is out in front of me at you know 5 degrees off center so just a little bit off center if you're listening to this this would be like just a little bit to my right but in these prism glasses I actually see that pen way over far on my right so it's actually here but I see it over there because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes what happens is in the first day or so you ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever to reach for this object and they reach to the wrong place because they're seeing it where it isn't but what you find is that in young individuals within a day or two they start adjusting their motor behavior in exactly the right way so that they always reach to the correct location so that hear a sound at one location they see the object that ought to make that sound at at a different location and they somehow are able to adjust their motor Behavior to reach to the correct location it's incredible and what it tells us is that these maps that are aligned to one another can move and shift and it happens best in young individuals if you do this in older individuals in most cases it takes a very long time for the maps to shift and in some cases they never shift so this is a very experimental scenario but it's an important one to understand because it really tamps down the fact that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts in our representation of the outside world so how can we get plasticity as adults that mimics the plasticity that we get when we are juveniles well the nudson lab and other labs have looked at this and it's really interesting the signal that generates the plasticity is the making of errors it's the reaches and failures that signal to these to the nervous system that this is not working and therefore the shifts start to take place and this is so fundamentally important because I think most people understandably get frustrated like they're trying to learn a piece on the pianoo and they don't know how they can't do it or they're trying to write a piece of code or they're trying to access some sort of motor behavior and they can't do it and the frustration drives them crazy and like I can't do it I can't do it when they don't realize that the the errors themselves are signaling to the brain and nervous system something's not working and of course the brain doesn't understand the words something isn't working the brain doesn't even understand frustration as an emotional state the brain understands the neurochemicals that are released namely epinephrine and acetylcholine but also and we'll get into this the molecule dopamine when we start to to approximate the correct Behavior just a little bit and we start getting it a little bit right so what happens is when we make errors the nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters and neurom modulators that say we better change something in the circuitry and so errors are the basis for neuroplasticity and for Learning and I wish that this was um more prominent prominent out there I guess this is why I'm saying it um and humans do not like this feeling of frustration and and making errors the few that do do exceedingly well in whatever Pursuits they happen to be involved in the ones that don't generally don't do well they generally don't learn much and if you think about it why would your nervous system ever change why would it ever change unless there was something to be afraid of something that made us feel awful will signal that the nervous system needs to change or there's an error in our performance so it turns out that the feedback of these errors the reaching to the wrong location starts to release a number of things and now you've heard about them many times but this would be epinephrine it increases alertness acetycholine Focus because if aceto Coline is released it creates an opportunity to focus on the the error margin the distance between what it is that you're doing and what it is that you would like to do and then the nervous system starts to make changes almost immediately in order to try and get the behavior right and when you start getting it even a little bit right that third molecule comes online or is is released which is dopamine which allows the plastic changes to occur very fast now this is what all happens very naturally in young brains but in Old brains it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions so let me just pause and just say this if you are uncomfortable making errors and you get frustrated easy easily if you leverage that frustration toward drilling deeper into the Endeavor you are setting yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage but if you take that frustration and you walk away from the Endeavor you are essentially setting up plasticity to rewire you according to what happens afterwards which is generally feeling pretty miserable so now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is that continuing to drill into a process to the point of frustration but then staying with that process for a little bit longer and I'll Define exactly what I mean by a little bit is the the most important thing for adult learning as well as childhood learning but adult learning in particular now the Newton lab did two very important sets of experiments the first one which showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts in their map representations they get a lot of plasticity all at once it happens very fast in a period of just a couple days in adults it tends to be very slow and most individuals never actually accomplish the full map shift they don't get the plasticity then what they did is they started making the increment of change smaller so instead of Shifting the the world a huge amount by putting prisms that shifted the the visual world you know all the way over to the right they did this incrementally so first they put on prisms that shifted it just a little bit you know just like 7° I believe was the exact number and then it was 14° and then it was 28° and so what they found was that the adult nervous system can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time but that you can stack those errors so that you can get a lot of plasticity put simply incremental learning as an adult is absolutely essential you are not going to get massive shifts in your representations of the outside world so how do you make small errors as opposed to Big errors well the key is smaller bouts of focused learning for smaller bits of information it it's a mistake to try and learn a lot of information in one learning bout as an adult now there is one way to get a lot of plasticity all at once as an adult there is that kind of Holy Grail thing of you know getting massive plasticity as you would when you were a a young person but as an adult and the nudson lab revealed this by setting a very serious contingency on the the learning what they did was they had a situation where subjects had to find food that was displaced in their visual world again by putting prisms and they had to find the food and the food made a noise there was a noise set kind of the location of the food through an array of speakers basically in order to eat at all they needed plasticity and then what happened was remarkable what they observed is that the plasticity as an adult can be as atic as robust as it is in a young person or in a young animal subject provided that there's a serious incentive for the plasticity to occur and this is absolutely important to understand which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity determines how fast that PL plasticity will arrive this means that the importance of something how important something is to us actually Gates the rate of plasticity and the magnitude of plasticity and this is why just passively going through most things going through the motions as we say or just getting our reps in quote unquote is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change if we actually have to accomplish something in order to eat or in order to get our ration of of income we will reshape our nervous system very very quickly and so I think that the studies that nudson did showing that incremental learning can can create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult as well as when the contingency is very high meaning we need to eat or we need to make an income or we need to do something that's vitally important for us that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps just like they can in adolescence and young adulthood that points to the fact that it has to be a neurochemical system there has to be an underlying mechanism all the chemicals that we're about to talk about are released from drug stores if you will chemical stores that already reside in all of our brains and the key is how to tap into those stores and so we're going to next talk about what are the specific behaviors that liberate particular categories of chemicals that allow us to make the most of incremental learning and that set the stage for plasticity that is similar enough or mimics these high contingency States like the need to get food or really create a sense of internal urgency chemical urgency if you will if you've heard previous episodes of this podcast you may have heard me talk about ultradian rhythms which are these 90-minute rhythms that break up our 24-hour day uh they help break up our sleep into different cycles of sleep like REM sleep and non-rem sleep and in waking States they help us um or I should say they U break up our day in ways that allow us to learn best within 90minut Cycles Etc today we're really talking about how to tap into plasticity um through the completion of a task or or working towards something repetitively and making errors the ultradian cycle says that for the first 5 to 10 minutes of doing that your mind is going to drift and your focus will probably kick in provided that you're visually uh you're restricting your visual world to the just the material in front of you something we talked about last episode somewhere around the 10 or 15 minute Mark and then at best you're probably going to get about an hour of of uh deliberate kind of tunnel vision uh learning in there your mind will drift and then toward the end of that what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20 minute um cycle you're going to your brain will start start to flicker in and out you're trying your best to accomplish something and you're failing you want to keep making errors for this period of time that I'm saying will last anywhere for about 7 to 30 minutes it is exceedingly frustrating but that frustration it liberates the chemical cues that signal that plasticity needs to happen and it is the case that when we come back a day or two later in a learning bout after a nap or a night or two of deep rest then what we find is that we can remember certain things and the motor pathways work and we don't always get it perfectly but we get a lot of it right whereas we got it wrong before so that 7 to 30 minute intense learning about specifically about making errors I want to really underscore that and it's not about uh as I mentioned before coming up with some little hack or trick or um or something of that sort it's really about trying to cue the nervous system that something needs to change because otherwise it simply won't change I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning by doing the following learn to attach dopamine in a subjective way to this process of making errors because that's really combining two modes of plasticity in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity in other words making failures repe failing repetitively provided we're engag in a very specific set of behaviors when we do it as well as telling ourselves that those failures are good for Learning and good for us creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity it it accelerates plasticity now some of you might be asking and I get asked a lot well how do I get dopamine to be released you can I just tell myself that something is good when it's bad well actually yes Believe It or Not dopamine is one of these incredible molecules that both can be released according to things that are hardwired in us to release dopamine again things like food sex warmth when we're cold cool environments when we're too warm it's that kind of pleasure molecule overall but it's also highly subjective what releases dopamine in one person versus the next so everyone releases dopamine in response to those very basic kind of behaviors and and activities but dopamine is also released according to what we subjectively believe is good for us and that's what's so powerful about it in fact a book that I highly recommend if you want to read more about dopamine is a book that frankly I wish I had written it's such a wonderful book it's called the molecule of more and it really talks about dopamine not just as a molecule associated with reward but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit and just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be so make lots of errors tell yourself that those errors are important and good for your overall learning goals so learn to attach dopamine meaning release dopamine in your brain when you start to make errors once you're attaching dopamine to this process of making errors then I start getting lots of questions that really are the the right questions which are you know how often should I do this and when should I be doing this and at what time well I've talked a little bit about this in previous episodes but as long as we're now kind of into the nitty gritty of tools and application each of us have some natural times throughout the day when we are going to be much better at tolerating these errors and much more focused on what it is that we're trying to do last episode was about Focus but chances are that you can't focus as well at 400 p.m. as you can at 10: a.m. it differs for everybody depending on when you're sleeping and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms but find the time or times of day when you naturally have the highest mental acuity and that's really when you want to engage in these learning bouts and then get to the point where you're making errors and then keep making errors for 7 to 30 minutes just keep making those errors and drill through it and you're almost seeking frustration and if you can find some pleasure and the frustration yes that is a state that exists you've created the optimal neurochemical milu for learning that thing but then here's the beauty of it you also created the optimal M for learning other things afterward at least for an hour or so I would say you're going to be in a state of heightened learning again these aren't gimmicks these tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity and the three that I'd like to talk about next are balance meaning the vestibular system as well as the two sides of what I call limic friction or autonomic arousal and if none of that makes sense I'm going to put a a fine point on each one of those and what is and why it works for opening up neuroplasticity let's talk about lyic friction lyic friction I realize is not something you're going to find in any of the textbooks but it is an important principle that captures a lot of information that is in textbooks both neurobiology and psychology and it has some really important implications limic friction is my attempt to give a name to something that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress because typically when we hear about stress we think of heart rate heartbeat going too fast breathing too fast sweating and not being in a state that we want we're too alert and we want to be more calm and indeed that's one condition in which we have lyic friction meaning our lyic system is taking control of a number of different aspects of our autonomic or auton automatic biology and we are struggling to control that through what we call top down mechanisms we're trying to calm down in order to reduce that level of arousal we're all familiar with this it's called the stress response however there's another aspect of stress that's just as important which is when we're tired and we're fatigued and we need to engage we need to be more alert than we are and so what I call limic friction is really designed to describe the fact that when our autonomic nervous system isn't where we want it meaning we're trying to be more alert or we're trying to be less alert both of those feel stressful to people but the reason I'm bringing this up is that in order to access neuroplasticity you need these components of focus you need the component of of S of attaching subjective reward you need to make errors all this stuff and a lot of people find it difficult to just get into the overall state to access those things here's the the beauty of it if you are too alert meaning you're too you know anxious and you want to calm down in order to learn better there are things that you can do the two that I've spoken about previously on various podcasts I'll just review them really quickly are the double inhale exhale so inhaling twice through the nose and exhaling once through the mouth this is what's called a physiological sigh offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs the other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision you know when you use tunnel vision you're very focused that epinephrine is released by dilating your your field of gaze so-called panoramic Vision but the other side of limic friction is important too if you you are too tired and you can't focus well then it's going to be impossible to even get to the starting line so to speak for engaging in neuroplasticity through incremental learning Etc so in that case there are other methods that you can do to wake yourself up the best thing you should do is get a good night sleep but that's not always possible or use a nsdr non-sleep deep rest protocol but if you've already done those things or you're simply exhausted for whatever other reason then there are other things that I often get asked about like sure a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing which means inhaling more than exhaling on average in a in a breathing bout now we're sort of getting toward the realm of like how you could trick your nervous system into waking up and if you bring more oxygen in by making your inhales deeper and longer you will become more alert you'll start to actually deploy norepinephrine if you breathe very fast so there are things that you can do to move up or down this so-called autonomic arousal Arc and what you want to ask before you undergo any learning bout is how much lyic friction am I experiencing am I too alert and I want to be calmer or am I too calm and too sleepy and I want to be more alert you're going to need to engage in behaviors that bring you to the starting line in order to learn there are other things that you can do in order to then learn better and faster besides incremental learning and those Center on the vestibular system why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity well we have a hardwired system for balance and here's how it works in as simple terms as I can possibly come up with as we move through space or even if we're stationary your brain doesn't really know where your body is except when through that propri acceptive feedback the main way it knows is through three planes of movement that we call pitch which is like nodding so if I nod like this that's pitch then there's yaw which is like shaking my head no and then there's roll from side to side like when a puppy looks at you like that kind of thing okay so pitch yaw and roll our ears have two main roles one is to hear right to perceive sound waves or take in sound waves for perception soall hearing and the other is balance or vestibular function so sitting in our ears are these semicircular canals and they're these little tubes where these little little Stones they're actually little bits of calcium roll back and forth like little marbles when we roll This Way they roll this way when we pitch when we go from side to side there's some that sit flat like this and they go like marbles inside of a hula hoop and then we have roll there's some that are kind of at 45 degrees to those and it's kind of pitch yaw and roll so okay great that sends signals to the rest of our brain and body that tell us how to compensate for shifts relative to gravity I say okay well I thought we were talking about plasticity but this is where it gets really really cool errors in vestibular motor sensory EXP experience meaning when we are off balance and we have to compensate by looking at thinking about or responding to the world differently cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum it actually means mini brain it looks like a little mini brain like tucked below our our cortex in the back cause the cerebellum to Signal some of these deeper brain centers that release dopamine norepinephrine and acetylcholine and that's because these circuits in the inner ear Etc and the cerebellum they were designed to re-calibrate our motor movements when our relationship to gravity changes something fundamental to survival we can't afford to be falling down all the time or missing things that we grab for or running in the wrong direction when something is pursuing us these are hardwired circuits that tap right into these chemical Pathways and those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity so I really want to spell this out clearly because I've given a lot of information today the first thing is how are you arriving to the learning bout you need to make sure your level of autonomic arousal is correct the ideal state is going to be clear Cal and focused maybe a little bit more on the on the arousal level like heightened arousal so understand lyic friction understand that you can be too tired in which case you're going to need to get yourself more alert or you can be to alert and you're going to need to get yourself calmer so the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal clear and focused is best but don't obsess over being right there it's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired then you want to make errors we talked about that and this vestibular motor sensory relationship is absolutely key if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity and we talked about another feature which is setting an a contingency if there's a reason an important reason for you to actually learn even if you're making failures the learning will be accelerated so there's really four things that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult and I would say that these also apply to young people and there's an interesting kind of thought experiment there as well which is if you look at children they are moving a lot in different dimensions whatever sport the kids are playing or even if they don't play a sport they tend to move in a lot of different relationships to gravity more dimensionality to their movements I should say than adult as we age we get less good at engaging in neuroplasticity part of that is because as we get older we tend to get more linear and more regular about specific kinds of movement so you sort of have to wonder whether or not the lack of plasticity or the reduced plasticity in older individuals which includes me would reflect the fact that those chemicals aren't being deployed because we're not engaging in certain behaviors as opposed to We Can't engage in the behaviors because the chemicals aren't being deployed so I want to make sure that I I underscore the fact that this vestibular thing that I've been describing is a way to really accentuate plasticity it's tapping into an inborn biological mechanism where the cerebellum has outputs to these deep brain nuclei associated with dopamine acetycholine and orpine phrine that's an kind of an amplifier on plasticity as is high contingency if you really need to learn conversational French to save your relationship chances are you're going to learn it now there are limits to this of course too if someone puts a gun to my head and says learn conversational French in the next 120 seconds um I think we would probably be my only response because I can't stuff in all the knowledge all at once I mean I think that's the dream of brain machine interface that one will be able to download a chip into their hippocampus or cortex or some other brain structure that would allow them to download conversational French and someday uh we may get to that and so my overall goal here in this episode and with this podcast is to give you some understanding of the mechanisms and the insights into the underlying biology that allow you to tailor what these kind of foundational mechanisms are to suit your particular learning needs so I very much thank you for your time and attention I know it's a lot of information and it takes a bit of focus and attention and certainly will trigger plasticity to learn all this information I want to encourage you and just remind you that you don't have to grasp it all at once that it is here archived and that if you want to return to the information it will still be here and that I most of all really appreciate your interest in science thank you so much [Music]

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Lori Santos Dr Lori Santos is a professor of cognitive science and psychology at Yale University she is a world expert in happiness and in the science of emotions generally today we talk about true happiness not in any kind of loose and aspirational way but instead what the research really tells us about how to create lasting happiness for ourselves we talk about relationships and happiness that is relationships of all kinds between friends between romantic Partners between family members and of course with ourselves we talk about all of that in the context of what to do what not to do and how to frame your whole notion of What happiness is and how to attain it in the context of daily Tod do for instance most all of us by now have heard about the power of gratitude and gratitude practices in fact I've done an entire episode about gratitude and the science of gratitude but Dr Lori Santos today explains that by shifting our orientation toward gratitude toward something more aligned with what Delights us we are able to better tap into the mechanisms that enable us to feel happier in a more pervasive way we also discuss topics such as hedonic adaptation that is how our pursuit of things and our whole experience experience of pleasure sets the stage for what's going to feel like a meaningful Pursuit and pleasureful in the days and weeks to follow this is very important for everyone to hear especially in this Modern Age of so-called dopamine hits easy to achieve dopamine highly processed foods and the various things that you can find online and speaking of online we also discuss the role that smartphones and social media play not just in our happiness but in our cognition you'll be shocked indeed I was shocked to learn that just having your phone in the room where you are trying to learn something significantly diminishes your performance on things like mathematics and the learning of other topics we get into all of that today the interrelated parts and I promise that it's all made extremely clear and actionable thanks to Dr Lori Santos's incredible expertise and she is an incredible teacher in fact the course that she has taught at Yale University entitled psychology and the good life is the most popular course ever taught at Yale over the course of 300 years and that popularity will not come as a surprise as you now get to learn from Dr lorri Santos directly this was a remarkable episode I must say I learned so much and I'll just highlight one big takeaway that I've implemented in my own life and that you can frame in the back of your mind as you listen to today's episode is the difference between being happy with one's life as opposed to in one's life and indeed how to achieve both before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night that's truly the foundation of all mental health physical health and performance and one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3 degrees eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight8 Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation of the PO cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and even has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eight- Sleep mattress cover go to 8sleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by expressvpn expressvpn is a virtual private Network that keeps your data secure and private it does that by routing your internet activity through their servers and encrypting it so that no one can see or sell your data now I'm familiar with the effects of not securing my data well enough several years ago I had one of my bank accounts hacked and it was a terrible amount of work to have that reversed and for the account to be secured when that happened I talked to my friends in the tech community and what they told me was that even though you think you're in interet connection may be secure often times it's not especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks such as those on planes in hotels at coffee shops and other public places surprisingly even at home your data might not be as secure as you think to make sure that what I described before would never happen to me again I started using expressvpn the great thing about expressvpn is that I don't even notice that it's running since the connection it provides is so fast I have it on my computer and on my phone and I keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet with expressvpn I know everything is secure my web browsing all my passwords all my data and of course anything that's behind an account wall like a bank account it can't be tracked and no one can access or steal your data which is terrific if you'd like to start protecting your internet activity using expressvpn you can go to expressvpn.com huberman and you can get an extra 3 months free again that's expressvpn.com slh huberman to get an extra 3 months free and now for my discussion with Dr Lori s Santos Dr Lori Santos welcome thanks so so much for having me on the show I want to talk about this thing that everyone seems to want but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of Happiness which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness but just to sit back from that question for a moment how should we think about the relationship between emotions and this thing that we call cognition because I think a lot of where we're going today is to distinguish between feelings thoughts and behaviors and as neuroscientists psychologists Etc we have to understand the difference between emotions and cognition and maybe where they overlap so if you could educate us a bit on that I think that will uh set the stage nicely for understanding happiness yeah well I'm glad you started there actually because you know the very definition of happiness I think as social scientists tend to think about it includes both of these parts right so I think social scientists tend to think about happiness as being happy in your life and being happy with your life so being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side right I have decent number of positive emotions maybe slightly less negative emotions like you existing in your life feels good that's kind of an emotional part right um but then there's also kind of how you think your life is going do you have purpose are you kind of happy with how things are going it's how you think about your life which is sort of a cognitive thing and so even the earliest social scientists who started thinking about happiness at the time they call it subjective wellbeing so I think psychologists were like happiness TS sounds too wooy like we'll call it something else but it means exactly the same thing it means subjective wellbeing right when they started thinking about subjective well-being they divided it into this sort of affective emotional part which is like how you feel in your life but also this cognitive part how you think your life is going so that basic dichotomy has been there since the very beginning of folks studying happiness scientifically I'm already struck by this distinction between how things are going in your life versus with your life um one requires a a kind of firstperson experiencing of life in your life you know do you wake up feeling good are you um feeling good with your inside of your friendships and other relationships family romantic relationships school work the other um involves a bit of a third personing of self yep of looking at one's um CV either actual CV or um reflected CV uh through the lens of other people and kind of getting a sense like am I doing well am I not doing well um I think this is a really important distinction um because it seems like ultimately the goal if I may is to be happy in your life regardless of the third personing provided that you're not doing damage to somebody else's happiness in life yeah well I think ideally it'd be nice to do both right and I think there are moments when these things dissociate right so you know you interact with lots of interesting rich people out here in California I think a lot of them have kind of in their life feels pretty good right they have lots of hedonic Pleasures they're drinking nice wine hanging out Beach you be amazed at how much how much I'm how much suffering they report oh that's interesting how much suffering they report so this is the question is is is this sort of cognitive part the like third person part or is it the reporting part and I think when the psychologists are thinking about it they really think about it as the reporting part right and and this gets tricky right because you know I see folks having their nice glass of wine on the beach and I'm thinking like that's coming with lots of positive emotion like I bet if I tested them and could have a direct look at their sensory experience and probably be pretty positive it's only when they reflect on their life and they're asking well how's it going that they say oh you know I don't know my stocks went down or like when I hear about um lack of Happiness let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones that seem to come up repetitively are they are indeed not related to lack of resources I don't hear that what I've heard and this is also true for where I spend part of my time in where I grew up which is in cicon Valley which is also not everyone but there are people there who have accured tremendous amount of wealth the mean has shifted very high at and hence the cost of living um but it's often concerns about um their kids yeah or their mother is ill their child is struggling in a particular way um very often that's what it is they're concerned about the lack of well-being in their kids Rel related to mental health or physical health or other relatives mental health physical health or they're upset about something politically yeah but we won't go there we won't go there yeah no I think this is true right you know so much of our happiness is made up of the happiness of other people right um both kind of how they're doing and how we think they're doing cognitively but literally just emotionally right you know if you've ever been around a family member or a spouse who was incredibly pissed off really sad it's it's incredibly hard not to catch those emotions yourself and we as psychologists know how these processes work right these process are emotional contagion where you're literally catching the emotions of other people and so oftentimes the things that you most worry about to be happy yourself is focusing on the happiness of the people around you because that literally becomes your happiness at a very fundamental level now I'm pausing just to think about this a little bit more as we grow up um and I realize it varies by place and lots of circumstances but as we grow up we are taught to pay attention to how our life is going a bit from the outside we yeah gain evaluations starting really young little stars on our pictures or good job or nowadays they say great effort in drawing this whole thing the growth mindset language um but I don't know that in the United States we are taught to um think about being happy in our life yeah right as as kids kids I think all kids all all mammals seem to gravitate towards um joyful experiences for them playing is almost always an innate um joyful experience but then as the evaluations start coming in we we get better and better at assessing our performance and where we are um relative to the sort of standard goals of the third grade the fifth grade the 12th grade um but at the same time I don't think anyone ever sat me down and said um how are you going to evaluate if you're feeling good in your life like that you're savoring your soccer game that you're savoring your time with friends that was never never taught to me yeah and I think there's a real danger of these kind of extrinsic rewards as you might call them all the stuff outside the grades you know the performance measures and so on literally stealing your intrinsic rewards um there's this funny phenomenon on psychology where if you have something that's intrinsically rewarding so let's say exercise right like I want to go out you know and like you to run like a bunch right I love running I get this intrinsic reward from running now I get some sort of tool whether it's my watch or something I'm scribbling down in a phone app and I have to like log my running now it becomes a sort of extrinsic reward it's not just like the feeling of running but it sort of takes on this extrinsic idea and then what happens is sometimes we end up going for that reward anyway um the fiction writer David sideras has this wonderful uh article called the Fitbit life where he talks about how he wanted to get fit it's in intrinsic reward of you know exercising more and he got the Fitbit and then it was all about the Fitbit he would set the level higher and set the level higher and he himself was miserable and no longer enjoying running to the point that like at some point he just would walk around you know shaking his arm just to get up to those final steps right that's a really terrible case where your extrinsic reward winds up taking over but so many of the cases you just talked about are ones in our real life where that comes up much more insidiously than like a Fitbit or something like that you talked about play in mammals the easiest thing that little kid animals do all over over the place little kid humans don't do that as much anymore because even from really young ages they're you know in toddler you know University where they're kind of learning things to get into the next grade and get the perfect grade so they can get into institutions like ours right it all becomes about extrinsic rewards and so I think you're really right we're kind of extrinsic sizing all the rewards to the point that we're not getting to internal happiness it was hard already to pay attention to that stuff because I think we'll probably talk about this it's hard to be mindful about your emotion you really have to pay attention to what's going on but I think it's gotten even harder because we have these metrics they're all over the place in our culture but they're just not the intrinsic thing there's some extrinsic marker that could make the intrinsic thing even less fun for people that um grow up or live in areas where well let's just say that that have less um disposable wealth um is there there must be data on sort of um relationship to Intrinsic versus extrinsic um forces on happiness I mean I can make up all sorts of stories in my head about how people starting out from very different circumstances would be more or less happy but what do the data say yeah so these effects of kind of resources on happiness are really interesting and they're nuanced right so if you look at the lower end of the kind of income Spectrum you would obviously say that money affects happiness right if you can't put food on the table if you can't put a roof over your head definitely getting a little bit more is going to affect your happiness in a positive way and the data sort of bear this out um this very there's a very famous study by the uh Nobel prize winning Economist Danny conoman rip um back in 2010 he did this cool study where he looked at the correlation between income and happiness as reported in how much stress you have um how much positive emotion you experience and so on at the low end of the income scales it just goes up and up and up right more money just almost linearly gives you more happiness but what Danny found and is the second part of this nuanced picture is that that slope kind of levels off and it levels off in $210 at around $75,000 what does that mean that means if you get more than $75,000 um you're not going to feel any less stressed you're not going to experience any more positive emotion even if I double or triple or quadruple your income on those metrics you're not going to see any increase then those are um pre-tax 2010 yeah they didn't get into like the real CU you're like oh my god well I live in California like if you live in Iowa maybe it's not so bad but like and those numbers will change but the upshot is there's probably some number in like 20 25 2024 numbers that might be like you know maybe $1,000 $120,000 whatever it is the point is that there's some number at which getting more is not going to increase your happiness at the same slope now there's been nuanced fights about this as there is a lot in kind of real research about well is that really true does the slope really ever go up and now the picture seems to be well the slope might go up a teeny tiny like negligible bit but it doesn't go up as as much as say getting extra 10 minutes of exercise in or another 20 minutes of sleep or scribbling the things you're grateful for all those things will impact your happiness much more than like quintupling your income and so do do your resources affect happiness yeah if you ain't got any resources you definitely will feel happier if you can get them but if you have a lot getting more really isn't going to help sorry to interrupt but lately I've been um saying on the basis of those findings about this than 75 yeah K per year probably now like you said 100 to 125k let's just say something like that um would be the equivalent amount uh that money indeed cannot buy happiness but it can buffer stress do you think that's true you're making me rethink that statement maybe it doesn't buffer stress past a certain amount yeah I mean I think in in the original e conoman data he found that it doesn't right I mean how much stress you report on a daily basis was literally one of the measures they were using for happiness but I think you're right it can the risk around it can buffer it right I think if you're at a certain set of means you know that like you know if a bad thing happens you're going to be okay so it can allow you to make riskier decisions that can allow you to do things that you might not do if you're right at that boundary where losing some money it might pop you back down I think the problem is that one of the ways we evaluate our financial situation but pretty much every situation I think this goes back to the nurse science is that we don't do it objectively we do it relative and when you think about your relative financial status there's lots of other folks around to whom you're comparing yourself I think one of the reasons that rich folks don't necessarily think they're less stressed when they have very high levels of wealth and so on is because they're looking around and everyone's doing much better than them like and this is just a fundamental feature of the way we evaluate stuff right is that we don't evaluate in objective terms we evaluate relative to these reference points and honestly as you get you're kind of going up this sort of logarithmic scale where their reference points are getting even further away from you and I think that that can have a huge hit on people's perception of their own happiness and their perception of their stress levels right because they're working towards a goal that's probably not going to make them that much happier but they haven't kind of abandon this intuition that more money will make me happy um on my podcast the happiness lab I had this guy Klay cockroll who is really fun he's a a a wealth psychologist so he's a mental health professional that only works with the 0.00001% and already we should say well if if wealth made you happy he should be out of a job but no he's lots of clients lots of I guess very well-paying clients he looked like he was doing well for himself um but he talks about how those folks haven't abandoned this notion that more money will make them happy they set some standard like oh as soon as I become as soon as I get 50 million I'll be happy or as soon as I become a billionaire but then they get to that point they're not feeling any more positive emotion they're not feeling less stressed and rather than saying well hang on maybe that hypothesis was wrong more money doesn't work they say ah the hypothesis it's all right more money will make me happy I just got a it wasn't 50 million now it's 100 million or whatever it is and so I think that that's a lot due to the fact that folks are comparing their wealth levels against others and our our comparison system sucks because we constantly compare ourselves against others but we never pick people that are doing worse than us we always pick people who are doing better than us I know a fair number of very happy wealthy people I know a fair number of very miserable wealthy people I know a fair number of um happy uh non-wealthy people and a fair number of miserable inside they report feeling miserable um un unwealthy people well it fits completely with what you know a lot of the happiness research suggests right which is that it's much less about our circumstances than we think when it comes to who's happy and who's not right you know we often think you know if I could get more money or if I could get more accolades at work or if I could get a new partner if I could move somewhere I'd be happier but exactly what you're saying if you look at people with all those different life circumstances both the good version and the bad version find some happy folks and some not so happy folks and now what researchers are starting to think is that it actually doesn't involve our circumstances as much as we think again I like with bracket it unless those circumstances are really dire circumstances don't matter as much as we think it tends to be the kind of stuff that's much more under our control than our circumstances right it tends to be how we behave what are what thought patterns we use the emotions we seek out the social connection we experience those things matter much more and so I think you know your experience with the happy and not so happy Rich folks and the happy and not so happy poor folks kind of bear out what we think it's like it's just not your circumstances that doesn't matter as much as you assume let's talk about this relationship between feelings thought patterns and behaviors in the context of happiness I think anyone listening to this or watching this probably wants to be happy as much as possible I mean I suppose there are few songwriters poets and I've got some friends in in uh in those uh domains of life and they do seem to derive a lot of um insight and inspiration and have done amazing things um through the kind of depths of uh unhappy human emotion um we can get back to that later because I do think there's something about the contrast of moving from these more painful emotions to happiness that's very different than moving from a state of immense happiness to slightly less but we can get back to that but most people would like to be happy as much as possible I certainly would who wouldn't and one of course can ask well should I work on my feelings like think about my feelings try and shift my feelings let my feelings move through me in a cathartic way um should I work on the thought patterns should I work on the behaviors I'm a big believer from from my own experience that behaviors are powerful in setting the general trajectory of thought patterns and feelings but I've also experienced it going the other way too so what does the research say about this and what what can we do cuz everyone wants to be happier yeah well we just talked about the thing you're not supposed to do you don't have to change your circumstances and that's great because like quintupling your income is tricky you know moving is tricky you know switching your life around all over the place is hard right the good news is design shows you don't have to do that that doesn't work as well as you think but you can hack your behaviors and your thought patterns and your feelings to get some good results right let's let's take behaviors right one of the biggest behavioral changes you can make to feel happier is just to get a little bit more social connection like psychologists do these fun studies where they look at people's like daily usage pattern so how much time are you spending sleeping or exercising or at work or whatever and the two things that predict whether or not you're happy or not so happy is how much time you spend with friends and family members and how much time you're just physically around other people like the more of that you do the happier you're going to be um and you know that's just a correlation right so your Savvy listeners are thinking right now like well is it that hanging around with other people causes you to be happy or do you tend to like hang out with other people more if you are happy like which direction does the causal Arrow go and here we have these lovely Studies by psychologists who do these kind of funny experiments where they offer people like a $10 Starbucks gift card to just talk to somebody um usually talk to a stranger like that they don't know on the train it's some lovely work by Nick Epley and others have done this becauseas you force people to get Social and what people predict especially with strangers is like oo that's going to feel awkward and kind of weird but what you find across the board and this includes in introverts and extroverts is that talking to somebody actually feels good it increases your positive emotion it gives you a sense that your life is going better you feel less lonely it just has these positive outcomes that we don't expect I love social connection the problem I have with social connection is that if I drop in with somebody for you know 30 minutes or a couple of hours when that's done I usually have so much that I need to tend to that I end up staying up later than I need to in order to complete that diminishing my sleep and then I feel like there's a underlying kind of like sinking ship sense to my physiology and then I have to recover my sleep so it you know everything's a trade-off yeah um what's interesting about the study you just mentioned is that it's just a brief coffee presumably so maybe one doesn't need to spend quite as much time um with people but I think uh you know I think like even years ago actually he's dead now but there was a I guess it's okay to say even though he's dead he was a somewhat excentric professor at UC Berkeley I took a class from him when I was a graduate student there named Seth Roberts he's known for some kind of bizarre theories about eating and if people want to look this up like really really kind of different stuff but I I applaud his bravery and just you know being out there but he was an accentric guy and he told us in this class when I was there that that it was very important to see faces um at least once a day real faces not on a screen this was before social media but um and that it was important at some point to leave your apartment and and like see the Barista and say hello and thank you and say see people on the street and um and now knowing what we know about these dedicated areas of the brain like the fusor face gyrus and Nancy kwish work and about about these brain areas like we are hardwired for seeing faces and recognizing faces now that alone doesn't mean that faces is a requirement for being happy on a consistent basis but I think they were on to something I think Seth was on to something even though he had some also just like completely crazy ideas this idea doesn't seem crazy this has been my experience even though I spent a lot of time alone if I go a few days without seeing a face MH something happens inside that that shifts the way my internal kind of um set point for well-being and then you see somebody and it's like it's like delightful even if it's just a hello kind of thing I think you know the reason why social connection matters so much is it's building off this basic neural circuitry right for seeing faces and so on I think that gives us real insight into the kinds of social connections that work best right which has been characterized in the field of sort of in real time social connection right which we're kind of moving away from so what do I mean by in real time you know you and I are sitting in a studio right now chatting and we're kind of chatting in real time I can see your face we're live but we might have been able to do this like over some sort of video chat wouldn't be as good you know but but it's pretty good and the reason it seems to be pretty good is we're doing it in real time right our auditory system our visual system all these systems that are used to as primates processing things with other folks around you it works reasonably well what doesn't work so well is how we often communicate which is like overs slack over text I text you few minutes later it comes back like our primate brains just like that that's just not the way communication is set to work and so I think sometimes when I bring up Social connection people think like oh got to see people in person and my friends going to live far away and I'm like at work all day it's like no no no you can connect not necessarily live and in person but as much as possible try to do it in real time and I think that's in part and if possible try to do it with video I think for the reason that you were just talking about is it faces activate us but you know we're primates that are also really good at language and paying attention to the voice I think it's one of the reasons that like an old school phone conversation no video chat with your friend can be some of the most emotional connective conversations sometimes is better than in person because when we're in person we're pulling out our phones and checking and paying attention to other stuff but but we got to get back towards in real time the other stuff just doesn't have the same psychological oomph is there any evidence that texting actually drives more of a desire for more social connection and thus leaves us feeling less well than prior to a text exchange I I I realize it's very hard to separate out the variables about what's the nature of the text exchange um you how often do you see this person in um in real life Etc but I could imagine that texting the I don't do the sound effect as well as you do I I like that uh but that texting could be the equivalent of getting crumbs of nourishment not full nourishment I could also imagine that it's like putting nourishment just Out Of Reach yeah and and I'm asking this really at a neurological level do we know does is the reward circuitry that's triggered by in real life social connection triggered but to a lesser degree by text exchange or by Zoom exchange this would be an important study to do I think yeah there's not great evidence for it but my intuition is that the way it works is almost like it's a texting sort of The neutr Suite of social connection right I was feeling his motivation for social connection and I did it and and I got something that was sort of social I got some information but like psychologically I'm missing the like nutritious part of it right so it kind of fakes you out into thinking that it's social connection but it kind kind of doesn't really work and I worry that that's what we're all getting a lot of right now right it's just so much easier to participate in the nutric version of social connection because as political scientists and sociologists and others have pointed out it's harder to meet with people in real life we don't have these so-called third spaces where we can get together easily anymore right there's so many draws of just being on your screen being alone inside um I think we're kind of missing out and so so a lot of us are kind of starving nutritionally when it comes to social connection we're going for the wrong stuff so schedule some if possible in real Lifetime with somebody or in real time right you know call that friend that you haven't talked to um and recognize because this is clear from the psychological research that your brain is not telling you to do that probably even when you're listening right now you're like yeah I guess that would be helpful for me but you're not kind of having a craving to talk to your friend and I think this is the problem with a lot of the behaviors that map on to happiness is that if you think of The evolutionary pressures for those behaviors natural selection never had to build in like the goal of feeling Social cuz we were just like in these small bands it was really easy right natural selection had to build in a kind of craving for sweet fatty food because those were hard to find didn't have to build in the craving for like you know a bunch of greens because they were everywhere I think the same thing is true with social connection we just don't have a strong motivation to seek people out because it was just kind of there and so I think our motivation our reward systems don't cause us to kind of crave it but in the modern day where there's so many substitutes and we're kind of more isolated I think many of us are kind of experiencing the negative effects of loneliness but then when we think well what could I do to get out of it there's not this like I'm starving for connection we don't have this sort of motivational goal to go out and get it and so what that can lead to is people making the prediction in their head of like you I just heard lri say that this is a good idea but like I don't know probably not for me or maybe not as important I think we just don't have systems that tell us to go out and get this stuff so even if your brain is saying it's not that important try it do your own personal experiment and get a little bit more in real time social connection and just take a moment to notice immediately after how it made you feel and I bet it'll be like you know all the kind of Fitness hacks and nutrition hacks that you talk about on the show where you're like oh my God that made me feel so much better than I really expected it to I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer if seeing faces and I don't have evidence for this but if Seth Roberts was right and what we're talking about here is clearly um based on existing data if seeing faces somehow triggers the reward system in a healthy way that reinforces the social connection thing like fills the vessel that like we're connected because we no longer live in small small village and tribe type formats most of us don't anyway that if we plop down onto the couch and kind of like assume the classic C c-shaped position of somebody who's about to go on their phone and and you can scroll and see faces you talked about that as a bit of like an artificial sweetener giving the illusion of some sort of nourishment and then you know you see some stuff you respond to stuff you can see someone kind of dunk on somebody maybe hear a joke maybe make a joke and then go into your DMs and like read a few check a you and then um you basically got no real social connection correct um you didn't have to move to do it um and in a lot of ways this has parallels to the ease of um highly processed foods or something like that and I think we're starting to understand this a bit through Jonathan height work and other people's work uh including your own but I don't know that it's anything but really dangerous and bad I don't want to sound alarmist but I I am really concerned that um certainly for the younger generation but that if we don't have an intrinsic drive to go do something we stop doing it we stop doing it and then the brain is pretty plastic throughout the entire life especially for these low-g grade like many times repeated behaviors I mean we can just slowly that you know it's like a dri there's drift and then we wonder why we don't feel so good yeah I mean you know how the dopamine system works right like it has these mechanisms to Crave stuff that's quick quick hits right our instant you know when we go on Reddit or go on Instagram and scroll through a feed we're getting these kind of quick hits another thing that is rewarding is new information you know you're Stanford College J zaki's done these lovely Neuroscience studies that just finding out some interesting social information feels rewarding and kind of for the first time we've been able to separate the reward value that comes from interacting with live Human people and faces and social rewarding information that comes at us quickly at this dopamine Hit That We crave a lot but we don't have the craving mechanisms for the in real life connection and yeah I think that's causing a lot of problems and it means we're kind of building more tools to do just that uh I had the musician David burn on on my podcast um Talking Heads David who cares a lot about these issues he wrote this really cool article in um called eliminating the human where he made the claim that pretty much every technological invention of the last 20 years has been you know dealing with actual people is kind of friction so let's just get rid of them right we'll you know have Uber or Lyft or a car company where I don't have to talk to the driver I just plug it into the phone we don't have to have a conversation we go away right we have music streaming mechanisms I don't know you're and Andrew you're like as my age so you probably remember that you used to have to go into a record store to flip through CDs or tapes even if you're old really old school to figure out music and often when you do that you'd run into humans or talk to the cashier guy or somebody would see you flicking through like oh you like Talking Heads I like Talking Heads now we just go to an algorithm right from food delivery apps to kind of education right I have a online course where students don't have to sit in a real classroom with other students they could watch it directly so many of our technological innovations are assuming that what we want to get rid of is the friction part that's what we're kind of motivated to get rid of but ultimately we're getting rid of like the human in these interactions and our primate brains are left you know with the like little nutrite dribbles of connection when what we really need is something in real life and in real time it's interesting because I think just but 10 15 years ago our knowledge of most all humans was based on in real life experience except for I guess famous humans and then it was not in real life now most people's knowledge about most humans is based on not in real life interactions which means that most people's knowledge about humans generally is kind of acing through non in real life electronic experiences and so that has to change our entire schema of like what human experience is I'm not trying to you know like ratchet up to something too abstract here but um I think it's a it's a powerful notion that what burn is saying that we're dehumanizing ourselves um through you know getting essentially fragments of of in real life experience maybe a and video is so captivating as you know as somebody who's was a vision scientist for a long time I mean if if a picture is worth a thousand words a video is worth 10 billion yeah pictures it's just like and the number of videos that you can access in in an Instagram feed or even on an X feed is just astonishing and then of course the high emotional Salient stuff is going to be the the stuff that you you hover on and then the algorithm knows your dwell time as it's called and then your your basic feed and Discovery is set by that and and you know I don't think it there's anything really inherently diabolical about it I don't take that stance it's just they figured out some good Neuroscience based on behavioral foraging yeah I mean the Diabolical part is is having a real consequence for our happiness certainly having a real consequence for loneliness you look at rates of loneliness in young people who've grown up with these Technologies and you see things like you know young people today report being lonely at rates of like 70 75% right more people are lonely extremely lonely than not right now how do we rate loneliness I'm not I'm not dismissing what they're saying but since they grew up that way I'm this sounds very this sounds very cross generational judgment but like how do they know they're lonely I mean your point is well taken right if anything they grow up lonely so if they're self-reporting being lonely now it might be even worse then it might be kind of getting worse over time yeah and so I mean it's all self-report data right so people you know on a scale of 1 to 10 how lonely are you feeling but the fact that 75% of people are saying yeah I feel extremely lonely that's sad I mean our Prime ancestors if they could look at us would be like what have you these wonderful social bra they were probably like I want to go hide behind that rock for a little bit get a little bit of space I'll never forget years ago when I uh uh there was this time when I worked with ferrets I don't miss it and and uh they would have these huge litters and there were these in these um pens they the um the the mom could climb up and get up on top there and so she'd have these huge litters and she'd kick the litter off at some point she'd go up there and sleep and um and you'd go in there to take to take out the moms and um and uh they did not that was the only time when they didn't want to be bothered right because they they love they love to be held and things like that but they did not want to be bothered because they just needed some peace cuz they had like 16 fit kits you know so I think that nowadays right if if there's if there's a lot of loneliness um and people that are growing up in these electronic formats report feeling lonely and I believe them then what it speaks to is a yearning and to me a yearning is a neurological Drive the same way that a room that's too warm you want to get to a cooler space it's too cold you want to get to heat so that loneliness speaks to an underlying yearning for something that they're not getting I'm just stating the obvious but it says that we're or they are doing something that's inherently against the grain of their healthy neurology the problem is I think what loneliness is a recognition of is you know you kind of don't like this state but I'm not sure that loneliness is causing people to seek out more social connection or if it is you're seeking out the thing that is the easiest fastest social connection you can get this is just like food which we talked about is the nut you're not craving vegetables because they were in presumably in abundance at one time in our evolutionary history as opposed to meat or sweets or things like that fruit and meat and I think this is a problem with social connection but I think it's a problem generally with the kinds of things that make us happier because like we just don't have mechanisms to seek those things out they just kind of don't code in our reward system in the same way as you know the neutr sweey stuff of the world so what is the the term if there is one um or could you come up with one I don't want to put you on the spot for a um a fundamental um desire that healthy for us that we are not driven to pursue a a resolution to like for everything else you know there's like the hypothalamic circuits for the desire to mate to seek warmth when it's cold cold when it's you know when it's too warm um you know we know what hunger is right um but there must be something about the I don't want to get too technical here for for those that are are tracking this what or not tracking this what I'm trying to say is you know for so many of the um reward punishment Pathways in the human brain it's you you're trying to avoid the feelings of pain and move toward a feeling of either neutrality or pleasure but here you're talking about being in a in a sort of place of low-level pain being able to meet that pain with a truly low-level pleasure that then it doesn't mask the pain but it it fills the vessel just enough that then you drive yourself into a place of essentially more pain but I think that this is the kind of thing that happens when you have easy outs for all these Cravings right I mean take process food right you you probably have a a craving for certain nutritional requirements right you want to get vitamins or healthy stuff but that stuff's easy it's frictionless right you know I run to McDonald's and that's much faster than cooking up a really healthy vegetable filled meal I think the same thing happens with social connection right like you're lonely person at your house sitting on the couch you have this negative bodily state of you feel lonely maybe it kind of manifests as a craving but what's the fastest thing for you to do I'm going to scroll through my friend's Instagram feeds um or I'm going to get a kind of little mini hit of social connection that's not as nutritious honestly I mean not to diss our respective Fields but I actually think this is one reason that people love podcasts so much right it's a frictionless way to feel like you're part of this interesting conversation but ultimately it doesn't work as well as picking up the phone and calling a friend connecting with someone in real life I think we have too many outlets for things that kind of feel socially but don't give us social nutrition and it's true I mean we should be honest like really connecting with actual people in real life takes more friction than pulling out your phone and scrolling through your Instagram feed it just the Instagram feed doesn't work as well ultimately when it comes to what's really going to end up being rewarding and I think this is true for just like a lot of the way the reward system works the things that we have craving for that we seek out that like we have really strong mechanisms to go after sometimes those things don't work to get us towards real likability um you know drugs of addiction are a real obvious answer to this right you know if you have a a kind of heroin problem you're going to really seek out that drug But ultimately it's not bringing you towards something I mean it will maybe feel good in the moment but it's you know no you're not neutr sweee but it's not getting you towards something that evolutionarily would be really awesome for your survival and reproductive success well I try my best not to speak in tweets which I guess they now call expost but um I've been saying a lot and I'll say it again now that I think one everyone should beware any dopamine that is not preceded by effort in order to achieve it uh in other words any fast High inflection of dopamine that does not require effort to achieve it is going to put you in a trough and on a you know a metaphorical lever pressing cycle that will drive your trough deeper and deeper over time and that Peak will just never go as high as it did or could again unless you take a period of abstinence from that behavior or substance and then introduce effort prior to a adaptive Behavior to get the dopamine the other thing is I've um thought I like to think of addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure mhm um and I don't speak to Enlightenment but happiness or Enlightenment seems like a progressive um broadening of the things that bring you pleasure and I'm glad we're talking about reward circuitry because we know how to reset that reward circuitry and it doesn't require these dopamine fasts although that's one approach and that makes sense why people do it but I think this notion of having to spend effort to engage in what we know as a hardwired source of reward not just dopamine but other neurochemicals as well of course in the form of social connection so this higher friction thing of having to call somebody or drive someplace or deal with traffic deal with traffic on the way home yeah well worth it if it was a good social interaction but maybe it wasn't a me social interaction in which case you're like that was that was a lot of driving today now all this other stuff to do other times a great social interaction can set you in an amazing uh tional plane for days if not weeks yeah so you know I think um what you're bringing up is really important how how do we um introduce these behaviors not asking you to put it into a standardized protocol too much but since we started with this issue of behaviors being a path to more happiness and social connection being the uh in real life social connection or by phone in real time as you said being one of the main paths to behavioral happiness behaviorally derived happiness excuse me then what are the data on sort of the frequency of this does it vary for introverts versus extroverts this question is getting very long but maybe we could Define introverts and extroverts and then if you would if you could give us some sense of you know how often should people seek out an in real life interaction yeah probably way more than you think you should right we have good data on what people predict which is that people predict social interactions just not going to be that fun um it's not going to be worth it right this seems to be a spot where our predictions about how good something's going to be don't necessarily match how good it ultimately will going to be right and I I put it in the context of like other the the reverse of something like processed food where I think for a lot of people you predict this is going to be amazing and you taste you're like now I feel kind of gross processed food processed food right that's a case where your prediction is like oh this is going to be awesome but your actual likeability is like H I feel kind of yucky where social connection I think we predict be all right but maybe not that good but when we get it we feel really great um the the the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley has this term he uses UND sociality where he thinks we just kind of don't get the right reward benefit of social connection a RIT large right he talks about examples of you know expressing gratitude to people giving somebody a compliment even things like asking for help right all these domains where we can kind of connect with another person we sort of was like yeah it may be net good if I was rating it on some scale but it winds up being way better than we predict in all these contexts um he does these studies where he has people you know pred how good something will be you know giving a gift to somebody brings he's in Chicago right so he's like here's a hot chocolate how how good will it feel to like you know give that guy over there a stranger the hot chocolate and people say you know I don't know three out of 10 but then they do it and then they feel oh it's like more like a six out of 10 it was much more rewarding for me the giver than I thought same thing with compliments expressing gratitude calling a friend you haven't talked to in a long time reaching out to somebody that you care about but you haven't connected with all these spots are ones where our predictions are off it's not the veilance that's off we know it'll be good but we just don't realize how good and his argument is that if we don't realize how good then we never seek it out so it's kind of the opposite of what you might think of as the processed food problem where our prediction is like oh my God that cupcake is going to be so good we have all these mechanisms that are like Go Get It Go Get it but then we actually get it we're like that wasn't as good as we thought I think that the problem is that we have all these things that work like the processed food that interfere with social connection going on the Reddit feed you know plopping down and watching Netflix just kind of being by yourself right there's all these alternative behaviors that we're predicting are going to feel nice but then we get there they feel kind of yucky they just um yeah this is a problem in the happiness space where I know you talk a lot about the reward system but the happiness space is one where the re the Cravings we have the rewards we seek out the predictions we're making about what feels good we're often just really wrong with them you know my podcast we talk a lot about like our mind lies to us when it comes for happiness you know we go for more money we go for accolades you know we go for the quick dopamine hits without any work but really it's more like social connection it's all these things that we kind of don't expect are going to feel good and so I actually don't know what that means evolutionarily like my theory is like you didn't need to build in craving mechanisms because the things that really matter for our happiness we just kind of got for free in The evolutionary environment but it means it's hard to go after them you mentioned introverts and extroverts and just to get back to your longer question this is something that's been studied in them so so introverts versus extroverts is typically thought of as a personality distinction often thought of as sort of something that's built in although there's lots of evidence that over time you can sort of change these things around you could become a little bit more extroverted if you're introverted um but introverts tend to Value deeper close conversations one-on-one kinds of things and a lot of alone time they get a lot of benefit from alone time whereas extroverts tend to be more energized by being around other people especially bigger crowds of people um and so introverts tend to be a little bit more deliberate a little bit more thoughtful a little bit more kind of want to have my own personal chill time whereas extroverts tend to like people and so you might think that everything I've just said applies to extroverts but not to introverts folks have gone out and tested this and what they find is there is a big difference between introverts and extroverts but it's in that prediction error you know extroverts predict ah social connection be all right not that great introverts predict it's going to be terrible it's going to be awkward I'm going to hate it but when you actually force people as in these studies where you say hey $10 Starbucks gift card you got to talk to somebody when you force the introverts to be social what they wind up doing is self-reporting you know a level of Happiness that's like better than they expected so the problem seems to be that introverts have a prediction error I'm going to say this you're going to where I promise you because I've said this on my podcast tons of hate mail lots of the comments will be like not me not this introvert or maybe they don't they don't quite understand so I want to make sure that um it's Crystal Clear for people introverts anticipate a less than great or even eh um interaction maybe even a negative interaction usually negative usually Negative they anticipate a negative interaction um you so it's like saying we're going to go to a restaurant and the food here Terri sucks they go in they have a decent to maybe a great interaction so introverts are are um positioned to derive more more pleasure from social interactions than ex extroverts who enter social situations thinking it's going to be great their their dissipation is high and therefore they require a much bigger dopamine inflection um in order to come away from that interaction saying it was great although the one kind of update to the framework that you just presented I'd add is that you said you know well if you don't you go to the restaurant you predict it's going to be not that good and you go and you're like oh it's all right I think the problem with introverts is they so predict that social connection is going to be awkward that they don't engage in it and now this becomes a learning cycle right you predicted it was going to be crappy you never got any evidence oh maybe I was wrong and so you keep doing that over time and so I think that this can lead to cycles of loneliness in introverts um and there these lovely accounts of like introverts who try to become a little bit more extroverted I had this lovely woman Jessica pan on the show is this book called sorry I'm late I didn't want to come uh colon I I love that I'm actually pretty social but I'm late to everything CU I'm an academic noon means noon 10 which means starting at 12:15 which means at 1:15 when this when the lecture was supposed to end at 1 you're still going and half the room is full this is not just like she had a reason any academic knows what I'm talking about yeah I know I'm with you I'm with you but dude sorry I'm late I didn't want to come colon an introvert's guide to extrovert so she did this year where as a super hardcore introvert she talked to people joined an improv comedy group like went to these social networking kind of busy nasty social connection events just did all this stuff and what she found was two things one is that she actually did enjoy it a lot more than she thought at the end of the year she was much happier than she expected but she also watched her habits changing too and and this is a thing I think that we also get wrong about introverts and extroverts as we assume I'm born that way you know never going to change and it is true that there are predispositions towards this stuff but the data suggests that if you can maybe like update your reward value of this you as an introvert try a little social connection don't go to like the hugest party ever or jump in improv comedy just try call a friend that you haven't talked to in a while right notice how that felt like oh I was I was a prediction error right I actually felt better than I expected then you might update your prediction and get and so you can kind of update your introversion in part by trying things out and noticing the reward value you get I think the thing that is different for introverts is like you definitely need your alone time right so you want to balance any social connection you get with a little bit of time by yourself but but the research really shows that if you're predicting right now like I just don't like the social connection you might actually like it more than your prediction is suggesting I don't want to micro disect social interactions to the point of becoming artificial but I'm fairly introverted I love New York City and I love London I love busy cities um so I don't mind being surrounded by people but one byproduct of being surrounded by people in a big city is you're not interacting with everybody you're seeing lots of faces so is it the case that introverts are really uncomfortable in big social interactions or you know to me um the most mentally demanding social interaction would be one where I go to a party where I know there's going to be like 20 people everyone's going to have to go around the room and introduce themselves goodness yeah um clearly I don't have a problem with public speaking but that to me just like spikes my cortisol immediately um and then there's sort of an expectation of of like real connection the the expectation of real connection often sometimes undermines real connection sometimes it serves it yeah but is it the case that introverts want to avoid people or they want to avoid um the requirement to really engage in a in a deep way and I like engaging in a deep way one to one or maybe with two or three people you know maybe a few more but I'm I don't know that it's the number of people that becomes overwhelming or daunting or the punishing feature it's more you know the sort of requirement to like be pulled out of oneself yeah I think it might be all of the above I mean I think what we know about introverts is that they often self-report being better in these sort of one-on-one kind of things so as an introvert it's like you're going to have a coffee date with your friend that often doesn't cause as much Social Anxiety as like you know the dinner party with a bunch of people right and so that's the claim it's not like well jump into the dinner party with a bunch of people or join improv promd group or talk to everyone on the street it's like just a one-on-one little mini conversation can be great um and much or not just like great but much better than you expect and we'll kind of have this happiness benefit that kind of sustains you over time um Nick Epley who does all this work talks about your happiness the best metaphor for happiness is that it's kind of like a leaky Tire like it sort of goes out a little bit and each one of these little conversations whether it's chatting with the Barista calling a friend giving someone a compliment whatever kind of fills up the tire and then it kind of goes down so you can sort of use these little mini micro does of social connection to boost your happiness Tire I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from talk doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com / huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by

just be built into modern living now as one of the primary drivers for Behavioral approaches to improve what we're calling happiness so could we say and I know we don't want to set up strict protocols around this you know make the effort to schedule in real time over the phone or Zoom or in real life interaction with somebody maybe once a week yeah minimum I think more than you're doing now if you're not feeling so happy add some in and and again as you mentioned before these are all kind of trade-offs right you don't want to add so much in them now you're not sleeping or exercising or all that other stuff but like one more interaction than you're getting now and check how it feels over time given how busy people are and given that we've established that some effort that's required to engage socially is going to be beneficial toward the the reward and all this and we're not trying to hack the dopamine system here folks we're just trying to figure out what is going to be rewarding given that everyone has constraints on their time and everyone seems to have a device in their pocket that allows them to get the um the illusion of nourishment that leads to either same levels or less happiness overall um you know what's going to be most effective and it seems to me I was thinking about this sure in one of your answers I was paying attention but I was thinking about this that my memory of Prior social interactions as really great is a useful tool so for instance one of my best memories of time with my girlfriend was driving back from her grandmother's house with the dog in the car and we had no phone reception so we couldn't be interrupted by our devices she actually had some work to do so she was doing some work on her computer at one point she may have taken a nap at one point and the dog kept jumping back and forth between our laps and that to me was like one of the best days ever MH MH just ever it was just an awesome day um that memory occurred to me now and I think could serve me well and thinking okay so like going on a road trip with somebody but it was the it was the lack of um kind of structure around it it was just imposed on us we had a drive to complete was a dog in the car there was some work to do there was no phone reception and of you know we've had many great interactions but that would be the one that I'd highlight as like that was an awesome interaction for whatever reason yeah and so can one use memories of great social interaction as kind of a um as a compass for how to construct these um these social plans yeah um because I think it can be a little bit um mystifying to people like oh how do I get this thing called Happiness by meeting up with a friend we enjoy hiking or something like that but maybe that's not accessible and I don't want people to underthink or overthink it yeah but to me it seems like okay like road trips everyday things we needed to go up there there was some things to tend to so like tending to life things yeah life requirements together yeah I mean if you want to ask yourself a question that can high good memories I recommend the one that uh the journalist Katherine price uses a lot she does a lot of studies on fun ask yourself the question what what three times that you just had the most fun the last three times you would describe as oh my God that was the most fun right and this is a helpful question because usually the answer my guess is at least two out of three probably all three will have someone else in it like they'll be you'll have like another person involved or a dog Sometimes some other agentive being right it wasn't you by yourself it probably didn't involve a screen right and so that's kind of and and that actually gets back to your your road trip you know talked about I think the the social part was really important but but it seems like that road trip also tapped into a sort of thought pattern that we know is really good for happiness which is presence right just being kind of mindful you're paying attention to the dog flopping on you you're seeing the scenery right you're not in a rush to do something so your mind could kind of be on that drive and how it felt um and we know so much about how kind of these moments of mindfulness really paying attention to your sensory experience how that how much that matters for happiness and one of the biggest tasks you can use to get more presence is to do exactly what you accidentally did driving through these parts of the world that where you don't get phone receptions which is to get rid of our phones um you know our phones are just like the biggest attention Stealers ever and it makes a lot of sense because what grabs our attention um things that are really interesting and provide a little lots of quick dopamine hits right or just kind of scream at us with information and announcements and so on this is what our phones do really well and our brains aren't stupid our brains know that on the other side of our phone is like such rewarding content and it becomes you know really distracting um my my colleague Liz Dunn uh has this kind of analogy she uses like you know imagine you know instead of this kind of conversation we're having right here maybe I'll do with my husband at a dinner party where I'm sitting my husband at dinner and we're chatting and I have my phone out and my husband's a philosopher he's a very smart guy we have great conversations but I know on the other end of that phone is like really interesting stuff and let said imagine the comparison is instead of having your phone there I had this big wheelbarrow next to me and my husband at our dinner table and in the wheelbarrow was photo albums of every photo I've taken since 2016 physical printouts of my emails and news articles and stuff that I could get you know like videotapes of cat videos and porn and everything just like piled up really high in this wheelbarrow if we were trying to have a conversation that wheelbarrow was there I'd be like oh I just want to take a quick look at the photo or do something it'd be so distracting it'd be so interesting your brain's not stupid your brain knows even though your phone is much tinier than that wheelbarrow that all that interesting dopamine Rich exciting stuff is on it and it makes it hard to pay attention to my husband again an interesting philosopher we have great conversations and so there's lots of evidence showing that even the act of having your phone out is subtly stealing your attention from other people from the tasks that you're doing one of the biggest pieces of advice I give my college students is to study without your phone near you because Princeton Studies have looked at this where you have somebody do say a math test or a studying test with your phone there versus the phone in the other room and you see like double digit increases in performance just to have your phone away and you might ask like well why would that be it's like well part of your frontal Lo is like no no no don't look at the phone don't look at the phone don't look at that big wheelbarrow of delicious interesting stuff stay on task and that's this kind of constant moment of multitasking where we're kind of yanking our brain back onto task and so a big hat if you want to be more present is to find ways to do activities without your phone I guess if we go back to that fun question if I said you know those three times you're having most fun you weren't in the middle of it pulling out your phone to like look at your Instagram feed you were just there and what you just described was a dramatic performance enhancement on mathematics by not having this opportunity for distraction in the room which is incredible yeah I mean that when you look when you dive deep into the effects of having your phone around you they're striking especially getting back to social connection especially social connection Liz Dunn has this paper where she um puts two people in a room just kind of a waiting room together and you either have your phone or you don't you're not allowed to look at it it's just present and she finds that there's 30% less smiling at the other people in the waiting room when your phones are present 30% less um I mean I actually think of this when I think of the you know the loneliness crisis you know I walk I was a head of college on campus which is a faculty member at Yale meant that I lived on campus with students and you'd walk through the courtyard and everybody's walking through the courtyard but they're not looking at you they're looking down at their phone right um there these like subtle interactions that we're missing because our phone is stealing us that's the social case but I think there's a real performance case too right if you want to pay attention and learn something if part of your brain is inhibiting that urge to look at all the interesting stuff on your phone which we don't notice um then it's going to be affecting your performance has good benefits too there's this lovely um finding that people are buying less gum and less candy in checkout aisles now um the like the national worldwide sale of gum has gone down and it's gone down on the same slope as the iPhones have gone up so as number of iPhones in Pockets goes up sales of gum and checkout lines has gone down and you can see why that is you're not looking around as you're not looking like o that you know like double mitt looks really good you're staring at your phone and looking your Instagram soon the ads are going to pop up on uh they'll know you're in the aisle cuz they can know you have proximity to a lot of devices I have a friend who a very accomplished songwriter and musician um and someone does his Instagram and other social media for him he he's not on there and we met for dinner the other day uh with a couple other people and I got there and I started telling him about something I had seen uh online and he said um I won't use it I usually will do his voice but I won't do his voice because I don't want to give it away uh people might know who he is um but he said I don't want to talk about what's on Instagram in fact I don't want to talk on about what's on the internet let's just have dinner and I was and at first I was like dude that was like kind of and I thought great like he's exactly right like it's not just having the phone there it's not just being on the device it's also that you're talking about things that you saw in the world um some of which are very interesting and important um at times but what he was saying was I don't want to talk about things that that you experienced about somebody else's experience that wasn't really an experience that you had today that's an experience of an someone else's experience that you had today it wasn't about a news article or something so we're playing the telephone Bucket Brigade game of social connection many many degrees away from the the actual interactions that we were kind of hardwired to experience ourselves yeah and those are the ones that really influ uence our our happiness in the world right you know one of the great ways to increase your presence in addition to kind of getting rid of your phone is to just go back to your sensus right what are you what are you looking at right now what do you see right now I'm in this room there's like really nice kind of cool black lighting and I'm sitting there I'm hearing your voice there's like a subtle hum in the room that I hope the podcast is not picking up that I hear in the audio right it's a little cool that grounding I can watch my breath completely change around it's like a quick way to just kind of be embodied and I think so often we're just not doing that as much you know in our discourse but but definitely like even when we're by ourselves you know we just wind up distracting ourselves from the very sensory experience that like literally is the experience that we have of the world just not noticing it as much now I will say that um a memory of a really terrific time I had alone was around this time of year actually around the holidays typically I would be in my office um organizing papers deal some end end of year stuff is it for academics you know my life's a lot different now with the podcast even though I still teach at Stanford but the but end of year is the time when you kind of get your office organized everyone every academic knows this and um over the holidays I tended to have a lot of time in my office alone it was a great time to come in like parking was everywhere you go in and and I used to listen to Ted Talks or I would listen to podcast and these days I'm trying to do more physical things not just exercise but um working on some like lighting stuff in my house and and I like to listen to podcasts or books y sometimes music but podcasts or books while I do that and I I do feel that when when we're alone sometimes it's nice to have other voices in the room that are not just the voices in our head yeah and it could be music podcasts books movies Etc that people seem to find that soothing I certainly do and that doesn't feel like it's diminishing from my experience of being present in fact it allows me to just really tend to what I'm doing mechanically M um and I have some plans to do some more like craft drawing type projects in the new year and I look forward to being able to hear those conversations but not have to participate in them yeah yeah yeah so is this would you consider that sort of healthy or um am I diminishing my experience and of the depth of my uh my crafts yeah well I think it you know there's there's some Nuance there right you're talking about your craft in a very embodied way even as you're talking to me you're describing how your hands are moving in these motorways as you're doing it you're talking about kind of what it felt like it felt like you your senses were activated for the physical stuff you were doing um but you also mentioned that your mind was wandering and maybe you're ruminating and stuff like that so it sounds like what you did was have a really nice emotion regulation strategy of like you could kind of fill your head with something so that you can work on the physical stuff but it didn't impede your experience of the physical stuff the way you described it shows that you were there you were present when you were doing it I think the problem was is when it impedes our presence doing it and I think it kind of depends on activity we're doing right um you know take driving probably some of you who are listening right now or sitting in your car as you're driving doing this other interesting motoric activity and that's one where it's like you're not missing out on that much on the drive by like listening to us it's probably a positive kind of experience that you're having learning something and so on but you know you wouldn't want to listen to podcasts in some physical situations right um we can kind of come you wouldn't you know if you're were ballroom dancing for example you wouldn't want to necessarily be listening to a podcast then right um you know if you're really experiencing art and sort of engaging with art in an art gallery you wouldn't want to also be listening to a podcast at the same time and so I think the thing to think is are you listening to this in a way that you're missing something in the real world that your presence of it would matter make you feel really good um or are you kind of just like you know killing some other free time and maybe using this as a nice emotion regulation strategy to stop what would otherwise be a really ruminative drive now you get to listen to me and Andrew and that's probably better but but there's Nuance there I think our tendency is to move away from the rumination is to run away from it and I think if you find yourself kind of avoiding your thought patterns alt together that probably might be the pendulum swinging a little too far in the other direction noted noted so we've got in real time Andor in real life well in real life is always in real time but uh in real life Andor in uh real time social interaction and if it requires some effort to plan or get to yeah organize all the better you stand to gain more from those interactions so that's really key presence obviously try and get the phone out of the room at least off and put away but ideally out of out of sight out of sight love that um and shared experience presumably you know actually maybe doing something but it could even just be talking I guess it depends on what people enjoy doing right yeah yeah so these are powerful levers for shifting one level of Happiness up uh using Behavior what about leading with thought patterns or feelings seems like it's a a more challenging but um certainly tractable entry point yeah and I think it's it's important here to remember like what are our natural evolutionary patterns towards thought patterns um because some of them aren't necessarily built for our happiness you know to take what's a kind of common evolutionary thought pattern which is a negativity bias right we're just built to notice all the scary stuff all the bad stuff all the potentially risky stuff our brains instantly go there and that makes fabulous evolutionary sense like if there's a possibility that there's a tiger that's going to jump out or some sort of risky thing you want your brain to lock onto it not as evolutionary beneficial to notice all the blessings in life just all the good things it doesn't really give you that much of a survival benefit to notice hey there's the absence of a tiger we don't really know there's no Tigers around right in fact it it probably helps Drive um more motivation to go pursue resources I mean you could imagine an Adaptive feature to um lacking satisfaction I mean you can gain more resources and at a time where resources were presumably shared more in these small village formats I don't know do monkey troops share resources uh depends on the monkey depends on the monkey just like humans depends on the depends on the monkey but but I think you're you're making a really critical point right which is like if we're noticing the negative if we're noticing the bad stuff we tend to fix it but also if we're craving if we're wanting if we're kind of constantly in search of something we get off our butts and go do stuff I mean Steve Jobs and his parting words were stay hungry stay foolish or maybe it was stay foolish stay hungry but stay hungry was definitely in there and I realize he's not going to represent the epitome of what to strive for for everybody but he certainly held up as somebody who uh changed the world um through the development of certain Technologies so we rever these people that are um that are hungry for more yeah right um and it makes great evolutionary sense doesn't make as good happiness sense right what's one of the best ways to be happy to just appreciate what you have to notice and appreciate the blessings out there but it we got to push against this natural negativity bias to do this so how do we do that well it turns out that this is a spot where harnessing attention in the way we were just talking about can be really helpful just taking time to notice the blessings notice kind of all the good stuff um it's often talked about in terms of a gratitude practice although gratitude sounds kind of cheesy I don't know um my uh friend Katherine price who I mentioned earlier she has this practice that calls a delight practice where you just notice Delights in the world I love the word delight you know I walked in your studio you had a picture of your bulldog and I was like that's a delight that's so cute just like thank for delighting in him I Delight in him too even though he's dead several years now um Delight is a wonderful word yeah and we can train our brain to notice them right you can literally have a practice where you know put in your notes app on your phone like a list of delights or even better pick a friend like I have with Katherine where you can just like text them Delight you know at the end of this I'll you know text like saw a really cute dog Delight or heard this really funny song Delight then you get the social connection and the Gratitude but what that does is if you have this practice where you got to write down the Delights your brain starts to automatically be on the lookout for them it becomes rewarding because you get to write this thing down now all of a sudden it can be a practice that you're sort of Shifting your negativity bias to notice more of the good things that are out there um and there's so much evidence suggesting that people who naturally notice the blessings in the world are happier um if you do one of these kind of gratitude or Delight practices you wind up happier son your Luber Mercy has this lovely study where if you scribble down three to five things you're grateful for three to five Delights in as little as two weeks you significantly improve your overall satisfaction with life right I love that super free so much so that I and because I accidentally interrupted the comments always tell me I interrupt too much it's out of interest it's out of Interest I promise if I could interrupt myself I would um and I probably do from time to time could you repeat what the it's three to five things yeah three to five things you're grateful for I'm not sure if the number really matters but it's committing to kind of noticing the good things in life and really trying to take a moment to notice how they felt right you know so if I look at I do Delight practices sometimes or gratitude practices and it's things like my husband you know these big things in life but then sometimes it's like my morning coffee or like probably you know seeing your cute dog like it's funny to see the picture for folks that don't know Andrew Studio it's a picture of his dog on a microphone it's just very funny it's a giant high quality photograph he was actually standing on the table that I do my solo podcast from with the at the microphone and his tag just happened to rotate a few deg toward the camera just at that moment um so you could see his name Costello you know and I invite listeners to pause right now and notice what's happening to their face as you hear Andrew say that probably you're just smiling right you didn't even see this really cute photo uh but you're also smiling That's The Power of delights right not just noticing them yourself but potentially sharing them too and so this is another thought pattern practice that we can engage in which is like just train your brain to find these things and what you'll find is that you know there's a there's a limited ratio of the stuff we can focus our attention on if we start shifting towards the Delights from the hassles and the yucky stuff in life now we're just kind of filling our brain with stuff that gives us a little more positive emotion what I love about this conversation about gratitude is I must say I do like the word delight more than gratitude gratitude sounds cheesy it sounds a little hippie dippy I got to say yeah well I'm from Northern California so I'm cool with hippie dippy even though I'm not a hippie punk rocker not a Hipp you're Berkeley rud c yeah I know I'm from the other end of the B the peninsula I love I love the anyway this is getting but the point is um it's not that the word feels soft I need to think about this a little bit more it's that um maybe it's just that Delight is such a powerful unselfish word MH like it's not taking anything from anybody it's not requiring a a shift away from one's sort of um intrinsic self I feel like gratitude requires this like okay I'm going to now be grateful it's like kind of like pulling if if you're not already in a state of gratitude I feel like there's more effort involved and we've been saying effort that precedes reward is good but with delight it feels like it's just very much um in concert with almost like who one is yeah you know and and like I Delight in Costello I don't expect everyone to Delight in Costello people who did I delighted in their Delight so it was just you know amplifying all the Delight but the thing that really strikes me about Delight is that every example you gave it's very rapid time scale M like you you know like I will say I I normally drink yamate during these things which I Delight in but today I decided I haven't had coffee in a while took a little break from it for no particular reason and I had a single shot of espresso and I I was thinking to myself this is really so this is a this is a fast time skill maybe it was the fact I haven't had it in a little while um and it's just really fast no one suffers it's all game and so it runs a little bit countercurrent to we were talking about before which is the requirement for effort to precede the reward Delight feels like a like a very smooth Road um to a reward that's all net positive and as you said these these Delights are available throughout the day and it doesn't it requires just noticing something inside and outside whereas I feel like with gratitude I love gratitude practices the data are incredible it is is anything but but but squishy it was like real power tool for shifting one's one's state of mind that's clear from the literature but the Gratitude thing I I feel like requires an almost like a a formalization like okay I'm going to be grateful now whereas Delight you're just kind of on the lookout for things that spark you and make you um reflexively smile and and and few things are better than that yeah and I think it's really sensory you know in the way we were talking about before right it gets you back into being present most of these Delights are something you taste or you experience or you see that's funny um there's a really lovely book by the author Ross gay called The Book of delights and and he used a delight practice where every day he not only had to find a delight but write a short essay about it because he's an author and it's just hilarious it's like one of my favorite books and you just kind of go and it's really strange things it's like when ises he you know notice the flower as he notices lilacs and he has this whole idea of one delay is purple flowers why are there so many purple flowers there's purple flowers everywhere he also has a delight in music he really likes the' 8s band El dear you know from the be of the r familiar he talks about his love of De and you can kind of have this connection with other people's Delights and and it's silly they're just silly things but the fact that we've notice them I mean again as a listener is probably experiencing right now if you pay attention little bit of positive emotion right if you're driving around your car feeling a little stressed out in traffic you can kind of take a breath and so that's the power of the practice you're you're shifting your emotions because you're noticing these good things you're noticing the good things which is great you're sort of training your attention to get there and you're sort of forming this habit to shift that negativity bias that's sort of built in but isn't really making you as happy as you could be I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 gram of protein only 150 calories and0 gram of sugar that's right 28 gram of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein These Bars from David also taste amazing my favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough but then again I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one and I also like the cake flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're incredibly delicious for me personally I strive to eat mostly Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source with David I'm able to get 28 grams of protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and it allows me to do that without taking in excess calories I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon or even midafternoon if I want to bridge that gap between lunch and dinner I like that it's a little bit sweet so it tastes like a tasty snack but it's also giv me that 28 gram of very high quality protein with just 150 calories if you would like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is david.com huberman I've long been interested in shifting one's emotions and when that feels good when it is good and when it doesn't feel good um I asked our friend Ethan cross about this too um I'm not going to compare your answers as a as a template for who's right who's wrong I think there there are a lot a lot of differing opinions on this but um I know from the time we are young kids we don't like to be shifted like we don't like people to impose an emotional requirement on us in fact my niece when she was little I was telling her this she's 18 now she was not amused um which which delighted me that she was not amused but when she was little she was um a pretty healthily stubborn kid and um you'd ask her to do anything like hey let's go downstairs for a walk and she loved going outside for walks and she'd say no push me and then she would get her stuff and then you'd go for a walk but I loved her like no push me I love this it was also Costello was like a don't push me you couldn't um so there was this like immediate vocalization from the time she could speak really was like no I'm going to decide how I feel such a healthy thing too such a healthy thing you're not going to shift me I like we're going out for a walk it's going to be fun and she's like no push me and then she'd go for the walk most of the times it was a fun walk but I think that we we don't like to be shifted MH and in some ways we don't really like to shift ourselves like when we're in a given emotion MH uh when people are feeling upset like they don't want to be told they should feel happy yeah um and yet no one really wants to be upset although there's this do you know this result I don't want to um spin off into it a long discussion about this but Robert Heath a very controversial neurosurgeon from the um like 70s and 80s did these experiments of stimulating in different parts of the brain allowing people to self-stimulate different parts of their brain and all there were only three subjects because it's a yeah inv Vivo human neuros stimulation experiment all three subjects by far their favorite area to uh stimulate was this midline Central nucleus midline midline thalamic nucleus rather all three of them reported that the The Sensation that they would lever pressed the most for was frustration and Mild anger mhm humans like that excuse my language Nega look the horror movie industry would not exist if we didn't like fear right the the honestly like Twitter X whatever we're calling it now would not exist if we didn't like outrage right these are kind of complicated negative emotions that have have some positive benefit to us and I think that this is something that people get wrong when they hear my line of research you know I tell people like oh I teach this class about happiness at Yale and people will say like oh you just want everybody to be happy you sort of embrace this toxic positivity and I'm like no no no toxic positivity toxic positivity yeah it's this idea I mean you kind of see it in our culture right now it's the sort of Good Vibes only right it's this idea that anything that feels you know mildly frustrating or like hard to do it's like oh no no do that it's like Good Vibes only right and there's this idea that if you're experiencing negative emotions if you feel sad or you feel a little lonely or you feel a little upset at politics whatever it is that something's wrong or you got to take a pill or you got to do something to fix it right and I think that's a really dangerous idea right because it's getting rid of this signal that we've been built to experience evolutionarily that's really important right if you're experiencing outrage that's telling you something super crucial if you're experiencing kind of frustration overwhelm is a big one if you're kind of feeling oh I'm so overwhelmed at work and I'm burned out that's a really useful signal about behavioral changes you should make um in class I often tell my students that negative emotions are like that that dashboard on your car you know you go in your car and you're like you know sometimes you're driving the tire light comes on or the engine light comes on and and that's a pain in the ass honestly because you're like well I got to deal with it but so it's not fun when these lights come on but it's super useful information that if you actively ignore it for months and months is going to cause a much bigger your problem later on and I think this is how all of our negative emotions work you know if you're feeling that you know negative emotion of loneliness means you need more social connection if you're feeling overwhelmed it means probably got to take something off your plate before you burn out or get sick if you're feeling sad like that's probably because of some you know stimulus that matters that it's like you're not there anymore if you're feeling grief and so on I think too often we just like want to get rid of those we don't like them so we want to suppress those emotions um but that but suppressing our emotions is giv up useful evolutionary information that probably means we can take action to to fix and feel better Americans might be surprised to hear this but um I learned this from my father who's from South America he's from Argentina went to British schools when he was young and he told me when I was probably 10 or 12 I can't remember exactly how old he said you know in um in the British formal school system if you act too happy people accuse you of being stupid mhm you to be to be gleeful or happy yeah um and I said now I would say Well they're perfectly fine being happy when they're drinking I will say that the afterwork um alcohol culture in lond 514 p.m. crowd they drink like I don't know if it's still the case but they drink a lot and then they get very like outwardly happy but there's this idea um and and this was true when I came into Academia um that if somebody wasn't super serious that they might be stupid um and I think in the United States now we tend to celebrate more expressions of Glee um but that's usually in the context of like celebrity and wealth yeah like these people getting on their private planes or something but I think there's still some elements to this that that we internalize that um if you're happy that you're not worrying about something if you're not worrying about something then you're ignoring the woes of the world maybe even the your the threats that are all around you and so we're some in some ways we are conditioned to always want to be happy that does seem to be one message but then we also get the conflicting message that to be happy is to be ignorant of what's really happening if not to you then to other people and therefore you're not fulfilling your role in society so who are you to be happy all the time there's a lot of judgment written into this thing around happiness I'm realizing yeah totally and and I think you're you're bringing up something that I actually worry about a lot right which is is that hypothesis correct is it the case that if you're feeling happy you just ignore the woes and all the terrible stuff in the world because then I'm creating like you know a whole generation of Yale students who are going to not fix the bad problems of life and so it turns out there's a researcher at Georgetown Constantine Kush who's tested this he actually asked the question you know is it the case that people who are experiencing more positive emotion more satisfaction with life do they ignore the problems of the world and not act or are they the ones kind of going out and doing stuff and so he did this in a couple different contexts he looked for social justice causes I'll tell the the climate version so he looked at how many people are taking climate action so do you go to a protest do you put solar panels on are you donating money to climate causes and he finds that the people who are really climate anxious they tend to have less positive emotions you're really worried about climate change you tend to be more on the depressed anxious side but if you're doing stuff about it then you tend to have more positive emotion um I think he assumes that Cal arrow goes in the other way that like if you're happier if you're experiencing lots of delights and positive emotion you kind of have the bandwidth to do stuff right you can go to that protest where if you're super depressed you're just going to like lie in bed with your duvet you don't have the bandwidth to do this stuff and so this old called kind of like poly enish hypo is about happiness it makes complete intuitive sense but if you look at the data it's actually the opposite which is a good thing because I think it gives us a mandate not to stay depressed about everything in the world pissed off about what's happening yes those negative emotions are good to to notice and experience and act on but like we can take care of ourselves and it's okay it doesn't mean we're going to stop doing good stuff in the world I have a family member she's wonderful she saves animals constantly um and she knows that she has an excessive number of animals um but she's from the East Coast from New Jersey and the other day she told me she goes you know I like your podcast but you know sometimes you have these guests on that are clearly from the west coast and you guys get into this real like West Coast California squishy stuff and I just can't listen to those and I said I won't say her name but um for sake of privacy but uh she said but you know I really like it when um even if the topic is about um something kind of uh squishy if the person's from the East Coast then like you know like I believe what they're saying and said and she goes yeah you know out there you're into this and that and I said well out there in New Jersey you know language is kind of a weapon she goes it's absolutely a weapon you know so I do think there are these even local cultural things like people from the Midwest to me I don't want to you know stereotype but they there's a every time I go to the the Midwest I must say there's a there's an etiquette people are just so polite and kind so the the level of of sort of mean level of decency is much higher than it is say in California in California there's some other things that are wonderful that are lacking elsewhere on the east coast and so forth but yeah I I think one can overgeneralize but I think that the reason I raised this is that maybe we all need to pay a little bit of attention to the messages that we internalized in our family and our culture growing up and ask ourselves whether or not our degree of happiness or lack thereof is you know by some programming yeah literally social programming that we've internalized cuz I I grew up in a home where um cynical humor was rewarded uhhuh and I've learned over the years in part um through discussions with Jim Zaki and and others like um I'm working on it uh not all my humor cynical but I don't like cynicism it bums me out it doesn't feel good and I realize it doesn't feel good I love Delight yeah but I don't like cynicism that's just me and for the cynics out there like cool do you do you but um I think we have to pay attention to kind of like where our set point is with this stuff cuz some people are like sitting real in the no push me and they want to be unhappy yeah right we're heading up on the holidays here so like Scrooge MH right and other people they're not feeling good they want to be happy and then other people really are just like no worries I mean down in Australia it's all no worries and what do they say in um Costa Rica I always oh uh Pur yeah which means it's like like the you good life you know chill life everyone was just telling each other like how great life should be all day long yeah yeah I mean I think you're getting at a really important issue right which is like do we have a happiness set point and kind of if we do where does it come from right in your example you know of kind of growing up cynically and having these kind of cynical messages it could be that that was some sort of you know maybe epigenetic thing right you're around all these people that are cynical and you learn how to do it right but it it could be more of the like genetic side maybe there's some pre-programmed you know sense of your negativity bias or something you know we don't have great answers to those things but it's definitely true that our place really shapes kind of a lot of our tendencies that matter for happiness um we know this from some of the like local kind of place things that you said I think you my my in-laws are from the Midwest and like yeah I toally they're just like great decent kind happy people they listening right now like I don't know you I'm trying to train to be like you they're wonderful um but but we also know from like even more macro level right so for now for decades the world happiness report in collaboration with the Gallup survey has been surveying happiness of people across the world right and they come up with these like really consistent country level differences in happiness um the US for a very wealthy country is like not very happy we're pretty low on the scale and in fact in the most recent World happiness report we dipped like below like the top 10 like we kind of had this major kind of dive for the first time who the happiest uh Scandinavians so it's usually Denmark I love going to Denmark yeah they're very very very happy so they tend to be happy and so we can ask the question what's the difference maybe it's you know the great Scandinavian genes probably not it's actually a lot of their cultural practices which build on the sorts of things talking about you know take social connection right there's um a lot less work hours so people can go home and hang out with their family there's a huge culture of clubs for example in Denmark where people go off and do sporting things a lot of Fitness right um and the structure is to kind of get that Fitness right like nobody expects you to be at work so you can go you know ski or work out or hang out I will say they're very effective when they work they're very proficient I mean I struck by the like average level of um operational and intellectual intelligence of somebody like the person your waiter in Denmark is an awesome waiter yeah like and often times has very interesting things to say like the level of proficiency and the level of focus when they are working is immensely high so they're not just like kicking back all day no and I and I think in part it's a different attitude towards work that there's a time for work but you don't let your work e kind of like leak into other things um there's this woman Helen Russell uh who wrote a book about the happiness in Denmark or the Danish path of happiness I think is the name of the book um and she had this quote of like she was talking to people in Denmark um and there's often a thing that will happen where your manager has to talk to you at work and give you feedback and it's in part because you're not leaving work on time you're there over time and they want to have a conversation with you like what's your problem why can't you finish your work in the aot at hours which again to American years is like what your manager would never say that I love it I love it but that's that's the social thing but but country level uh happiness is also affected by some of the thought patterns we talked about like the you know the Scandinavians even though like cold and dark and nothing like it's here in California with you right now they take joy in these tiny moments this idea of Huga right h y gge Hugo where you notice the warmth of your coffee or have these candles or things it's a it's a society that's really focused on presence in a really rich way I love that my like I said my father's Latin he's from Argentina and he married a Danish woman and and I would say much of their life is about um cherishing and delighting in these these these small things yeah um the everyday things yeah um I think that's dare I say I think that's one of their major points of convergence I know I'm sure there are others but that's a major point of convergence I think you know growing up in the United States I sort of internalized this idea that you know you're supposed to figure out who you know who you are and go do big things you know like um that was the message that I internalized part of that was the high school I went to a super competitive high school and um kind of people like tended to surround myself by but um yeah I think for some of us the effort is in trying to learn to appreciate the little things having a dog and I'm we have to talk about dogs because you you've actually studied dogs um extensively dogs non-human primates in in a natural setting and um and the other uh Old World primates humans um you know people talk about how dogs are just present they're not thinking about the past they're not thinking about the future I'd like to challenge that just for a second is theic in me this is the scientist in me and I'm genuinely curious how do we know that dogs aren't thinking a little bit about the past or the walk they're going to take later that afternoon do do we know I mean they have a prefrontal cortex that can anticipate things they have a memory system they have a hippocampus and a cortex that can remember things so how do we know that our dog isn't sitting there you know yes trying to glean as much Sunshine as they can on their belly through the through the uh through the window but maybe they're thinking like gosh like when are they going to finish doing what whatever it is they're doing so we can go outside and play ball yeah it's such a hard question it's such a hard question and I mean I think it's one that every dog owner has really wondered about right um I mean I've thought about this question actually more in the monkeys right who you know we can fight about dog neurobiology and they've got some of the stuff but like they're kind of distinct like tiny you know Walnut brains rather than like Prim dogs have I let's just say that well first of all dogs have as far as I know one of the most dramatic ranges in body size within a given uh species of animal so Chihuahua Great Dane I think it's the dosing of igf1 that regulates body size and dogs it's a beautiful cover of Science magazine that we can put a link to with a chahua and a Great Dane and it's just like whoa same species um but they have relatively small brains relative to their body weight size regardless and if you look at the what the brain's doing a lot of it is sensory I mean a lot of it's all Factory right it's not the ruminative thinking about stuff that we kind of have like expanded a lot in the primate brain you know not a lot of front prefrontal Cort lot of prefrontal stuff right before behind your forehead folks is this is the part that allows um you to say sh to your impulses to quiet your impulse suppress them and also um context dependent learning and planning so what to do what to say what not to do what not to say in a given environment there's a lot in your brain about that that is you know controlled by so-called executive function the sort of conductor of the whole thing and you're saying dogs dogs have a pretty limited real estate they're limited and if you think about what that real estate does you know it can kind of do that shush you know it can take you out of the moment but they're kind of related parts of you know kind of Cortex close by that's doing a lot of the work of thinking about past episodes thinking about what other people are thinking thinking about counterfactuals like not this is what humans are doing this is what humans are doing like the human big version of this right um and this is the kind of stuff that gets us into trouble when it comes to presents I think the dogs walking around it's like you know I don't know what it's sniffing like hydrant hydrant do you know like dog dog person person and I think it's there because it doesn't have as much circuitry to be like well this hydrant is not exactly as good as the other hydrant I smelled before like what would you know Bob the other dog be thinking of this hydrant right now I think or they're still laughing at so and so from the dog park incident two weeks ago right so much of human um negative interaction is like um humans exchanging good and bad information about other humans oh totally it's like kind of the basis of not all but a lot of social media yeah and a lot of our rumination is US thinking about the other information that people have about us right you know kind of we have no idea what exactly yeah and so you know I often think about this so in Buddhist circles um there's this discussion of the monkey Mind by which they mean the part of your mind that when you're trying to be present and focus on the moment especially in practices like meditation kind of runs off somewhere that's your monkey mind running off and you to kind of yank it back by the tail or something and I've always thought that was a real kind of unnecessary dis to monkeys because my sense is at least at least the Reese's monkeys which is the species I worked with they seem a lot more like dogs than humans you know I I work with this group of monkeys on a a field in a field site called Kaio Santiago it's this island off the coast of Puerto Rico and it's home to a thousand Freer ranging reesus monkey so we can do our studies and just kind of walk around with these monkeys who are kind of living freely and you see them and they just you know I'll sometimes sit near a monkey who's like sitting there looking out into the ocean and just sitting there and I'm like I bet what's going on in his head is not that human Buddhist version of the monkey mind where he's like what about this ocean when do I have to go home I have to cook something oh what did my husband say to me it's not that I think the monkeyy version is just like ocean ocean like it's just it's just there or even or even better like Costello I used to look at him and and think what's going on in that brain of his and then I realized it's probably and this is a neurophys I wouldn't consider myself a neurophysiologist but I've done some certainly a fair number of recordings from the the live brain and I'm guessing most of what was in there is what we call Hash not the drug back that's the sound on the Audio Monitor when's no clean signal toise I'm guessing just hash like I I wonder if the term monkey mind well here I'll just come clean I always thought that monkey mind was this image of a little monkey swinging from tree to tree and that it's the um adjective uh uh sort of superimposed on the human brain so excuse me it's the it's the verb of the of the moving monkey um transformed into an adjective um judgment about the human brain so so sad if you're a monkey like I think if monkeys had frontal cortex and talk to us would be like don't blame us for your like it's the human brain part of the brain that brain yeah exactly you know somebody who really appreciates Raptors and um diving birds think about the computations diving birds have to do they have to adjust for the refractory index of the water so where they see the fish is not where the fish is and um you know so when people say bird brain I'm like get me started on forid cognition those guys are the smartest yeah smartest guys so monkeys but but you're making me realize I always thought Reese's Maxs which are Old World primates like us or we're like them that they had a fair amount of prefrontal real estate in their brain such that they could think and strategize and plan I mean if one just watches one episode of that Netflix special which I love um which is chimp Empire mhm there's all this stuffff about who's in power and then they're going to team up and then they're going to wait a few days until that one's injured and then they're not going to groom the other one and boom there's an over I mean like very complicated it's chess not Checkers for for Old World primates yeah I think there could be a big distinction between what chimpanzees are doing I mean they're our closest you know tied with bonobo is our closest living relative you know that was what like 30 million you know like wasn't so long right whereas rees's monkeys are pretty far off right I think there could be a lot of things that happened um in between and and we know that not necessarily from the neurobiology because it's hard to ask kind of functional neurobiology questions with animals you can't kind of put them in fmri where they're doing Behavior as easily as you can with a human um but we know it from cognition studies that look at things like you know how good are say reesus monkeys at perspective taking at kind of taking on someone else's beliefs knowing oh somebody's thinking something theory of mind yeah thinking something different that I'm thinking um and they're not so hot at it they really use their own perspective to make judgments pretty well same thing when we look at cases of like counterfactual thinking you know do do you have regret over an outcome that you didn't get right something that reesus monkeys find kind of hard right so it seems like they're very good at sophisticatedly planning in the present moment right you know you and I are talking here right now if you're watching the video you can see I have a cup like I might be planning to pick up the cup right but the cups here everything I'm not simulating what if this was a lovely martini right that that's the kind of thing that probably a human can do really well but a monkey can't so they can kind of plan and take Next Step actions when there's around the world that they experience but they can't simulate worlds that are totally different and that includes the kind of complicated stuff going on in somebody else's head so they're good at short-term strategy this fits with um what a friend of mine who studies behavior in macx told me which is that you can set up a really nice complicated onp paper perfect experiment where the monkey is going to inform you about some important feature of how the brain works in terms of Behavioral economics or something but then what you realize is or what the monkey realizes even if it doesn't consciously realize is that no matter what they're going to get reward 50% of the time on average and they'll just hit the lever or give an answer as fast as they can so they get that day's ration of reward and just that's the end of the day and so they're not cheating they're just like why would I work any harder than this to actually do the experiment you want me to do and so what many primate behavioral researchers end up becoming are monkey trainers oh yeah I mean the bane of every animal researcher existence this is whether you test dogs monkeys rodents whatever is what are called side biases what's a side bias it's you're giving an animal a choice between A and B one A's on the left B's on the right and rather than think through these complicated things you want them to Think Through they're just like whatever hey left I'll go left left left left left left and you're like no I know you get rewarded 50% of the time but I had this really creative question I wanted you to pay attention and they just don't care they don't care well they're or or or they're getting rewarded enough at 50% that you have to do something like what what researchers in the FI I mean now we're getting really in the trenches called breaking a side bias we're like no I'm going to give more reward at B if you're only going to left then I'm going to give more reward at right we move them and stuff but it does often seem to be the case that the monkeys are training us more than we trading the monkeys so I Delight in that a little bit I confess just a little bit just a tiny bit um I mean I I'll I'll share one story that that kind of gets it you know this sort of perspective taking how good they are that they are good when it's kind of what's in the here and now right um we were doing these studies um on the island which involved was showing monkeys some food and we had these these eggplants in a box that we were making the monkeys look at for various reasons we couldn't find a monkey to test on this island you have to kind of hike around until you find a monkey who's kind of chilled out and whatever and we had hiked around the whole Mount the whole island it was taking forever we get back to our starting location and there's there's an eggplant that's sitting there we're like where' that where' that eggplant come from and we're like and it's got like bite marks out of it we're like how did that and it was like wait a minute somebody must have stolen my eggplant and we're like well how did that happen like we were like we were paying attention to the monkeys the whole time we realized like no no no they must have stolen it when we were like we probably put it down for a second and like they took it like we didn't drop it it was like and so it was like we iiz like oh not only are they good at stealing but they can tell like if we're looking at it but looking is something that you know all animals pay attention to gaze like you know this is the kind of thing that even you know insects pay attention to right that's why they have these kind of markings that look like eyes so that birds won't eat them and stuff gaze following is really robust but that's different than that monkey thinking I bet that person's not looking it's probably like no eyes I can grab it right but if you look kind of more sophisticatedly they're not good at it but this was another case of realizing like oh the monkeys are actually a lot smarter than than we give them credit for and maybe us too yeah so what we're talking about is they are good at um figuring out the basic rules MH maybe even up to the level of what you call in computer programming and Gates if this and that are happening then I go right if that and that are not happening then I don't do anything and if that and a third option are happening well then I go left yeah um and if all three are happening it doesn't matter like they can probably figure out you know two or three levels of and Gates but what they can do is simulate all these various situations I mean the amazing thing about being a human is I could you know I could imagine any scenario imagine like 700 podcast listeners jumped on this table right now you know imagine if the table was orange like imagine if you were I don't know another podcaster you're Malcolm Gladwell or whatever like I more hair true I mean I can simulate all these infinite different things to try to program that so hard but it comes to us as humans in seconds it's so fast and it's the kind of thing that we use all the time honestly it's it's the basis of a lot of our happiness look at you know the fiction that we engage in right you we're constantly paying deep and close attention to fictional worlds I've cared more about some fictional worlds than I've cared about my own family members sorry family members but it's true right like you're reading a novel and you're like I'm crying I'm balling I'm cheering for these people that I know are completely made up because our brains just kind of dive into into these sort of fake worlds these alternative worlds so easily and so quickly so powerfully I definitely want to continue along the dimension of how we construct our happiness but I just want to make sure that I ask again about dogs um and and you know let's let's just do this because you know I know it's so politically dangerous but let's talk about the dog versus cat thing yeah you know my sister loves cats I don't dislike cats but that doesn't mean I like them I once rented a place where there was a big cat I think it was one of these manun cats his name was Baloo they're basically do he's basically a dog and Costello had certain cat-like qualities like he just wanted to Lounge all day he could really move like a dog but most of the time he was kind of like a cat at home and it was frustrating for me but I mean what do what do you think it is you know you have these feline people and you have dog people and I'm definitely in the dog camp but one of the reasons I love dogs is I assume they're in the Pres but mostly it's the unconditional love but what do you think it is this dog cat thing I mean cats are presumably in the present as well yeah um they don't make long-term plans and if they do they don't actualize those plans so why is it that some people feel that cats are like nasty animals that are plotting against them and some people Delight in cats yeah they don't have great data on it but my sense is it gets back to the unconditional love idea the cat like if you're the kind of person who craves the unconditional love you wind up being more of a dog person yes but if you like the what was it that your your uh was it your niece yeah my niece yeah what was it your niece said this like no push meat she used to hold her finger up yeah like say going cats are a lot more no push me unless we said we were going for ice cream it was no push me and I remember and I still Delight in it thinking like awesome she had just I mean like she had such a strong Spirit from the time she you might like cats cuz cats are a lot like no push me and I think I think this is that I don't want a cat well I think I think the like removal of the sort of no push me might be one of the last stages of evolution and domestication of dogs and I know this because in my dog work we also did some very fun work with dingos which are the Australian wild dogs and we don't fully know their history our sense is like those dogs kind of like got pretty close to humans pretty tolerant of humans but didn't go like all the way to Costello in terms of the bond um and one of the amazing things we get interacted with this group at a sanctuary for dingo out in Australia um one of the only sets of genetic pure dingos in the world with this wonderful privilege to work with but we kind of had to like do our keep at these field stations so we kind of went in and you know helped cleaned up with the dingo and so on and uh every morning you'd go out and you'd give the dingo their food which are these big kind of chickens um and they would just I mean they just kind of raw chickens not live chickens but they'd just like Chomp it in one gulp just like bones and all and you're like whoa and then right after that they'd want to be kind of oh come on nudge me be nice it was like a cat in its best move but then at a certain point they were just like like no like I'll stop they just had like such their own will in this really amazing way and it just felt incredibly catlike I'm like you look like a dog but your behavior is so much more cat-like so so I don't know no great studies on this it'd be great to kind of figure it out but my sense is distinction between dog people and Cat people might be the unconditional love no push me ratio of what people like so interesting and um I like to think did not take us too far off course in our discussion about happiness because we clearly Delight in this and y people do too is that we think about the different the different brain architectures and the different capabilities the different brain architectures have across species um and the fact that we live in such close proximity to some of these species is wild when I was growing up not everyone had a dog unless they had the space for it now I feel like dogs are everywhere yeah I mean it's like such an enormous billion dollar industry to have dogs and it raises a question that kind of gets us back to some of the happiness work like which is is that a good idea right all these people are investing their time their energy their space and dogs you know you could ask the question do they make us happier and I know you they do yeah don't I'm not going to break everybody's heart we've killed the cat people and the dog no pet dogs in particular but pets in general um wind up making us happier pet owners are statistically happier um and I think it's for a couple of reasons based on the stuff we just talked about you know take the behavioral pattern that matters social connection for sure dogs provide that social connection themselves you know we just talked about they tap into your caregiving system and so on but as you talked about in your interactions with like you know Bulldog pleading you know like Bulldog you know what was the phrase you used when you see a bulldog and you say Bulldog something oh I when I see somebody with a bulldog I just say um excuse me there's a bulldog tax and then I and then I pet their Bulldog good let me go if you're going to meet a bulldog just understand they're they're shaped like a beer keg so they can't scratch themselves on their on their hind quarters so if you give them a scratch there they're like thank you because it's got to be a just awful it's like having that scratch in the middle of your back and you can't reach it so you do you you do the Bulldog text and you have this nice social connection with the Bulldog but my guess is and because you're using verbal language you also connected with the person you probably say oh my gosh what's his name oh when did you get him blah blah blah that's chatting with the briest at the coffee shop right that's doing the you know Nick ebl experiments we just talked about before pets wind up bringing us social connection um and one of the pieces of advice if you're feeling lonely is get an animal not just so that the animal will give you some comfort but you know it's particularly with a dog you got to walk that animal and then people talk to you it's much easier to connect with people when you have dogs so social connection is huge um second thing is you know particularly again for dogs um what are people doing they're getting out and walking right so we're getting some people who never had a lot of physical exercise before are at least getting the kind of walks they need to do in for the dog and even if they won't choose to do it for themselves they often choose to do it for their dog so you get you know exercise in which is good for physical health and we haven't talked about but is enormously good for happiness meta analyses showing you know half hour of cardio exercise exercise a day is as good as a anti-depression medication for reducing symptoms of depression so just that walk with your dog is great but beyond that I think they help our thought patterns right and this is true for dogs I think and cats right where you know as you're were saying we're wondering what they're doing sometimes if they're sitting there and we're just petting them what we're doing is we're sitting there and we're petting them so they give us these wonderful sensory experiences and I think they cause us to be a little bit more present especially when we're kind of interacting with them you know we're interacting with our dogs unless you're taking the Instagram pictures of the dog but usually when you're playing with the dog or what ever it's you're just there you're not on your phone you're just kind of mindfully experiencing life with your dog kind of like when you talked about your road trip you know part of what probably brought you into the present moment especially if your girlfriend was working was like that the dog was interacting with you so the dogs help us not because they're inherently kind of Happiness inducing they help us take these boxes of better behaviors for happiness better thought patterns for happiness and they're kind of a delight so they kind of give us some positive emotion too I love all of that I just want to um double click uh if it were on this idea that they can be a bridge for social connection that's really powerful a friend of mine who used to smoke cigarettes who doesn't any longer um in fact I remember when I was a postto at Stanford that like the mostly the foreign post talks but they used to gather outside and have Cigar cigarette breaks all the time now you're not allowed to smoke on the medical school campus and I think probably on the main campus too most places you're not allowed to smoke out right because of secondhand smoke any any in any case but um but he said to me you know it used to be that um before people either knew or fully internalized how bad smoking was is that asking for a cigarette or sharing a cigarette side by side with somebody was a way that people engaged in casual interaction not just outside of bars not just to meet potential mates Etc but it was just it was a bridge you know you can walk up to somebody and say you know like we call it like buming a smoke like you ask for a cigarette or you if someone was smoking you could go stand by them and also smoke yeah and so is this terribly Health diminishing habit but it served as a lot of social lubricant yeah it also it also gives you another behavior that we know is really important for happiness which is time um there's a lot of social science research on this phenomena that's called time affluence which is a sort of subjective sense that you feel wealthy in time you kind of just have a break right you get a like a smoking break is one of these right you get a break and often people you know back in the day when smoking was allowed one of the ways that you got your breakes often in not so great workplaces was like you could ask for a smoke break my mom talks about this she was a a teacher educator for a super long time where you don't get a lot of breaks but you know back in the 70s if you're a smoker they'd let you go outside for 10 minutes and that was a sort of break right so I think this other unhealthy habit kind of gave us the opportunity to take breaks which we know are great for happiness and so great for happiness that if you don't have any of this so-called time affluence is sense that you have some free time if you experience what researchers called time famine where you feel like almost starving for time it's a huge hit on your well-being if you self-report these surveys being time famished so I don't have time to meet up with my friends I never have time for the stuff I want to do that's as big a hit on your well-being as if you self-report being unemployed you know listeners if you lost you have a job and you lost it tomorrow you'd probably think of that as a big hit in your happiness just not having any time for the little breaks in life is as bad wow and this gets back to our earlier discussion about money and happiness which is researcher Ashley willins at Harvard Business School has kind of pushed the idea that what's going on with these you know low income folks who have a real hit on happiness right not having a high income hurt your happiness her theory is a lot of that actually has to do with time because if you have a really low income you don't have a car to get to work so you're taking the bus and it's taking you forever you're working multiple jobs right that a lot of the reason that money affects happiness and not having money affects happiness is that it co-varies with not having time and the real hit on our happiness is just the time part more so than the money part so we need to be in pursuit of things we need to work um but we also need some free time we can't have too much free time or too much work basically and The Sweet Spot is often hard to maintain or even know what what that sweet spot is yeah I think this this term kind of time affence and what researchers mean by is helpful here right it's the subjective sense that you have some free time it's not I objectively go into your calendar and you show me how many open blocks there are it's your sense that you have a break and this provides an interesting hack that we can use to get more of it right which is that we can kind of just frame things as is having more time um you know cuz sometimes when you get a break that you don't expect it can feel like a lot um I teach this uh class about happiness on y's campus and I talk about time affluence it's one of the topics in my class and I always felt that was really ironic because our young people today especially at you know Elite College institutions are so time famished they're running from thing to thing and have a million extracurriculars and so on so I feel will like I'm going to lecture them for an hour on time affluence and tell them all these studies and so what I did was uh they in the syllabus as said there's a lecture on time affluence and they come to class and I have my teaching assistants that are handing out little Flyers that say today's you know like lectures about time affluence and to teach you what that is I'm going to give you some no class today so you didn't know you walked to class now you got a free hour and a half and it just happened to be one of these unusually warm you know like California esque days in New Haven where it was like sunny out so kids you know got a bubble tea with their friend or some of them went on a hike near the like local you know State Park and one of the students I remember burst in a tear is when she got this this form and she said uh this is the first free hour and a half I've had for like the last three months you know wow um that stress they're that stress but what I find interesting about this is like I didn't give them a month off vacation right I gave them an hour back unexpectedly and it felt like it was huge and Andrew I don't know your schedule but sometimes my schedule can be so overwhelmed and so packed that you know there's a half hour meeting that gets canceled I'm just like and like their relief I feel like I could learn a new language I could you know like you just feel like but it's a half hour right and I think this is a hack we can use for ourselves right you know listeners right now go on your calendar a few months from now and just like you know take like you know months months away pick an hour period and just write in like huberman lab time affluence and just don't put anything in that and my guess is when you get to that hour that you've scheduled months later you'll be like oh my gosh this feels great we can kind of gift ourselves these little Windows of time um another hack we can do is to make good use of the free time we do have and this is kind of a puzzle is something that I found unexpected when I saw the data on this which is that turns out we actually have more free time now than we did like 10 15 years ago if you add it up not just kind of postco but in general we've been getting more free time however the free time we have is cut up differently it's in smaller chunks it's like five minutes when that Zoom meeting ends a little earlier 10 minutes if your kid falls asleep early or whatever it is and we don't think it's that much so we just kind of blow it but if you add it up it winds up more than people in past decades have had and probably like good time that we could use for stuff and so these little chunks of time are what the journalist Bridget schul calls time confetti which I think is such a great image of it it's this little you know five minutes here and there but you can do a lot with those minutes if you add them up um we just have to use them a little bit more intentionally right and that could be you know for some of the stuff you talk about in this podcast a lot like use that t you do the seven minute New York Times workout you know do do the kinds of things we're talking about you know that's the time you text your friend and have a delay or get some sunlight get some sunlight outside right walk in sunlight huge problem is what do we do when we get the time confetti or I mean what do I do when I'm in a bad moment pull out our phone check our email scroll through it's like again this sort of neutr sweet dopamine hit that's not being effective so if you feel really overwhelmed and you objectively don't have a lot of time remember that the time confetti that you already have it's already sitting there can be really valuable if you use it well super important um because I think the filling of those spaces with what I love the analogy to neutr or artificial sweeteners is it's going to taste like it's providing some sort of nourishment but it's um probably just creating a more sense of craving and want at some level would really like to talk about reward circuitry just thematically um listeners of this podcast and even if they've never heard one of these podcasts before um probably familiar with the word dopamine we've talked about it a bit and as we were talking about earlier everything about the dopamine reward circuitry which of course includes other chemicals too is based on prior experience relative to current experience relative to anticipated outcom what sometimes referred to as reward prediction error think something Great's going to happen something great happens great think something Great's going to happen something less than great happens sucks way more Yep than you would anticipate think that something not so great is going to happen something so so great happens huge reward not novelty surprise brings the positive novelty and and surprise brings the biggest rewards and this is what I would like to kind of paint as the backdrop think about it as a conceptual mural behind us as I asked the question maybe just maybe we're not supposed to be happy all the time or maybe even all that often mhm and when we're feeling not so great or even lousy ided it's not dangerous levels of depression maybe we should frame that as the backdrop for the greater happiness that will come when we start to emerge from that lousy State yeah now some people could say well now you're just kind of using neurobiology to you know twist around what would otherwise be a lousy experience and tell me that it's good for me no uh what I'm trying to say is you know people want to be happy I think we'd all love to be happy all the time but we're not wired to be happy all the time and maybe the feelings of Happiness can't exist unless they have contrast with these neutral or negative emotion states that we call I don't know feeling lousy feeling anxious Etc and just I realize I can pose long questions but I just want to provide a little bit more context for the moment which is that every circuit in the brain our ability to see light literally depends on the contrast with the so-called off circuitry which is the circuitry in our visual system that perceives dark we need contrast to be able to see light mhm everything's Push Pull hunger satiety cold heat perception um go no go it's all Push Pull circuitry in there why wouldn't happiness have a pushpull relationship with unhappiness or at least neutral affect yeah well I think it does I mean you're giving a neurobiological explanation for what psychologists in this field of positive psychology have referred to is what's called hedonic adaptation is a fancy way of saying we get used to stuff um you know you like grab the you know delicious ice cream cone I know we Hub we do a delicious salad really healthy but it's tasty healthy tasty salad right start eating it first bite is like this is awesome I'm so into it it's great bite number two a little bit less awesome little bit less by the 10th bite it's not because you're full or you're like you know feeling disgusted it's just like that sensory experience you've gotten used to it right it's just no longer as interesting walk into a bakery yeah exactly it smells amazing spend 5 minutes in the bakery 10 minutes in the bakery you attenuate you habituate which is great I mean you wouldn't maybe want to be firing your your neurons would get all exhausted and stuff but it's in in one way terrible for happiness in another way very good for happiness but in a major way terrible for happiness which is the following every good thing in life if it sticks around becomes kind of boring over time you just kind of used to it um I use the example sometimes of you know the last time the first time your partner said I love you or if you had a kid the first time your kid said mommy or daddy that feels amazing right but like you know last week my husband said I love you it's like whatever I'm just used to it right you know last week when your kid was like I love you mom like you know Mommy like you don't care right the most amazing thing in life if it gets repeated just becomes boring and that sucks because you know you like the most amazing things in life to kind of keep being awesome it's pretty sad that we don't have it right this has a lip side though which is very good for happiness hedonic adaptation which is the most terrible thing in life can happen and over time you get used to that too you know so your partner breaks up with you um you find out you have a chronic disease right just something like really bad happens day one when you find out that piece of information it is awful but day two yeah still awful but that's just your life and then over time it kind of gets better um a very famous study in the field of Happiness science that tried to look at this with um people who experienced a really great event in theory uh winning the lottery um and people who experienced really bad events real events in life um becoming paraplegic so you used to be able to walk and now you've lost the use of your legs you survey happiness um in people who haven't had these experiences and you ask predict how bad it would be to have this and people say you know a day one of winning the lottery would be really great and you know a year from now a year from that point winning lottery would still be just as great it'd be awesome same thing with paraplegic you know you're you know moment you become paraplegic that day is a really crappy Thursday but a year from then is still just as crappy and what you find is people you know on the day you become paraplegic or the day you win your lottery like that a big shift in your contrast right you know the day you win the lottery is an awesome Thursday day you become paraplegic is terrible but a year from then it turns out your happiness is no different from baseline from the day before that event happened right statistically um and that is shocking right like I know these results I can quote the paper but like if you told me today laori you you know you walk out of Studio you get hit by a car your paraplegic how would you feel in 2026 I'd be like my life is still really crummy um but statistically that's just not going to happen what does that mean that's kind of good news about hedonic adaptation for happiness that means the worst thing possible could happen to you and you have all these processes that are just going to get used to it over time and it's going to be okay and I think this is an important aspect of our psychology that we forget I think sometimes we have opportunities to do things in life that are a little risky something we might try out that we might screw up or fail at or that we'll be bad at at first and we don't do it because we're scared we're making a prediction like oh well if I failed or if I screwed that up you know I'd just be unhappy but actually all these mechanisms that we have of hedonic adaptation means those things aren't going to affect you for as long as you think so I think the contrast hypothesis about happiness is real um good things don't stay good things over time um but the bad things don't either and so but we still want the good things to stay good over time and so that raises a question of of how we can do that um and Liz Dunn whose work I've mentioned before she likes to use this phrase that scarcity Engineers happiness right um one thing we can do is space out the good things in life you know so if I was having that really delicious healthy salad with the avocado whatever if I had that every day it would stop being good um but if I had it very very infrequently it would still be good every time I come back to it and so some some sometimes oddly the way we make ourselves happier is to kind of remove positive experiences especially extreme positive experiences um kind of space them out so we can kind of come back to them over time I definitely agree with that I also and forgive me folks but I think I understand why um dogs are so awesome they don't attenuate to reward MH you tell them they're going to get this little piece of amazing whatever beef jerky or something and they like yes then second trial yes third trial yes I mean presumably at some point they reached satiety or fatigue but there's something about their reward Pathways that they don't seem to attenuate much and there's a if there's feedback to us on that it's like okay okay you know it's great that they'll keep um delighting in the simple little things it seems like almost as much as the the first time yeah we are not like that it's interesting no to my knowledge people haven't studied honic adaptation in dogs but it's a really good question but but we are not like that for most things um and this is this this sucks right I mean it's also the case that in addition to kind of getting used to stuff over time um it's also showing a different feature which is sort more particular contrast feature you're talking about so we over time we kind of habituate that's one sort of neural mechanism but another is the one that you mentioned which is about the contrast right and that's what you see kind of you see both of them say in the light perception right if I show you the same light over time you're going to habituate that's Hedon literally for folks listening uh it literally disappears yes if I set up the right experiment um Russ and Karen dallo at Berkeley years ago did these beautiful experiments you you look at like a grading of light projected onto a wall and if you can stabilize the eyes so that they're not moving around the it literally will disappear and same thing with an odor same thing with touch right like I wasn't thinking about my contact happiness my delicious habituation attenuation these These are technical terms when you really get down into it and the push pull antagonism between um light and dark this smell yes no on off push all of it Go noo every single aspect of the nervous system functions this way flexor flexor extensor in the muscle skeletal system but that gets to maybe what I would think of as different so hedonic adaptation is the same stimulus over time like almost like habituation there's a different thing that happens when you get what you might call a contrast um and there's all kinds of visual illusions that sort of function on this if you've ever seen the one where it's like you is it the same color over here over here we throw this on your show page to show people and it's like oh it looks different it's like no no no that's because of the the kind of contrast between the two things you see something that's really bright over here it makes something else look a little darker right um that's a different negative effect on our happiness a lot of the time this is the comparison effect right this is like you know my $50 million seems kind of crappy because I hang out with people who you know have hundred million doar objectively have a tremendous amount of money but I feel bad because I'm kind of comparing against something else and so often time when we're evaluating different rewards we're kind of comparing them against what other people had or what we've had in the past and that means that being in an objectively good situation might feel really crappy if you just have somebody else that has a slightly better objectively good situation my favorite example of this actually comes from the Sports World um so researchers asked this interesting question like how happy are you when you win an Olympic medal right you're on the stand you won an Olympic medal and also who's happiest so gold medalist is up there best in the world you might assume they're the happiest right and they are they're smiling reseearch is anal this by looking at facial expressions and kind of code the muscles and so on but turns out they're not the happiest right who's the happiest well let's look at the silver Metalist are they happiest No in fact actually if you code their facial muscles they're showing expressions like contempt deep sadness is the same expression you'd make like if your parent died or like you know a real terrible grief moment this is the I don't adhere to this but this is the quote unquote second placees first loser yeah kind of mindset because the idea is like you know who's your major comparison point if you're in silver you know 2 seconds or something you would have gotten gold and you're not feeling objectively like you're the second best on the planet you beat you know but all but one of a billions of people on the planet no you just feel terrible so that's silver medalist what's going on with the bronze medalist right there's another person on this stand what's their comparison point it's not gold they were multiple people multiple seconds away their Salient comparison is like by the grace of God like I'm up here at all I almost like you know two seconds the other direction I would have never gotten up here and when you analyze the bronze medalist facial expressions they're sometimes even happier than the gold medalist definitely happier than the silver who's objectively better but sometimes even happier than the gold medalist because they're like oh relative to my comparison point I'm doing amazing and the gold medalist is expected to get gold the next year or else it's pure reward prediction error um especially if they internalize the expectations of the audience the The Spectators excuse me um because if they come back the next year and they're second or third on the podium or not on the podium it's seen as falling from a higher place exactly this is a point that I make with my IV League students who've been perfect in their grades and perfect at everything to get into a place like Yale which is like turns out that's a terrible recipe for happiness The Only Way Forward is stay stay there down or create a new stay there you don't notice right because you're habituated to it just like the pattern down feels really bad like that's a terrible comparison um I often play my students that DJ College song All I do is win all I do is win win win and I was like all you do is win win win would be a Terri terrible way to experience success in life because you just stop noticing it over time if you won and that's messed up because it means when you get when you finally hit the success that you were striving for if you just stay at that level just stops being good which sucks and so that raises a different question which is like what is a hack that we can do to get away from that um one is to not look for the Silver Lining but to look for the bronze lining which is you know you kind of think of reference points that are lower than your I love a good conceptual F especially when it's framed in an experiment so thank you for that yeah like science experiment yes so look for the bronze linting which means find a reference point that's not as good and for most of the things you're comparing whether that's your looks your Fitness level your finances you can look and find somebody that's doing worse than you um another great hack for this and this is more one that's a kind of a hack for honic adaptation getting used to stuff um actually comes from the ancient Traditions I you talk a lot about you know smart you know folks back in the day who came up with this stuff right this is one from the stoic tradition a practice called negative visualization so stoics like Marcus are really a thought when you wake up in the morning you should have the following thought pattern you should think today I will lose my success I will be exiled I'll lose my partner I will lose my health I won't be able to walk he doesn't say ruminate on that for forever but just like a little and then stop and say h I'm not exiled I still have my success I still have my partner and so on this is a technique called negative visualization um where you just imagine you don't have to live it in real life you just imagine you lose something um if you've ever lost something you're hedonically adapted to you know how quickly you recognize the value of it this happens to me with my phone all the time I'm a chronic phone loser and I'm like you know and I'm like oh my God my phone is gone I left it in the airport all my contacts are there and then I'm like oh it's in the car you have this I love my phone like it's so line in pul fiction where he says like um what is it it's like it's um finding at some point I think it was Travolta says something someone will know it where you know uh finding finding it almost made uh losing it worth it exactly like because you you appreciate it in a way that you didn't before because it was taken away from you and that sucks to really lose your phone sometimes in my case you really lost the phone right but negative visualization you don't have to do that you just use your imagination right and so uh if you're listening right now and you have a kid um let's do this negative visualization the last time you saw your kid was the last time you ever saw them never going to see them again no didn't happen you don't have to room about it but my guess is the next time you hug your kid you'll hug just just that two seconds of thinking about what things would be like without it can break through hedonic adaptation so one of my favorite hacks for hedonic adaptation you can use scarcity really space things out but for the things you can't space out you can't like have a kid and get rid of a kid for two weeks and come back to your kid right you can use your imagination and it doesn't take much to start to realize what you have and appreciate it more so I love this one mostly because I I think most people including myself really U we want to avoid thinking negative stuff especially on purpose but what you're telling us is that it provides a a wonderful contrast point to kind of trampoline off into the reality that is our current reality Which is far better than the these horrible scenarios and I think this gets to you know another domain in which I see kind of toxic positivity playing out a lot which is kind of in this sort of doain of like you know how do we do this stuff better right like how do we you know kind of get good things in life and there's a lot of talk in some circles about this idea of like manifesting right I'll just think about you know I'm feeling lonely I'll just think about what it's like to have friends or I'm not fit right now just imagine you know my FIT future and fantasize about what it's like to you know run marathons and things like that um turns out this can have like a this can be a case where you're using imagination in a bad way because what happens when you really deeply imagine say the rewards of like being super fit you start to get like your brain's like firing the reward cylinders for like what it feels like to be super fit and there's evidence from Gabrielle Ting's Lab at NYU that like you actually get less motivated to do stuff she does this in the context of Fitness she is people who you know want to run a 5k or want to lose some weight for example they talk about like you know imagine how great it would be to do this and they're less motivated to put on their running shoes in practice because they've already imagined the fantasy future turns out instead of manifesting a better technique if you have some habit that you want to engage in is to imagine the obstacles the bad stuff that's coming up right so oh I want to get out and run this 5K what's the obstacle to that I'm going to be in bed alarm's going to go off what's going to happen like oh I'm going to be you know too warm like maybe I put my running clothes on or oh like I'm not going to want to it's going to be cold out like oh I should get a nice you know fuzzy hat to be able to do this this O's work shows that if you actually imagine the negative things again not ruminating about him freaking out but imagine particularly the obstacles for a habit you want to engage in um you kind of naturally come up with solutions to those obstacles which makes it easier so sometimes times thinking about the bad stuff can be helpful we just have to regulate when we do it I have a friend who's a cardiologist from UCSF and he says you know the danger of telling people that you're going to write a book or that you're going to start a podcast or that you're going to start a company is that if you have very supportive friends and if you tend to be a pretty high agency person you'll get a lot of praise and a lot of reward and there's a lower probability that you'll actually do the thing because you've derived some of the reward whereas if people tell you you know yeah that seems kind of unlikely given that this and that you know it feels um doesn't feel so good and obviously we we want to encourage each other this is the complicated thing it's you know it's a it's a it's a very narrow beam to walk on you want to encourage people but you don't want to give them so much reward that then it undercuts their their motivation and you certainly don't want to discourage them to the point where they give up on themselves prior to even trying that's right but you know at least in the United States probably in other countries too goodness do we love a story about somebody who was told like they couldn't do it and they did it you know I think about the about the enormous popularity of David goggin it was you know had a truly difficult childhood and internalized all these messages of how terrible he was and um and then used those voices other people's and his own in his head to push himself to do tremendously difficult things and then to continue to do tremendously difficult things and to self-publish one of the most you know popular self-published books of all time and then to go off and become a a medic and now he's effectively doing the training of somebody going to medical school for his new train like he just refuses to stop um and it's according to him sat in that very chair and said it's fueled by an internal voice of you of you can't do it and then he fights back against that voice which is Oho different than manifesting this image of success exactly and and and there's again this is a case where there's Nuance you have to believe it's possible Right those negative voices can't tell you it's impossible because something else we know about motivation is that believing something is possible um which requires lots of effort but it is possible is quite helpful for you um the best example of this comes from another sort of sporting case uh I don't if you know the case of Roger banister who's the first guy to run the for minute mile break the four break the 4 minute mile um and before he did that people thought it was like physiologically impossible like the human body cannot do this and he was like no if human body can do this everyone was like Roger you're crazy whatever but then he you know trained and trained and probably to overcome his obstacles he ran it and then within like two months somebody else broke the 4minute mile like it had not been broken in all of human history but as soon as people had evidence of like oh people can do that like now everybody does it and now I don't know I mean I'm as you can see not a fit person but like lots of people run four minute miles it's not like the huge thing high schoolers run it yeah which is crazy I mean but the point is that they're falling they're probably helped out by this thing called the banister effect like they know it's possible right so like if you train if you run into obstacles if you don't get that time you're like well I guess it's you know physiologically I just can't do it you can kind of do it and so so there there's this idea with the banister effect you kind of have to be optimistic enough to think that it's doable but when you think that it's doable it's really helpful to ask the question okay what are the things that are going to come in the way of my doing it you imagine them really kind of vividly so you get a sense um it can super help it one of the things that contrasts a country like Denmark for instance um compared to the United States um and I know this from discussions with my stepmothers that you know in this country we have this notion because we have a lot of examples of people that went from absolutely nothing to these uh tremendously quote unquote high places financially reputationally Etc performance in whatever domain um sometimes overnight um you know this last year I would say uh two events stick out in my mind as like whoa like wow um the first was seeing um the SpaceX um rocket get get captured by the quote unquote Chopsticks that was just a rocket Landing of all things as it was so cool everybody regardless of what else was going on with you know people's opinions of of uh SpaceX or Elon or whatever we're just like whoa that was just an awesome feat of engineering just undeniably awesome feat of engineering so it sets a um an up a bigger upper ceiling on what we thought was possible we're seeing something that we hadn't seen before um at least not like that not at that scale resolution so that changes what one conceptualize about what's possible at in different aspects of life and um and I think that's important it lifts the ceiling the other was um very different example was the overnight um the Haka girl right who nobody knew of right made a comment in a passing um you know video on the street you know one of these like whatever spontaneous interview things and then now has a quite successful podcast it was ranked one of the highest um new podcast of the year um has a as far as I understand has a a staff and a thriving business now and like you know took you know this is a very American thing right to go from an unknown to one or two quick comments to all of a sudden um being a famous and presumably famous and somewhat wealthy person as well and um you know wish her nothing but luck and in evolving that her show yeah good good luck yeah sure like I I I love to see people win you know like okay it it was an unusual trajectory but but not so unusual for the United States in some sense because we also have the people who you know climb the staircase or the people that climb the staircase fell then came back you know we we love and we um cherish these stories um in this country and I think it I think it frames the the young mind in an interesting way it sets this anything is possible often times it takes clearly a ton of hard work often times at the expense of other aspects of one's mental or or life you know um Life Enrichment Family Etc but it's a very American thing for people to be like anything's possible yeah what do you think that does to our level of Happiness if we're somebody that you know is looking for happiness wants a good life wants resources but doesn't um like she maybe they feel a little guilty that they're not as quote unquote ambitious as everybody else but then you contrast that with a country like Denmark where people are very happy they're certainly Ambi ambitious Danes but they're actually I was told that the word ambition has is a little little bit of a pejorative little bit because you're not supposed to you know it's a very um you're not supposed to get that far ahead of anybody without acknowledging that you're still part of the pack um forgive me Danes but um they're nice people so they'll likely go easy on me and I have Danish relatives so like how do we how do we take what's out and around us address who we are and reconcile those things so that we're we're good with what we've got and know that we are good with what we've got yeah yeah I mean I think this is a spot where you know culture plays a big role I think you're exactly right about Denmark in fact the Dan have this idea of Jon's law I'm probably pronouncing this poorly but JN te's law which is idea is like you're aren't really supposed to be better than anybody else or like kind of showing off or like pushing yourself or thinking you're better even kind of maybe striving specific not to be you can strive to be better but to strive to be better than other people it's kind of it's like a no no it's sort of culturally frowned upon um in this way that I think is completely the opposite in the US right now where like that's seen as an awesome thing um I think the problem is that these kind of rags to Rich's stories um you know you you've given cases of like ones that there's like a moment right in SpaceX they do this wonderful thing you're like yeah they kind of got there and you know Haku is still doing her thing but there was this moment of like oh my gosh she kind of achieved this success there's this idea that we kind of think that there's a end destination for something um you know I'm going to you know get $50 million I'm going to get married or I'm going to get that promotion at work right my for my students I'm going to get into like a really Elite college or something like that um we don't put our emphasis on the Journey part we put our emphasis on the destination part and we assume that the destination is going to come with a lot of Happiness um this is a bias that researchers have called the arrival fallacy I'll be happy when you know it's almost like the happily ever after I'll be happily ever after if I get that promotion or happily ever after when I meet that person and what we know from hedonic adaptation is that thing that's awesome in the moment when you arrive there quickly becomes the other thing um you mentioned briefly the gold medalists who have this moment where it's like they won the gold medal and that's awesome but now everything else is downhill or I just got to do it again right we we arrive at the best possible place we could have fantasized and instantly it's like I just have to start chasing the next carrot so sometimes when we find ourselves I think as Americans you know chasing after the thing I think it's important to remember that first of all that chase is going to involve lots of ups and downs it's not going to be a lineary path it's not going to be overnight even the ones you mentioned maybe except with the exception of UA girl really extreme case um required some kind of work and ups and downs and these kinds of things right um we don't see those but more the happiness that we're going to get it's better off if we're going not for the end result that arrival and falling pray at arrival fallacy it's better if we can see some happiness um in the journey um this is often been called this idea of sort of finding a journey mindset which is sort of what can you take from the process of getting there right so you you want to run your 5K but like what can you do to try to enjoy the process of you know those runs that go along the way and noticing the kind of ups and downs and sort of paying attention to the journey it's one way to kind of break out of falling prey to this arrival fallacy requires a serious frame shift totally and I think one that you know is not culturally accepted in the US um and I think this causes a lot of you know it causes a happiness hit not just because like sometimes we don't get there sometimes there's reason you know you set your Heights super high you know you want to be Roger banister or whatever like not all of us are going to get there whether it's a four-minute mile or success at work or $50 million or whatever it is so sometimes if you set your sights too high you just don't get there and so that's a happiness hit um but a bigger Happ and sometimes when you do get there it's a happiness hit because you get there and there's the happiness for a moment but then you know that that hit doesn't keep coming um I think we also just lose out on something when we're not in that Journey mindset because there's a lot of cool stuff along the way if we can kind of pay attention but yeah I think it's a big cult shift from the way Americans usually think but if it's one that if we can achieve that we'll start feeling a lot better and it means even the failures in life are kind of good because you were enjoying yourself along the way from my podcast I did an episode about these sort of Olympic medals where I talked about um that that you know the bronze lining effect and things um and I had Michelle Quan um who you know Olympic medalist we all remember her but mostly just one silver and I talked to her about you know what that felt like and she said didn't matter to me the things I loved about being Olympics wasn't the metal stand it was when she first she talked about putting her skates on and seeing the Rings in the ice and recognizing as soon as I tie these laces I'm going to get to skate over those and I fantasize that's the journey mindset right you're not looking at the thing at the end you're paying enough attention to the stuff along the way even some of the stuff that's a pain in the butt that you kind of get some Joy um on the ride I certainly have learned to Relish in the failures as well as the successes and um you know I think some of that also just comes with age I've always wanted to say that it's true though it kind of comes you're old enough now Andrew you can you can jump into it yeah you crew enough experiences good and bad and neutral and you kind of go like the other day I was I'm like in this kind of weird state of mind I was like wait I've been here before MH like this shifts like no worries like this shifts and then sure enough it shifted you know like I think the first time we find ours in a place or we find oursel back in a place and we forget we've been there before um for whatever reason or we try and pretend we haven't been there before it's like and then you you go through enough of those Cycles like okay this is part of a larger trajectory this an amazing thing about the brain I never understood I still don't which is that when we're feeling happy we don't tend to think gosh this feeling is going to go away sometimes a little bit of that but when we're feeling lousy it does seem to do something to our sense of time our time perception that makes it seem especially in the real lows in the real trenches that it's going to go on forever we can't imagine feeling differently this two shall pass is very hard to internalize when we're in those States totally but it can make you feel a lot if you can get that distance from your current state this is kind of you know you had Ethan cross on the show that he talks a lot a lot if you can kind of get that distance of well how's this going to feel in five years how's this going to feel in 10 years you can sometimes feel a lot better interestingly even when the happy stuff if we can get some sense that like this isn't going to last forever that can sometimes boost the happiness cuz we're kind of almost doing like a negative visualization in the forward direction right um so a scarce experience if you're having it it's useful to remember like you know this is limited right this is temporary I should enjoy this now while it's happening um the most extreme version of this of course is with our own lives right contemplating our mortality um there's this idea of uh momento Mori which is a common phrase actually of my my ring has momento Mori on it um which is morbid right I'm going to die I'm not going to be here but when you recognize that you know the old school folks thought and I think it's true like you realize like I can't take any of this stuff for granted I have to pay attention now this is not you know the kind of thing that's going to last forever and so I think moments like that for positive experiences can feel like that you know if you're tasting a delicious glass of Pino Noir sitting yesterday I was you know while I'm here I you know took a walk on Santa Monica beach and was like you know my brain was like oh I have to interview Andrew coming out I was like no no I'm going to like fly back to cold you know East Coast tomorrow I need to pay attention right so thinking that this is finite can actually help you there's a very funny study on this with um college students where they did this sort of funny framing technique where they brought senior college students into lab um you know kind of halfway through you know the spring semester and told them you know you either have this many hours less of your time which Mak is a big number you know it makes it seem like thousands of hours or you have only this many days left before you graduate just like just a reminder what they found was the one that get the days manipulation where it felt kind of short they wound up doing doing more things like kind of getting in those things that they thought oh I'll get around to it eventually um and wound up kind of feeling happier so recognizing that things are short sometimes uh has a benefit um maybe both for negative emotions like this this two shall pass but also the positive stuff like this two shall pass so I got to enjoy it while it's while it's around it's so interesting because it's kind of counterintuitive that realizing that something positive is also fleeting allows us to savor it more because from a informed perspective one could imagine okay so you're you're at a great meal with people you love and it's been let's let's even say it's been a a rough month before and you're like really in it and someone says well you know like this too is going to pass you're like that sounds like kind of a downer right but then if it allows you to savor it more yeah that's key so yeah there does seem to be this inverse relationship between sad States and happy states where when we are in sad States we feel like it will go on forever and we'll do almost anything to get out of unless they've completely collapsed us in our happy States we don't want to be reminded that it will pass and this is why I think in part not the only reason why people will take um mood altering drugs I'm talking about this in the recreational sense like to to sort of forget everything else and forget that whatever they're experiencing is going to wear off yeah yeah and I think you know it it's not nice to think that these good states are going to pass I think it is helpful because it forces us to pay attention Jud to them I'm having this a little bit now where you know we're coming up on the holidays the time you and I are having this conversation and um you know I'm getting ready to do the holidays with the in-laws who you know which there's lots of positive but some like oh God I don't want to but because my my in-laws my my mom is getting up there I'm kind of like oh recognizing that there's not infinite holidays left with these people that I care about that it's kind of more finite and maybe more finite than it's been um it's causing me to be more excited about it than I would have been and so and that's morbid thought right momento Mor is meant to be a really Bittersweet emotion right that we we are finite right but it can kind of give you this appreciation it can cause you to savor in a special way so sometimes the morbid is good a little bit a little bit morbid it's the contrast again yeah yeah it's the contrast maybe it's why people watch horror movies I'm not into horror movies but so that you know maybe you feel safer I don't know that stuff always made me feel terrified if I was you know watch some of that late at night High amigdala reaction me too me too I hate horror movies but it's worth noting that like you know a lot of people like them you know huge industry um and even if you don't like horror movies you might like you know maybe a spicy food that feels kind not not even good it feels awful in the moment or super hot bath or you know cold like really cold plunge right I like getting out of the cold plunge for exactly the reason we're talking about yeah or even you know honestly for me like I'm not a super fan of exercise but like a really really hard workout that feels miserable when you finally stop it feels I do a lot of yoga and my favorite thing is at the end when they're like and now you can do shasa Shas is always good if you've worked the worst you're just really like ha you know we it's helpful to kind of have these moments to like have this contrast and so building the contrast in where you kind of give yourself some negative emotion you know whether it's a kind of imagin negative emotion like negative visualization or a fictional one a lot of our favorite fictional experiences are pretty terrible like a novel is really boring if the protagonist like has nothing bad happen just going to coast along and things are just mildly positive no we want them to go through some terrible stuff even when we really associate with them and sort of see them as ourselves and so yeah these like fictional worlds where we can play with negative emotions a little bit um are super interesting psychologically because like why would we do that but you know as you're saying even when you get you know these like neural stimulation we kind of want some of the negative stuff so um there there's a an interesting paper about what's the right ratio of positive to negative emotions um and it's not 100% positive for hedonic adaptation and so on but I think really the recipe for a rich life is is varied for these contrast reasons we've been talking about so what's the ideal ratio they don't know yeah they didn't fig they it was like like boom it's like exactly 6040 positive negative yeah here obviously anticipating a number uh and I think it's also worth remembering that um you know we're talking as though they're negative emotions and positive emotions you know a lot of the most interesting emotions are more complex than that you talked about this you know SpaceX kind of Chopsticks moment my guess is the emotion you're experiencing there is one that researchers like daker Kelner and colleagues would call a right this sense of oh my gosh that is amazing there's something bigger than me that like is able to do this thing and one of the reasons a is such an interesting emotion is it's usually destabilizing right they're like things that are better than I ever expected you know humankind is so masterful space is so big nature is so vast right it kind of feels a little destabilizing when you experience a but we also see it as positive and so I think kind of if you're feeling a little B in your emotional life trying to find moments where you can get these emotions that are not so obviously positive or negative but are a little bit of both can be um really inspiring it's one of the reasons you know you talk a lot about sort of psychedelics and these sort of altered experiences um those experiences tend to be thought of as being really consistent with moments of awe but they again are not universally positive but they kind of expand you and take you a little further I can attest that they're not universally positive sometimes they're terrifying um even in their clinical application the thing I appreciated about the rocket Landing was that indeed I I feel awe looking up at the stars at night or just thinking about how we're having this conversation in a room and well and then expanding out to like we're a little little object floating in the universe and that can be a bit overwhelming what's I think incredible is that through the harnessing of engineering and physics SpaceX was able to create something that was so U well controlled at a scale that we I'm normally accustomed to thinking about things sure I've seen planes and we landed on the moon Etc some people will debate that but we were on the moon I wasn't but somebody was to see control and harnessing of physics and Engineering at a scale that is certainly not at the scale of the entire galaxies but it's starting to approach outer space and Back Again clearly and in such a um I think it was the slowing of of that enormously large object yeah um and the capture that that felt so gratifying I also think and this um can explain a fair amount of human technological evolution is that the human brain either Delights in or at least um Marvels in creating action at a distance I mean think about what went into creating that amount of action in an in an object with that much mass at a distance right and um and then you can layer through all the things where we're looking at on our phones on our screens I mean all that technology is relatively recent and to think that us human beings as opposed to CAC monkeys could do that like we are the primate species that is so far ahead in terms of technological development compared to every other species on the planet yeah the only other species of of life that might be besting us and we don't know is I I've heard this Theory it's it's rather entertaining which is that all these trillions of microorganisms that live in our gut microbiome what if we're just vehicles for them to get around and pass to one another um and they're just they have a a sort of a uh Consciousness that is is all about just propagating and that we think that we're doing all this stuff for some Evolution but it's just to keep the microbiota going I don't really believe that finally we could get to space where we could really evolve the microbiota and they just want more microbiota so you know that that we're being hijacked I don't I I chuckle at that theory I don't actually think that's there there we talked about too few studies of dog and primate cognition way too few studies of microbiotic cognition unfortunately uh this is probably the right time to say that we are a storytelling species this is what we're doing right now we're creating story around these things that we can't quite explain and during the course of today's conversation I I realized that this thing that we call happiness um has at least three levels or layers that we filter it through when we ask ourselves are we happy how do I be happier um this element of contrast with negative experiences seems to be a repeating theme momentto Mori being a negative sort of dark cloud from which we're supposed to see the light and and act in the light this exists in religious narratives philosophical narratives um and scientific reality I could imagine three layers the first is sensory experience the reason to take a cold shower folks in addition to the fact they'll save you on your heating B bill is that the warm shower that follows in fact that's how I do it feels so good 10 times better than it would if you had just gotten into the warm shower I promise same thing about getting out of the cold plunge you know there's a lot of debate about these things but this is just pure sensory experience and contrast of the sort that we're talking about today hunger and then eating a delicious piece of food or eating a not so delicious piece of food but you're hungry and so it's that much more delicious okay million examples we could spiral her so there's sensory experience there's raw sensory perception and experience from which the contrast creates this thing that we like feel better MH AKA happiness sort of then there's story like God last year was a tough year this year was better there's also and I've seen this before like we were killing it for two years and then this year was kind of a me year this is not the case by the way but I'm very fortunate that podcast has continue to grow and expand but for some people they they're not as happy with their whatever salary this year because even though it's spectacular by somebody else's standards by their standard it's down from previous years so there's the story that we create that has it's not sensory experience it's perception based on dope of mean and its perception based on reward and Punishment Etc and then there's this third layer which is meaning MH like you said yeah you know spending time with in-laws like okay every moment of it might not be as awesome as you might like but there's meaning in spending time with people that are extended family especially when elders and very and younger are in the same room there's something really it's it's a it it layers on story to create this sort of um uh other level that we call meaning and so what I'm realizing in is that these are three time scales yeah so we have the immediate time scale of Happiness we have the kind of intermediate one where we introduce a story and then we have meaning which is kind of like this whole picture yeah so it seems to me that we need to approach happiness from all three levels that it's not enough to just be like a dog yeah which are in the sensory experience presumably of of Happiness if they tell stories they don't tell them to us and if they have meaning I don't know but they they seem to like nailed the first level yeah so and they're probably they probably don't have the capacity to do the other two so it's not like they're not doing it and kind of missing out they kind of have brains that don't let them notice they're missing out but we unfortunately have brains that would feel like we were really missing out if we just had the sensory experiences you know without the good stories I think you're sort of pointing to this idea that sort of being happy in your life and being happy with your life the withy life part has the kind of medium time scale stories but also they're really big ones right you know is my life am I doing anything really meaning with my life am I finding purpose and so on um the funny thing though is to get to that big time scale to find a sense of purpose and stuff like that sometimes it pays to do stuff at the local level at the medium and shorter term time scale um and one of the things researchers have found is that if you're engaging in activities at the short-term time scales that kind of fit with your values or what these positive psychologists have often called your strengths um that can be a way to sort of achieve purpose so so what are strengths so researchers do this thing where they want to look at like all the valuable things people can do out in the world right so what are the things that you value um and folks like Chris Peterson and colleagues have come up with this list of what they call different character strengths and there are things that like you know you can actually if you Google online character strengths you'll get the big list often people talk about they're being 24 but they're just universally good things like being brave be you know citizenship humor like you know social intelligence love of learning right you know kind of empathy fairness right these kind of sets of values that we have people differ and how much they value one or the other you know so I could ask you Andrew like what's better like bravery or humor probably both pretty high for you I would imagine but like about Prudence versus love of learning I have a guess yeah I mean if I had to pick between bravery and humor I I think bravery is probably more important to me I'm more humor yeah I mean I love humor but if I had to pick it's sort of like you know steak and coffee I'm going steak Yeah the point is we there are individual differences in this um and there are formal tests you can do online if you Google the IIA character strengths test you'll see these 24 and you can do one of these very systematic you know kind of tests to do it but really just kind to think about like what are the values that you value um and the ones that come to mind as being particularly about you the ones that you resonate with are what somebody like Chris Peterson would call your signature strengths they're the ones that when you execute them you kind of feel like things are meaningful and purposeful and so on and so the idea is that a one recipe for a person a purposeful life at the local level um is trying to engage in behaviors that allow you to use more of these values or strengths um and one of my favorite pieces of research that looks at both the power of this and how even though if it seems like that those are hard things to bring in like you should bring them in more um is some work by this woman Amy rinsky who's a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and she does these studies on what she calls job crafting um which is a practice where you take your normal job description is whatever your job is and figure out ways that you can Infuse your signature strengths into to them you know so you as a podcaster if your signature sank with bravery you could bring in guests that made me feel a little bit intimidating to you probably like me I imagine but but or like you could take on topics that are a little bit harder right that kind of push you a little bit right if your signature strength was humor you'd add more company or make more jokes if it was love of learning you'd pick topics that like you didn't know anything about but you kind of dive in right you take whatever your normal job description is and you find a way to build in your strengths and the reason I love Amy's work so much is that she studies signature strengths not in academics like us who have very flexible jobs or podcasters she studies signature strengths in hospital janitorial staff workers um who are you know these are people who are cleaning the linen in a hospital room or mopping the floors and stuff not a job where you think there's lots of flexibility or you could build in things like you know humor and love of learning and this stuff but she finds interestingly that like around a quarter to a third of these janitorial staff workers say that their job is a calling they love it they get a lot of purpose from it and and they're the ones that are naturally building in their signature strengths and she tells in her story in her work she tells these lovely stories there a story of a janitorial staff worker who worked uh in a chemotherapy Ward and if you've been unlucky enough to have cancer and had to have chemotherapy or know someone who did you know that people tend to get really sick because the medicine makes people really nauseous so a big part of this guy's job was like cleaning up vomit basically but he said you know my job isn't to clean my vomit my strengths are like humor and social intelligence and what I do is I make a joke this is somebody a really crappy day and I'm going to do something that's going to make them laugh and if I do that then I W it's not my paycheck and I guess he had a standard joke which is like oh my god look like a big pile of vit over time like for me and like you know you're laughing listeners probably laughing he's like that's my job um he talked to another worker who worked in a coma Ward so this um individual couldn't talk to the patients because they're in comas but her strength was creativity and so every day she like moved the artwork and the plants around you know just kind of created some changes and she thought maybe that would pop people out of their com I don't know if that's medically plausible probably not but it doesn't matter to her she felt like she was executing her creativity and so the moral of this job crafting work is no matter what your job is there's probably some room to build in some more purpose if you take some time to think about like what are the strengths what are the things that get you going if you need a tip you can kind of Google these things but then how could I Infuse that into my normal job description and there's probably a lot more flexibility than you think you don't need to quit your job and become a podcaster to like get this flexibility probably whatever you do there's some window where you can build that in that's awesome those are awesome stories um I also was just thinking about the chander cleaning up the vomit like to like like restore some dignity to these people that ex clearly know they're making a mess and like you know humor being the ultimate bridge and um and uh darn it why' you make me have to choose between humor and the other thing but CU humor thinking my answer it's very brave to clean up V well I think right yeah and to and to bring humor to a place where you know some people might presume humor is not allowed but goodness um the signature strengths and the and the list of you said 24 of them where can people learn more about these signature strengths I think this would be a really powerful exercise and uh we can always find the link and put it in the show note captions but is there like a place that people can find this stuff the values and action is viia character strengths. org um so I can share the link and you can stick it in your show notes but yeah people can go on there for free and do one of these kind of you know formal psychometric tests where you measure your strengths see what they are and it's a fun website too because you get to kind of they give you some suggestions because some of these you know values are like Prudence is one of them like how do I exercise prudence and they'll have you know these are different things um they also make the suggestion and this is a a homework assignment I give in my happiness class of suggesting you do this with a good friend or a romantic partner have each of you do this and find strengths that you share together um and then you can go on what what researchers call a strength state where you know if you both have bravery then that means you guys should do the I don't know the obstacle course or do some really scary hike if you both have humor now you go to a comedy show if you both love learning now you go to a museum or something so you find the thing that's like your convergent strengths and you do something that exercises them so that means you can use your strengths to get purpose not just in your work but in your leisure too and I think this is another spot where we get stuff wrong I think a lot of us have work that tends to use our strengths we tend to gravitate towards careers many of us where we can use our strengths a lot of folks aren't that lucky but in our leisure time we don't often do that so much right often our leisure time is like plop down you know watch Netflix for a lot of folks like if you think about how you can build your strengths into your leisure time it gets even more exciting so you know you're talking about working with your hands and doing all this stuff like you know build the bravery and the humor into that somehow and now you get your leisure time doing double duty for giving you a sense of purpose and meaning too I love doing stuff with my hands and I also love doing things that are useful to other people and years ago I used to go set up fish tanks for people at their homes and I I don't know why when I just kept setting up all these fish tanks for all these people I delighted in it and um it makes me realize that I think for everybody certainly not just me that we get tremendous pleasure from being useful to others in ways that really resonate with kind of who who we feel we are and these strengths I think that's kind of the ultimate situation really and if we're getting paid for it also great but you're saying work it into um your recreational time as as well yeah and I'm glad you brought up this idea of doing for others because we haven't talked about that but this is another behavioral hack that's huge for happiness and I think one that we get wrong as a culture in the US but kind of broadly there's all this talk about self-care or treat yourself if you look at any kind of article about happiness maybe not so evidence-based talking about self self self self if you look at happy people though happy people don't spend a lot of time on the themselves they tend to be very other oriented so controlled for income happier people donate more money to charity than not so happy people um for the amount of free time people have happy people tend to volunteer for others broadly construed whether it's you know helping formally or kind of donating time like they tend to help more than not so happy people um that again correlation it could be happy doing nice stuff for others helps you become happy it could be that if you're happy you do nice stuff for others and for sure that link is true there is this thing called the feel good do good effect um but lots of experiments have sort of forced people to do nice stuff for others and found that it winds up making them happier one study uh by Lara aknan and colleagues did this study where they walk up to people on the street and hand them 20 bucks it's awesome study to be if you're some undergrad walking around on campus like oh cool 20 bucks but then you'll be told how to spend it you either have to spend the 20 bucks to treat yourself do something nice for yourself or spend the 20 bucks on someone else do something nice for other people and people at the end of the day and even kind of a later time scales report being happier when they spend the exact same amount of money on someone else versus themselves and I think this has a big message because sometimes I don't know if you're in I don't know if you like you but if you're having a bad day it's like I'm going to treat myself for something I might buy something or spend some money on myself by myself a kind of cool experience but if you gifted that experience to your brother or your good friend your cooworker your spouse it might actually make you happier than having that experience yourself which is really counterintuitive but it's what the data show I've discovered this in recent years I love love love giving gifts it just um it's the best feeling it's the best feeling here's here's another hack you can do to help to kind of help others oddly is to ask for help which is something thing we forget is quite powerful um think about the last time somebody asked you for advice advice that you could give probably felt pretty good it probably made you feel a little competent or whatever um probably liked helping that person you get the happiness Boost from helping that person we forget that asking other people for help especially when we know they can kind of do it um can be a way to sort of give them a little B gift and make them happy um this is one that can be hard for me because I like to you know think about my competence all the time and I don't want to be a burden on people I don't vulnerable yes self um but it turns out especially if you're a particularly self-sufficient person when you ask people for help it can be really useful so um so that's another one you know because I know some folks listening right now might not have the financial means to be donating money or the you know time affluence and wherewithal to be doing gifts and these things but remember that asking for help can be a gift to someone else and it's a little social connection too that's awesome I will also say your suggestion that people um fill out the signature strengths site and then use that as a first date incentive I look forward to the day when a comment comes through on YouTube that uh people were married as a consequence of a first date TI's going out of business if we start doing these strength dates like that so yeah every once in a while someone will um contact me and say that they um watched the fertility episode and uh did a male and female fertility episode and um that they now have uh a child on the way um I don't ask questions about when the child was conceived like what the relationship to the fertility episode was was I'm assuming it was the information in the fertility episode but the um but I always I'm like wow that's wild so I I bet you that at some point in the future I'm creating a little bit of a time capsule here um you'll get contacted or something will um legitimately fall into the comments about people deciding to spend their life together as a consequence of having done the signature strength first date you heard it here first from Dr lri Santos and in all seriousness um Lori Dr Santos I just want to say thank you so much for doing the work you do it's awesome awesome work I mean what's more important than our emotional state and to strive to be happy but to understand happiness so that we're not pursuing something that either doesn't exist or that um is an illusion that's been created for us like really I think one of the amazing things about what you do is you realistically frame happiness as attainable but you frame it in the science of how to actually get it it um and what it means and as people could probably detect I love love love that you've studied this thing that we call happiness and other aspects of of emotion and social cognition in the context of not just humans but our non-human friends cats and dogs and use that knowledge like building up from basic understanding of how neural circuits and psychology work to a place that humans can really act on and you've given us a tremendous number of actionable tools today I mean too need to list off here all at once we'll put them in the time stamps as as tools so that people can get right to them and review them but the social connection piece obviously the understanding of the contrast with difficult things to arrive at better States um and different time scales and doing for others and and just so much there's too much here for me to to list off without adding another 30 minutes to this uh podcast and no one wants to hear me um speak anymore um so I'm just going to say thank you for the research that you have done and continued to do thank you for doing your podcast I'm going to start listening to your podcast I love these issues and I think they're super super uh timely and important uh for everybody and thanks for taking time out of your schedule to come here and educate us today

Published: 2024-12-19 13:00:11 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how neuroplasticity allows the brain to continue to adapt and change throughout life, particularly through focused attention and active engagement in learning.

I explain how neuroplasticity differs in children and adults, highlighting the key neurochemicals required for adult learning. I explain science-supported protocols to boost alertness and improve attention, including techniques like visual focus and goal accountability. I also discuss how sleep, along with practices such as non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) and naps, support the brain to enhance learning. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we're talking about neuroplasticity, which is this incredible feature of our nervous system's that allows it to change in response to experience. Neuroplasticity is arguably one of the most important aspects of our biology. It holds the promise for each and all of us to think differently, to learn new things, to forget painful experiences, and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us by becoming better. So let's get started. Most people are familiar with the word "neuroplasticity," which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change itself. All of us were born with a nervous system that isn't just capable of change but was designed to change. When we enter the world, our nervous system is primed for learning. The brain and nervous system of a baby is wired very crudely. The connections are not precise, and we can see evidence of that in the fact that babies are kind of flopping there, like a little potato bug with limbs. They can't really do much in terms of coordinated movement. They certainly can't speak, and they can't really do anything with precision. So I want you to imagine in your mind that when you were brought into this world, you were essentially a widely connected web of connections that was really poor at doing any one thing, and that through your experience, what you were exposed to by your parents or other caretakers, through your social interactions, through your thoughts, through the languages that you learned, through the places you traveled or didn't travel, your nervous system became customized to your unique experience. Now, that's true for certain parts of your brain that are involved in what we call representations of the outside world. A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world, or represent the auditory world, or represent the gallery of smells that are possible in the world. However, there are aspects of your nervous system that were designed not to be plastic. They were wired so that plasticity or changes in those circuits is very unlikely. Those circuits include things like the ones that control your heartbeat. The ones that control your breathing. The ones that control your digestion. And thank goodness that those circuits were set up that way, because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable. So many nervous system features, like digestion and breathing and heart rate, are hard to change. Other aspects of our nervous system are actually quite easy to change. And one of the great gifts of childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is that we can learn through almost passive experience. We don't have to focus that hard in order to learn new things. And then after age 25, if we want to change those connections, those superhighways of connectivity, we have to engage in some very specific processes. And those processes, as we'll soon learn, are gated, meaning you can't just decide to change your brain. You actually have to go through a series of steps to change your internal state in ways that will allow you to change your brain. Many of us have been captivated by the stories in the popular press about the addition of new neurons, this idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise, your brain actually makes new neurons. Well, I'm going to give you the bad news, which is that after puberty, the human brain and nervous system adds very few, if any, new neurons. So even though we can't add new neurons throughout our lifespan, at least not in very great numbers, it's clear that we can change our nervous system, that the nervous system is available for change, that if we create the right set of circumstances in our brain, chemical circumstances, and if we create the right environmental circumstances around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode in which change isn't just possible, but it's probable. As I mentioned before, the hallmark of the child nervous system is change. It wants to change. One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity at any stage throughout the lifespan is through deficits and impairments in what we call our sensory apparati-- our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth. In individuals that are blind from birth, the so-called occipital cortex, the visual cortex in the back, becomes overtaken by hearing. The neurons there will start to respond to sounds as well as Braille touch. And actually, there is one particularly tragic incident where a woman who was blind since birth and, because of neuroimaging studies, we knew her visual cortex was no longer visual. It was responsible for Braille reading and for hearing. She had a stroke that actually took out most of the function of her visual cortex. So then she was blind, she couldn't Braille read, or hear. She did recover some aspect of function. Now, most people, they don't end up in that highly unfortunate situation. And what we know is that, for instance, blind people who use their visual cortex for Braille reading and for hearing have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity, meaning they can sense things with their fingers and they can sense things with their hearing that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able to. In fact, you will find a much greater incidence of perfect pitch in people that are blind. And that tells us that the brain and, in particular, this area we call the neocortex, which is the outer part, is really designed to be a map of our own individual experience. So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss, where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth or maybe has a limb development impairment where they have a stump instead of an entire limb with a functioning hand, their brain will represent the body plan that they have, not some other body plan. But the beauty of the situation is that the real estate up in the skull, that neocortex, the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience. A few years ago, I was at a course, and a woman came up to me and she said, you know, I-- I wasn't teaching the course. I was in the course. And she said, I just have to tell you that every time you speak, it really stresses me out. And I said, well, I've heard that before. But do you want to be more specific? And she said, yeah, your tone of voice reminds me of somebody that I had a really terrible experience with. I said, well, OK, well, I can't change my voice, but I really appreciate that you acknowledge that. And it also will help explain why you seem to cringe every time I speak, which I hadn't noticed until then. But after that, I did notice she had a very immediate and kind of visceral response to my speech. But in any event, over the period of this two-week course, she would come back every once in a while and say, you know what? I think just by telling you that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to, it's actually becoming more tolerable to me. And by the end, we actually became pretty good friends, and we're still in touch. And so what this says is that the recognition of something, whether or not that's an emotional thing or a desire to learn something else, is actually the first step in neuroplasticity. If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the door, I don't think about each step that I'm taking. And that's because I learned how to walk during development. But when we decide that we're going to shift some sort of behavior or some reaction or some new piece of information that we want to learn is something that we want to bring into our consciousness, that awareness is a remarkable thing because it cues the brain and the rest of the nervous system that when we engage in those reflexive actions going forward, that those reflexive actions are no longer fated to be reflexive. Now, if this sounds a little bit abstract, we're going to talk about protocols for how to do this. But the first step in neuroplasticity is recognizing that you want to change something. We have to know what it is exactly that we want to change. Or if we don't know exactly what it is that we want to change, we at least have to know that we want to change something about some specific experience. Now, there are specific protocols that science tells us we have to follow if we want those changes to occur. What it is, is it's our forebrain, in particular our prefrontal cortex, signaling the rest of our nervous system that something that we're about to do, hear, feel, or experience is worth paying attention to. So we'll pause there, and then I'm going to move forward. One of the biggest lies in the universe that seems quite prominent right now is that every experience you have changes your brain. People love to say this. They love to say, your brain is going to be different after this lecture, or your brain is going to be different after today's class than it was two days ago. And that's absolutely not true. The nervous system doesn't just change because you experience something unless you're a very young child. The nervous system changes when certain neurochemicals are released and allow whatever neurons are active in the period in which those chemicals are swimming around to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons. So when people tell you, oh, at the end of today's lecture, at the end of something, your brain is going to be completely different, that's simply not true. If you're older than 25, your brain will not change unless there's a selective shift in your attention or a selective shift in your experience that tells the brain it's time to change. And those changes occur through strengthening and weakening of particular connections. But the important thing to understand is that if we want something to change, we really need to bring an immense amount of attention to whatever it is that we want to change. This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier about it all starts with an awareness. Now, why is that attention important? In the early '90s, a graduate student by the name of Gregg Recanzone was in the laboratory of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF. And they set out to test this idea that if one wants to change their brain, they need to do it early in life because the adult brain simply isn't plastic. It's not available for these changes. And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments, by now, I think we can say proving that the adult brain can change, provided certain conditions are met. Now, the experiments they did are tough. They were tough on the experimenter, and they were tough on the subject. I'll just describe one. Let's say you were a subject in one of their experiments. You would come into the lab, and you'd sit down at a table, and they would record from or image your brain and look at the representation of your fingers, the digits, as we call them. And there would be a spinning drum, literally like a stone drum in front of you, or metal drum, that had little bumps. Some of the bumps were spaced close together, some of them were spaced far apart. And they would do these experiments where they would expect their subjects to press a lever whenever, for instance, the bumps got closer together or further apart. And these were very subtle differences. So in order to do this, you really have to pay attention to the distance between the bumps. And these were not Braille readers or anyone skilled in doing these kinds of experiments. What they found was that as people paid more and more attention to the distance between these bumps-- and they would signal when there was a change by pressing a lever. As they did that, there was very rapid changes, plasticity in the representation of the fingers. And it could go in either direction. You could get people very good at detecting the distance between bumps that the distance was getting smaller or the distance was getting greater. So people could get very good at these tasks that are kind of hard to imagine how they would translate to the real world for a non-Braille reader. But what it told us is that these maps of touch were very much available for plasticity, and these were fully adult subjects. What it proved is that the adult brain is very plastic. And they did some beautiful control experiments that are important for everyone to understand, which is that sometimes they would bring people in and they would have them touch these bumps on this spinning drum, but they would have the person pay attention to an auditory cue. Every time a tone would go off or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone, they would have to signal that. So the subject thought they were doing something related to touch and hearing. And all that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action of touching these bumps; they had to pay attention to the bumps themselves. If they were placing their attention on the auditory cue, on the tone, well, then there was plasticity in the auditory portion of the brain, but not on the touch portion of the brain. And this really spits in the face of this thing that you hear so often, which is, every experience that you have is going to change the way your brain works. Absolutely not. The experiences that you pay super careful attention to are what open up plasticity, and it opens up plasticity to that specific experience. So the question then is, why? And Merzenich and his graduate students and postdocs went on to address this question of why. And it turns out, the answer is a very straightforward neurochemical answer. And the first neurochemical is epinephrine, also adrenaline. We call it adrenaline when it's released from the adrenal glands above our kidneys. That's in the body. We call it epinephrine in the brain, but they are chemically identical substances. Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem called locus ceruleus. Epinephrine is released when we pay attention and when we are alert. But the most important thing for getting plasticity is that there be epinephrine, which equates to alertness, plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine. Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain. One is also in the brainstem, and it's named different things in different animals. But in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons, or neurons that make acetylcholine, is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region. All you need to know is that you have an area in your brainstem, and that area sends wires, these axons, up into the area of the brain that filters sensory input. So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus, and it is getting bombarded with all sorts of sensory input all the time. But when I pay attention to something, I create a cone of attention, and what we call signal to noise goes up. So those of you with an engineering background will be familiar with signal to noise. Those of you who do not have an engineering background, don't worry about it. All it means is that one particular shout in the crowd comes through. Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight. But epinephrine for alertness, acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs, those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity. There needs to be this third component, and the third component is acetylcholine released from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis. If you really want to get technical, it's called nucleus basalis of Meynert. For any of you that are budding physicians or going to medical school, you should know that. If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem, acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis, and epinephrine, you can change your brain. And this has been shown again and again and again in a variety of papers, and it is now considered a fundamental principle of how the nervous system works. If you can access these three things of epinephrine, acetylcholine from these two sources, not only will the nervous system change, it has to change. It absolutely will change. And that is the most important thing for people to understand if they want to change their brain. So now let's talk about how we would translate all this scientific information into some protocols that you can actually apply because I think that's what many of you are interested in. What you do with your health and your medical care is up to you. You're responsible for your health and well-being. So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to take, I'm going to describe what the literature tells us and suggests about ways to access plasticity. We know we need epinephrine. That means alertness. Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee and a good night's sleep. So I will say you should master your sleep schedule, and you should figure out how much sleep you need in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn. But once that's in place, the question then is, how do I access this alertness? Well, there are a number of ways. Some people use some pretty elaborate psychological gymnastics. They will tell people that they're going to do something and create some accountability. That could be really good. Or they'll post a picture of themselves online, and they'll commit to learning a certain amount-- losing, excuse me, a certain amount of weight or something like this. So they can use either shame-based practices to potentially embarrass themselves if they don't follow through. They'll write checks to organizations that they hate and insist that they'll cash them if they don't actually follow through. Or they'll do it out of love. They'll decide that they're going to run a marathon or learn a language or something because of somebody they love, or they want to devote it to somebody. The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine and getting alert and activated, it doesn't really matter. Epinephrine is a chemical, and your brain does not distinguish between doing things out of love or hate, anger, or fear. It really doesn't. All of those promote autonomic arousal and the release of epinephrine. So I think for most people, if you're feeling not motivated to make these changes, the key thing is to identify not just one, but probably a kit of reasons, several reasons as to why you would want to make this particular change. And being drawn toward a particular goal that you're excited about can be one. Also being motivated to not be completely afraid, ashamed, or humiliated for not following through on a goal is another. Come up with two or three things, fear-based, perhaps, love-based, perhaps, or perhaps several of those in order to ensure alertness, energy, and attention for the task. And that brings us to the attention part. Now, it's one thing to have an electrode embedded into your brain and increase the amount of acetylcholine. It's another to exist in the real world outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing, having trouble bringing your attention to a particular location in space for a particular event. And there's a lot of discussion nowadays about smartphones and devices creating a sort of attention deficit, almost at a clinical level for many people, including adults. I think that's largely true. And what it means, however, is that we all are responsible for learning how to create depth of focus. There are some important neuroscience principles to get depth of focus. I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first because I always get asked about this. People say, what can I take to increase my levels of acetylcholine? Well, there are things you can take. Nicotine is called nicotine because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor. There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic. But the nicotinic ones are involved in attention and alertness. I have colleagues-- these are not my kind of like bro science buddies. I have those friends, too. This is a Nobel Prize-winning colleague who chews Nicorette while he works. But when I asked him, why are you doing this, he said, well, it increases my alertness and focus. Now, I've tried chewing Nicorette. It makes me super jittery. I don't like it because I can't focus very well. It kind of takes me too far up the level of autonomic arousal. I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day. If you're going to go down that route, you want to be very careful how much you rely on those all the time because the essence of plasticity is to create a window of attention and focus that's distinct from the rest of your day. So what are some ways that you can increase acetylcholine? How do you increase focus? The best way to get better at focusing is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with. And the key principle here is that mental focus follows visual focus. We are all familiar with the fact that our visual system can be unfocused, blurry, or jumping around, or we can be very laser-focused on one location in space. What's interesting and vitally important to understanding how to access neuroplasticity is that you can use your visual focus, and you can increase your visual focus as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities more broadly. So I'm going to explain how to do that. Plasticity starts with alertness. That alertness can come from a sense of love, a sense of joy, a sense of fear. Doesn't matter. There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness, too. The most common one is, of course, caffeine. Many people are now also using Adderall. Adderall will not increase focus. It increases alertness. It does not touch the acetylcholine system. The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings is available, as I mentioned, through pharmacology, but also through these behavioral practices. And the behavioral practices that are anchored in visual focus are going to be the ones that are going to allow you to develop great depth and duration of focus. So let's think about visual focus for a second. When we focus on something visually, we have two options. We can either look at a very small region of space with a lot of detail and a lot of precision, or we can dilate our gaze and we can see big pieces of visual space with very little detail. It's a trade-off. We can't look at everything at high resolution. This is why we have these. The pupil more or less relates to the fovea of the eye, which is the area in which we have the most receptors, the highest density of receptors that perceive light. And so our acuity is much better in the center of our visual field than in our periphery. When we focus our eyes, we do a couple of things. First of all, we tend to do that in the center of our visual field, and our two eyes tend to align in what's called a vergence eye movement towards a common point. The other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves, so that our brain, now, no longer sees the entire visual world, but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery. That small cone of visual imagery, or soda straw view of the world, has much higher acuity, higher resolution, than if I were to look at everything. Now you say, of course, this makes perfect sense. But that's about visual attention, not mental attention. Well, it turns out that focus in the brain is anchored to our visual system. I'll talk about blind people in a moment. But assuming that somebody is sighted, the key is to learn how to focus better visually if you want to bring about higher levels of cognitive or mental focus. When we move our eyes slightly inward-- maybe you can tell that I'm doing this-- like so, basically shortening or making the interpupillary distance, as it's called, smaller, two things happen. Not only do we develop a smaller visual window into the world, but we activate a set of neurons in our brain stem that trigger the release of both norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine. Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrine. So in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head, when we're just kind of looking at our entire visual environment, moving our head around, moving through space, we're in optic flow, things moving past us, we're sitting still, we're looking broadly at our space, we're relaxed. When our eyes move slightly inward toward a particular visual target, our visual world shrinks, our level of visual focus goes up, and we know that this relates to the release of acetylcholine and epinephrine at the relevant sites in the brain for plasticity. Now, what this means is that if you have a hard time focusing your mind for sake of reading or for listening, you need to practice-- and you can practice-- focusing your visual system. Now, this works best if you practice focusing your visual system at the precise distance from the work that you intend to do for sake of plasticity. So how would this look in the real world? Let's say I am trying to concentrate on something related to, I don't know, science. I'm reading a science paper and I'm having a hard time. It's not absorbing. Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not just my visual acuity for that location, but it brings about an increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated with gathering information from this location. So, put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, you may ask, well, what about the experiment where people were feeling this rotating drum or listening to the auditory cue? That does involve vision at all. Ah. If you look at people who are learning things with their auditory system, they will often close their eyes. And that's not a coincidence. If somebody is listening very hard, please don't ask them to look you directly in the eye while also asking that they listen to you. That's actually one of the worst ways to get somebody to listen to you. If you say, now listen to me and look me in the eye, the visual system will take over and they'll see your mouth move, but they're going to hear their thoughts more than they're going to hear what you're saying. Closing the eyes is one of the best ways to create a cone of auditory attention. And this is what low-vision or no-vision folks do. They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention in particular locations. And for most people, vision is the primary way to train up this focus ability and these cones of attention. So you absolutely have to focus on the thing that you're trying to learn, and you will feel some agitation because of the epinephrine in your system. If you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus and you're feeling like you're not doing it right, chances are you're doing it right. So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness, you get the acetylcholine released and you can focus your attention, then the question is, for how long? And in an earlier podcast, I talked about these ultradian cycles that last about 90 minutes. The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes. I think that learning bout will no doubt include 5 to 10 minutes of a warm-up period. I think everyone should give themselves permission to not be fully focused in the early part of that bout, but that in the middle of that bout for the middle hour or so, you should be able to maintain focus for about an hour or so. So that, for me, means eliminating distractions. That means turning off the Wi-Fi. I put my phone in the other room. I encourage you to try experiencing what it is to be completely immersed in an activity where you feel the agitation that your attention is drifting, but you continually bring it back. And that's an important point, which is that attention drifts, but we have to re-anchor it. We have to keep grabbing it back. And the way to do that, if you're sighted, is with your eyes, that as your attention drifts and you look away, you want to try and literally maintain visual focus on the thing that you're trying to learn. That's the trigger for plasticity. But the real secret is that neuroplasticity doesn't occur during wakefulness, it occurs during sleep. We now know that if you focus very hard on something for about 90 minutes or so, maybe you even do several bouts of that per day, if you can do that-- some people can. Some people can only do one focus bout of learning-- that night and the following nights while you sleep, the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will, with acetylcholine transmission, will strengthen. And other ones will be lost, which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity. And what it means is that when you eventually wake up a couple of days or a week later, you will have acquired the knowledge forever, unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it. So mastering sleep is key in order to reinforce the learning that occurs. But let's say you get a really poor night of sleep after a bout of learning. Chances are, if you sleep the next night or the following night, that learning will occur. There's a stamp in the brain where this acetylcholine was released. It actually marks those synapses neurochemically and metabolically so that those synapses are more biased to change. Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep, then you probably won't get those changes. There is also a way in which you can bypass the need for deep sleep, at least partially, by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest, these NSDR protocols. But I just want to discuss the science of this. There was a paper that was published in Cell Reports last year that shows that if people did-- it was a spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one, where they had to remember the sequence of lights lighting up. And if there were just two or three lights in a particular sequence, it's easy. But as you get up to 15 or 16 lights and numbers in the sequence, it actually gets quite challenging. If immediately after-- and it was immediately after the learning, the actual performance of this task, people took a 20-minute non-sleep deep-rest protocol or took a shallow nap, so lying down, feet slightly elevated, perhaps, just closing their eyes, no sensory input, the rates of learning were significantly higher for that information than were they to just had a good night's sleep the following night. So you can actually accelerate learning with these NSDR protocols or with brief naps, 90 minutes or less. For many people, letting the mind drift, where it's not organized in thought, after a period of very deliberate, focused effort, is the best way to accelerate learning and depth of learning. I want to synthesize some of the information that we've covered up until now. Today, I want to make sure that these key elements that form the backbone of neuroplasticity are really embedded in people's minds. First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan. If you want to learn as an adult, you have to be alert. It might seem so obvious, but I think a lot of people don't think about when in their 24-hour cycle they're most alert. Just ask yourself when during the day do you typically tend to be most alert? That will afford you an advantage in learning specific things during that period of time. So don't give up that period of time for things that are meaningless, useless, or not aligned with your goals. That epinephrine released from your brain stem is going to occur more readily at particular phases of your 24-hour cycle than others-- during the waking phase, of course. You should know when those are. Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished pharmacologically through nicotine. However, there are certain dangers for many people to do that, as well as a cost. financial cost. Learning how to engage the cholinergic system through the use of the visual system. Practicing; how long can you maintain focus with blinks as you need them. But how long can you maintain visual focus on a target, just on a piece of paper set a few feet away in the room, or at the level of your computer screen. These are actually things that people do in communities where high levels of visual focus are necessary. What we're really talking about here is trying to harness the mechanisms of attention and get better at paying attention. You may want to do that with your auditory system, not with your visual system, either because you're low-vision or no-vision, or because you're trying to learn something that relates more to sounds. You should also ask yourself whether or not you're trying to focus too much for too long during the day. I know some very high-performing individuals, very high-performing in a variety of contexts, and none of them are focused all day long. Many of them take walks down the hallway, sometimes mumbling to themselves or not paying attention to anything else. They go for bike rides, they take walks. They are not trying to engage their mind at maximum focus all the time. Very few people do that because we learn best in these 90-minute bouts inside of one of these ultradian cycles. And I should repeat again that within that 90-minute cycle, you should not expect yourself to focus for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle. The beginning and end are going to be a little bit flickering in and out of focus. How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles is starting? Well, typically when you wake up is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle, but it's not down to the minute. You'll be able to tap into your sense of these 90-minute cycles as you start to engage in these learning practices, should you choose. And then, of course, getting some non-sleep deep rest or just deliberate disengagement, such as walking or running or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open, kind of mindlessly, it might seem, in a chair. Just letting your thoughts move around after a learning bout will accelerate the rate of plasticity. And then, of course, deep sleep.

Title: Life Advice: What to Aim For
Published: 2024-12-18 02:02:20 UTC
Description:
My guest on the Huberman Lab episode out now is Dr. Bernardo Huberman. He is a physicist who immigrated to the United States to conduct research on particle physics, later transitioning to chaos theory before moving into computer science and quantum computing. As his last name suggests, he is also my father.

In this episode, we explore what it means to let curiosity guide major career decisions—the benefits, the risks, and the challenge of balancing career ambitions with everyday life.

The audio in this clip features his response to a question I asked during the podcast: “Do you have any wishes for me—[and for anyone wondering what to aspire to in life]?”

Our conversation also delves into topics like science, family, leaving a politically unstable country for the United States, social dynamics, patriotism, the tension between tradition and self-expression, and, of course, the relationship between parents and children—including why a bit of rebellion can foster personal growth when it serves a meaningful purpose.

This was obviously a deeply meaningful episode for me to record, given that Dr. Huberman is my father. I also believe the discussion will resonate broadly, particularly with those who frequently switch fields of interest—a journey Dr. Huberman has embraced repeatedly over more than five decades.

Transcript Language: English
I don't want to use the word happy. I want to see you joyful. Joy. Joy is more important than happiness. Joy is a state of mind. Happiness is okay, yeah, I said a list of things I want to have, and I have them, and I smile a lot. Joyfulness is this sense of being in yourself, and I would like that. I would personally like to see you enjoying today and this weekend, and that's it, and everything else is going to come to you.

Title: How to Use Curiosity & Focus to Create a Joyful & Meaningful Life | Dr. Bernardo Huberman
Published: 2024-12-16 13:01:07 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Bernardo Huberman, Ph.D., a research physicist, expert on quantum networks, and vice president of CableLabs’ Next-Gen Systems. We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  

We explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.

Title: Understand and Use Dreams to Learn and Forget | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2024-12-12 13:00:52 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the important role that sleep and dreams have in learning, regulating emotions, and recovering from trauma.

I discuss how dreams during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep contribute to emotional learning and the processing of traumatic experiences. I also discuss the similarities of REM dreams to clinical treatments like ketamine and EMDR therapy. I explain how non-REM dreams function differently to support other types of learning. Additionally, I describe science-backed strategies to optimize both types of sleep for improved learning, mood and emotional regulation.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're going to talk about dreaming, learning during dreaming, as well as unlearning during dreaming, in particular, unlearning of challenging emotional events. Now, numerous people throughout history have tried to make sense of dreams in some sort of organized way. The most famous of which, of course, is Sigmund Freud, who talked about symbolic representations in dreams. A lot of that has been kind of debunked, although I think that there's some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are. And this is something that we'll talk about in more depth today, although not Freudian theory in particular. So I think in order to really think about dreams and what to do with them and how to maximize the dream experience for sake of learning and unlearning, the best way to address this is to look at the physiology of sleep, to really address, what do we know concretely about sleep? So first of all, as we get sleepy, we tend to shut our eyes. And that's because there are some autonomic centers in the brain, some neurons that control closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy. And then we transition into sleep. And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep, is generally broken up into a series of 90-minute cycles, these ultradian cycles. So early in the night, these 90-minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep and slow wave sleep. And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep, R-E-M sleep, which stands for Rapid Eye Movement sleep. For every 90-minute cycle that we have during a night of sleep, we tend to start having more and more REM sleep. So more of that 90-minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow wave sleep. Now, this is true regardless of whether or not you wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom or your sleep is broken. The more sleep you're getting across the night, the more REM sleep you're going to have. And REM sleep and non-REM, as I'll refer to it, have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning. And they are responsible for learning and unlearning of distinctly different types of information. And this has enormous implications for learning of motor skills, for unlearning of traumatic events, or for processing emotionally challenging as well as emotionally pleasing events. And as we'll see, one can actually leverage their daytime activities in order to access more slow wave sleep or non-REM sleep, as we'll call it, or more REM sleep, depending on your particular emotional and physical needs. So it's really a remarkable stage of life that we have a lot more control and power over than you might believe. So let's start by talking about slow wave sleep or non-REM sleep. So slow wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity in which the brain is metabolically active but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain. Now, the interesting thing about slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it, that are most active and least active during slow wave sleep. And here's why. To remind you, neuromodulators are these chemicals that act rather slowly. But their main role is to bias particular brain circuits to be active and other brain circuits to not be active. And they are associated as a consequence with certain brain functions. So we know, for instance, and just to review, acetylcholine in waking states is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity of brain circuits associated with focus and attention. Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the brain circuits associated with alertness and the desire to move. Serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released and tends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body that are associated with bliss and a desire to remain still. And dopamine is the neuromodulator that's released and is associated with amplification of the neural circuits in the brain and body associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward. So in slow wave sleep, something really interesting happens. There's essentially no acetylcholine. And acetylcholine, as I just mentioned, is associated with focus. So you can think of slow wave sleep as these big, sweeping waves of activity through the brain and a kind of distortion of space and time so that we're not really focusing on any one thing. Now, the other molecules that are very active at that time are norepinephrine, which is a little bit surprising. Because normally, in waking states, norepinephrine is going to be associated with a lot of alertness and the desire to move. But there's not a ton of norepinephrine around in slow wave sleep. But it is around. So there's something associated with the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep. And remember, this is happening mostly at the beginning of the night. Your sleep is dominated by slow wave sleep. So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine, although there is some, and a lot of serotonin. And serotonin, again, is associated with this desire, this sensation of bliss or well-being but not a lot of movement. And during sleep, you tend not to move. Now, in slow wave sleep, you can move. You're not paralyzed. So you can roll over. If people are going to sleepwalk, typically it's going to be during slow wave sleep. And what studies have shown through some kind of sadistic experiments, where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep-- and that can be done by waking them up as soon as the electrode recordings show that they're in slow wave sleep or by chemically altering their sleep so that it biases them away from slow wave sleep. What studies have shown is that motor learning is generally occurring in slow wave sleep. So let's say the day before you go to sleep, you were learning some new dance move or you were learning some specific motor skill, either a fine motor skill or a coarse motor skill. Learning of those skills is happening primarily during slow wave sleep, in the early part of the night. In addition, slow wave sleep has been shown to be important for the learning of detailed information. So we can think of slow wave sleep as important for motor learning, motor skill learning, and for the learning of specific details about specific events. And this turns out to be fundamentally important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night. And motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night. And detail learning is occurring early in the night. I want to talk about REM sleep or Rapid Eye Movement sleep. REM sleep and Rapid Eye Movement sleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night. But you're going to have more of it-- a larger percentage of these 90-minute sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get toward morning. REM sleep is fascinating. It was discovered in the '50s when sleep laboratory in Chicago-- the researchers observed that people's eyes were moving under their eyelids. Now, something very important that we're going to address when we talk about trauma later is that the eye movements are not just side to side. They're very erratic in all different directions. One thing that I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly is why eye movements during sleep. Eyes are closed. And sometimes, people's eyelids would be a little bit open. And their eyes are darting around, especially in little kids. I don't suggest you do this. I'm not even sure it's ethical. But it has been done, where you pull back the eyelids of a kid while they're sleeping. And their eyes are kind of darting all over the place. Rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating and occurs because there are connections between the brainstem, an area called the pons, and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brainstem that are involved in generating movements in different directions, sometimes called saccades. Although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep, it's not just rapid. It's kind of a jittery side to side thing. And then the eyeballs kind of roll. It's really pretty creepy to look at if you see. So what's happening there is the circuitry that is involved in conscious eye movements is kind of going haywire. But it's not haywire. It's these waves of activity from the brain stem up to the so-called thalamus, which is an area that filters sensory information and then up to the cortex. And the cortex, of course, is involved in conscious perceptions. In REM sleep, serotonin is essentially absent. So this molecule, this neuromodulator that tends to create the feeling of bliss and well-being and just calm placidity is absent. In addition to that, norepinephrine, this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness, is absolutely absent. It's probably one of the few times in our life that epinephrine is essentially at zero activity within our system. And that has a number of very important implications for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep and the sorts of learning that can occur in REM sleep and unlearning. First of all, in REM sleep, we are paralyzed. We are experiencing what's called atonia, which just means that we're completely laid out and paralyzed. We also tend to experience whatever it is that we're dreaming about as a kind of hallucination or a hallucinatory activity. So in REM, our eyes are moving. But the rest of our body is paralyzed. And we are hallucinating. There's no epinephrine around. Epinephrine doesn't just create a desire to move and alertness. It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety. It's what's released from our adrenal glands when we experience something that's fearful or alerting. So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us or we get a troubling text message, adrenaline is deployed into our system. Adrenaline is epinephrine. Those are equivalent molecules. And epinephrine isn't just released from our adrenals. It's also released within our brain. So there's this weird stage of our life that happens more toward morning that we call REM sleep, where we're hallucinating and having these outrageous experiences in our mind. But the chemical that's associated with fear and panic and anxiety is not available to us. And that turns out to be very important. And you can imagine why that's important. It's important because it allows us to experience things, both replay of things that did occur as well as elaborate contortions of things that didn't occur. And it allows us to experience those in the absence of fear and anxiety. So we have this incredible period of sleep in which our experience of emotionally laden events is dissociated. It's chemically blocked from us having the actual emotion. So to just recap where we've gone so far, slow wave sleep early in the night has been shown to be important for motor learning and for detailed learning. REM sleep has a certain dream component in which there's no epinephrine. Therefore, we can't experience anxiety. We are paralyzed. Those dreams tend to be really vivid and have a lot of detail to them. And yet, in REM sleep, what's very clear is that the sorts of learning that happen in REM sleep are not motor events. It's more about unlearning of emotional events. And now, we know why. Because the chemicals available for really feeling those emotions are not present. Now, that has very important implications. So let's address those implications from two sides. First of all, we should ask, what happens if we don't get enough REM sleep? And a scenario that happens a lot where people don't get enough REM sleep is the following. I'll just explain the one that I'm familiar with because it happens to me a lot, although I've figured out ways to adjust. I go to sleep around 10:30, 11 o'clock. I fall asleep very easily. And then I wake up around 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I now know to use a NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest protocol. And that allows me to fall back asleep. Even though it's called non-sleep deep rest, it really allows me to relax my body and brain. And I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7:00 AM, during which time I get a lot of REM sleep. And I know this because I've measured it. And I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense of the sort that we know is typical of REM sleep. In this scenario, I've gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night. And I've got my REM sleep toward morning. However, there are times when I don't go back to sleep. Maybe I have a flight to catch. That's happened. Sometimes, I've got a lot on my mind. And I don't go back to sleep. I can tell you-- and you've probably experienced-- that the lack of REM sleep tends to make people emotionally irritable. It tends to make us feel as if the little things are the big things. So it's very clear from laboratory studies where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged. And we tend to catastrophize small things. We tend to feel like the world is really daunting. We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want. We can't unlearn the emotional components of whatever it is that's been happening, even if it's not traumatic. The other thing that happens in REM sleep is a replay of certain types of spatial information about where we were and why we were in those places. And this maps to some beautiful data and studies that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago showing that in rodents. And it turns out in non-human primates and in humans, there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep that almost precisely maps to the activity that we experienced during the day as we move from one place to another. So here's a common world scenario. You go to a new place. You navigate through that city or that environment. This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city. It can be a new building. It could be a finding particular rooms, new social interaction. You experience that. And if it's important enough, that becomes solidified a few days later. And you won't forget it. If it's unimportant, you'll probably forget it. During REM sleep, there's a literal replay of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred while you were navigating that same city or building earlier. So REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation of this detailed spatial information. But what is it that's actually happening in REM sleep? So there's this uncoupling of emotion. But most of all, what's happening in REM sleep is that we're forming a relationship with particular rules or algorithms. We're starting to figure out, based on all the experience that we had during the day, whether or not it's important that we avoid certain people or that we approach certain people, whether or not it's important that, when we enter a building, that we go into the elevator and turn left where the bathroom is, for instance-- these general themes of things and locations and how they fit together. And that has a word. It's called meaning. During our day, we're experiencing all sorts of things. Meaning is how we each individually piece together the relevance of one thing to the next. So if I suddenly told you that this pen was downloading all the information to my brain that was important to deliver this information, you'd probably think I was a pretty strange character because typically we don't think of pens as downloading information into brains. But if I told you that I was getting information from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you, you'd say, well, that's perfectly reasonable. And that's because we have a clear and agreed upon association with computers and information and memory. And we don't have that same association with pens. You might say, well, duh. But something in our brain needs to solidify those relationships and make sure that the certain relationships don't exist. And it appears that REM sleep is important for that. Because when you deprive yourself or people of REM, they start seeing odd associations. And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating. They literally start seeing relationships and movement of objects that isn't happening. And so REM sleep is really where we establish the emotional load but where we also start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant. And if you think about emotionality, a lot of overemotionality or catastrophizing is about seeing problems everywhere. It's very important in order to have healthy emotional and cognitive functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things. If we see something on the news that's very troubling, well, then it makes sense to be very troubled. But if we're troubled by everything and we start just saying, everything is bothering me and I'm feeling highly irritable and everything is just distorting and troubling me, chances are we are not actively removing the meaning, the connectivity between life experiences as well as we could. And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple the potential for emotionality between various experiences. And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship and similarity of REM sleep to some of the clinical practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma and other troubling experiences. Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatments such as EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, or ketamine treatment for trauma, something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine at a core level bear very similar features to REM sleep. So let's talk about EMDR first. EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, is something that was developed by a psychologist, Francine Shapiro. She actually was in Palo Alto. And the story goes that she was walking not so incidentally in the trees and forests behind Stanford. And she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind. So this would be from her own life. And she realized that as she was walking, the emotional load of that experience was not as intense or severe. She extrapolated from that experience of walking and not feeling as stressed about the stressful event to a practice that she put into work with her clients, with her patients, and that now has become fairly widespread. It's actually one of the few behaviorally-- the behavior treatments that are approved by the American Psychological Association for the treatment of trauma. What she had her clients and patients do was move their eyes from side to side while recounting some traumatic or troubling event. Why eye movements? Well, she never really said why eye movements. But soon, I'll tell you why the decision to select these lateralized eye movements for the work in the clinic was the right one. So these eye movements, they look silly. But they basically involve sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side for 30 to 60 seconds, then describing this challenging procedure. Now, as a vision scientist who also works on stress, when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly. People would ask me about EMDR. And I just thought, that's crazy. I went and looked up some of the theories about why EMDR might work. And there were a bunch of theories. Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep. That was one. It turns out that's not true. And I'll explain why. The other one was, oh, it synchronizes the activity on the two sides of the brain. Well, sort of. I mean, when you look into both sides of the binocular visual field, you activate the visual cortex. But this whole idea of synchrony between the two sides of the brain is something that I think modern neuroscience is starting to, let's just say, gently or not so gently move away from this whole right brain, left brain business. It turns out, however, that eye movements of the sort that I just did and that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience and brought to her clients in the clinic are the sorts of eye movements that you generate whenever you're moving through space, when you are self-generating that movement. So not so much when you're driving a car. But certainly, if you are riding a bicycle or you were walking or you were running, you don't realize it. But you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements that go from side to side. And they are associated with the motor system. So when you move forward, your eyes go like this. There have been a number of studies showing that these lateralized eye movements helped people move through or dissociate the emotional experience of particular traumas with those experiences such that they could recall those experiences after the treatment and not feel stressed about them. Or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer. Now, the success rate wasn't 100%. But they were statistically significant in a number of studies. In the last five years, there have been no fewer than five journals and papers showing that lateralized eye movements of the sort that I just did-- and if you're just listening to this, it's just moving the eyes from side to side with eyes open-- that those eye movements, but not vertical eye movements, suppress the activity of the amygdala, which is this brain region that is involved in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear. There are some forms of fear that are not amygdala dependent. But the amygdala, it's not a fear center. But it is critical for the fear response and for the experience of anxiety. So that's interesting. We've got a clinical tool now that indeed shows a lot of success in a good number of people, where eye movements from side to side are suppressing the amygdala. And the general theme is to use those eye movements to suppress the fear response and then to recount or repeat the experience and over time uncouple the heavy emotional load-- the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear-- from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic. This is important to understand because I'd love to be able to tell somebody who had a traumatic experience that they would forget that experience. But the truth is, you never forget the traumatic experience. What you do is you remove the emotional load. Eventually, it really does lose its potency. The emotional potency is alleviated. Now, EMDR, I should just mention, tends to be most successful for single event or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over and over as opposed to, say, an entire childhood or an entire divorce. It tends to be most effective for single event kinds of things-- car crashes, et cetera-- where people can really recall the events in quite a lot of detail. It's not for everybody. It's going to be done for trauma. It should be done in a clinical setting with somebody who's certified to do this. But that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, this experience in our sleep where our eyes are moving, although in a different way. But we don't have the chemical epinephrine in order to generate the fear response. And yet, we're remembering the event from the previous day or days. And then now, there's this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine, which also bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic. It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP, which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use. Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity of a particular receptor in the brain called the NMDA receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. This is a receptor that's in the surface of neurons or on the surface of neurons for which most of the time it's not active. But when something very extreme happens and there's a lot of activity in the neural pathway that impinges on that receptor, it opens. And it allows the entry of molecules, ions that trigger a cellular process that we call long-term potentiation. And long-term potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later, you don't need that intense event for the neuron to become active again. Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor. So how is ketamine being used? Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions very soon after trauma. Ketamine is being stocked in a number of different emergency rooms, where if people are brought in quickly-- and these are hard to describe even-- but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one next to them killed in a car accident and they were driving that car. This isn't for everybody, certainly. And you need to talk to your physician. But ketamine is being used. So they might infuse somebody with ketamine so that their emotion is-- it can still occur but that the plasticity, the change in the wiring of their brain won't allow that intense emotion to be attached to the experience. Now, immediately, you can imagine the ethical implications of this because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences. But in the clinical setting, the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies are really to remove emotion. Ketamine is about becoming dissociative or removed from the emotional component of experience. So now, we have ketamine, which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents the connection between an emotion and an experience. That's a pharmacologic intervention. We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing that is designed to suppress the amygdala and is designed to remove emotionality while somebody recounts an experience. And we have REM sleep, where the chemical epinephrine that allows for signaling of intense emotion and the experience of intense emotion in the brain and body is not allowed. And so we're starting to see an organizational logic, which is that a certain component of our sleeping life is acting like therapy. And that's really what REM sleep is about. So we should really think about REM sleep and slow wave sleep as both critical-- slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning, REM sleep for attaching of emotions to particular experiences, and then for making sure that the emotions are not attached to the wrong experiences and for unlearning emotional responses if they're too intense or severe. And this all speaks to the great importance of mastering one sleep, something that we talked about in episode two of the podcast, and making sure that if life has disruptive events, either due to travel or stress or changes in school or food schedules, something that we talked about in episodes three and four, that one can still grab a hold and manage one's sleep life because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions that are troubling to us is what allows us to move forward in life. And indeed, the REM deprivation study show that people become hyper emotional. They start to catastrophize. And it's no surprise, therefore, that sleep disturbances correlate with so many emotional and psychological disturbances. By now, it should just be obvious why that would be the case. I was in a discussion with a colleague of mine who's down in Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. I've known her for two decades now from the time she was at Oxford. And Sarah studies, among other things, menopause in the brain. And she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects of menopause actually are not directly related to the hormones. There have been some really nice studies showing that the disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause mapped to changes in sleep regulation that then impact emotionality and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits related to emotionality. So sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation of energy. It's not just deprivation of immune function. It is deprivation of self-induced therapy every time we go to sleep. So these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies are in clinic therapies. But REM sleep is the one that you're giving yourself every night when you go to sleep, which raises, I think, the other important question, which is how to get and how to know if you're getting the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. Turns out that for sake of learning new information, limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at least as important and perhaps more important than just getting more sleep overall. I find great relief personally in the fact that consistently getting, for me, about 6 hours or 6 and 1/2 hours is going to be more beneficial than constantly striving for eight or nine and finding that some nights I'm getting five and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean. Now, ideally, you're getting the full complement of slow wave sleep early and night and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep, which brings us how to get more REM sleep. Well, there are a couple of different ways. But here's how to not get more REM sleep. First of all, drink a lot of fluid right before going to sleep. One of the reasons why we wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom is because when our bladder is full, there is a neural connection, literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit that goes to the brain stem that wakes us up. So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep. The other one is tryptophan or anything that contains 5-HTP, which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin. Serotonin is made from tryptophan. For some people, those supplements might work. But beware, serotonin supplements could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. Now, if you want to increase your slow wave sleep, that's interesting. There are ways to do that. One of the most powerful ways to increase the percentage of slow wave sleep, apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning, is to engage in resistance exercise. It's pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone, which happens early in the night. And resistance exercise therefore can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep. It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime. In fact, for some people, the exercise could be disruptive for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes. But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise, does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep, which, as we know, is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine detailed information, not general rules or the emotional components of experiences. Alcohol-- alcohol and marijuana are well known to induce states that are pseudo sleep-like, especially when people fall asleep after having consumed alcohol or THC, one of the active components in marijuana. Alcohol, THC, and most things like them, meaning things that increase serotonin or GABA, are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep. They're going to disrupt the depth. They're going to disrupt the overall sequencing of more slow wave sleep early in the night and more REM sleep later in the night. That's just the reality. Now, of course, if that's what you need in order to sleep and that's within your protocol-- as I've said here before, I'm not suggesting people take anything. I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not a cop. So I'm not trying to regulate anyone's behavior. I'm just telling you what the literature says. Today, we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming, learning and unlearning. And I just want to recap a few of the highlights and important points. A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the night. More REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night. REM sleep is associated with intense experiences without this chemical epinephrine that allows us the anxiety or fear and almost certainly has an important role in uncoupling of emotion from experiences, kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night. That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR and ketamine therapies and so forth. Slow wave sleep is critical, however. It's critical mostly for motor learning and the learning of specific details. So REM is kind of emotions and general themes and meaning. And slow wave sleep-- motor learning and details. I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep, meaning getting six hours every night is better than getting 10 one night, eight the next, five the next, four the next. I find that fascinating. And I think I also like it because it's something I can control better than just trying to sleep more, which I think I'm not alone in agreeing that that's just hard for a lot of people to do. Thank you for joining me in this journey of the nervous system and biology and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness. It's really an incredible landscape to consider. And I hope that you're getting a lot out of the information. As always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Kelly starett Dr Kelly starett is a doctor of physical therapy and one of the world's experts in movement that is he teaches people how to move better for sake of sport for sake of recreational Fitness and and for everyday living today we discussed several important topics including how best to warm up for any and all workouts he also tells us how to improve our movement patterns for cardiovascular exercise for sport for resistance training across the board how to move better and how to improve our range of motion with the minimal amount of time investment we hear a lot about different forms of stretching we hear about Dynamic stretching we hear about passive stretching Dr stared explains how to improve our range of motion across our entire body in the best possible ways as well as how to offset or repair any imbalances that stem from muscular skeletal problems or from neural issues and how to reduce soreness how to improve our posture seated standing and movement-based posture we talk about nutrition so today's episode covers an immense amount of actionable information that I'm certain all of you will benefit from Dr Kelly starett has authored several best-selling books some of which you may have heard of such as Supple Leopard he was was actually one of the first people to become synonymous with the use of a lacrosse ball or foam roller but really even though a lot of people have talked about those what he was really doing there was to emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between the skeleton the muscles the nervous system and the fascia and today we also talk about fascia which is an incredibly interesting and important topic in addition to Consulting and coaching for various college level and professional athletes and teams Dr Kelly starett and his wife Juliet starett co-own the ready state we provide a link to the ready state in the show note captions there they have a plethora of useful information and actionable protocols I should mention years ago I took one of the courses from the ready State it's a really interesting course that we touch on some of the protocols from today it's all about pelvic floor so whether you're male or female and regardless of age understanding your pelvic floor how to take care of your pelvic floor in the context of exercise posture Etc is vitally important for all sorts of vitally important bodily functions so today we also touch on that by the end of today's episode I'm certain that you will be armed with a number of new highly actionable protocols I should emphasize these protocols take very little time and have an outsized positive effect on your movement your posture and your overall health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is 100% wild harvested venison from the island of Maui and it is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be consuming about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day that protein provides critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but it also promotes overall health given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to saave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories Maui newy venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that getting one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest in excess of calories also Maui venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth I personally like all of those in fact I probably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak responsible population management of the axis deer on the island of Maui means they cannot go beyond a particular Harvest capacity signing up for a membership is therefore the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomo to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's mauii venison docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing improvements in acne meaning reductions in acne reduceed pain and inflammation improved mitochondrial function fun and even improving visual function itself what sets Tu lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in specific combinations to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations personally I use the juv whole body panel about three to four times per week typically in the morning but sometimes in the afternoon and I use the juv handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju spell jv.com / huberman juv is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select juv products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get up to $400 off and now for my discussion with Dr Kelly Star at Dr Kelly Star at welcome thank you my friend been wanting to get you on here for a long time for many reasons not the least of which is that you've just pioneered so many areas of Health and fitness that I don't even know where to start frankly but let's jump in with the Big M with movement you're an expert in dissecting complex movement figuring out how people can move better and also figuring out how people who are doing what they think are simple movements are actually making their life either more complex or more painful than it needs to be so you're also known for helping people with so-called Mobility um which of course falls under the umbrella of movement and I can't see somebody do a foam roll or anything with a lacrosse ball where they're loosening up or talking about fascia without also thinking about you so that should frame today's conversation at least partially well to kick things off when you look at how most people sit walk and do their quote unquote exercise resistance training Andor cardiovascular hopefully and cardiovascular training what are some of the most common problems that you see is it imbalance like leaning to one side is it that their bodies are trained into asymmetry is there any way to kind of um you know Mass diagnose everybody all at once in this first question let me uh borrow a couple analogies from one of my favorite people Katie Bowman and first thing is she will point out and it's not a Perfect Analogy so bear with us is this notion of mechano transduction which means that at a cellular level your tissues some of your tissues specifically need mechanical input to express themselves you want a strong tendon how do you get a strong tendon you have to load it right does it do tendon things does it is it lengthening underload does it express shortening under load is do isometric holds so we can start at that level she points out that if you put a a again not a Perfect Analogy but if you put a an orca into captivity over a while that Orca fin will start to fold folded fin syndrome it's nicer than Flopper floppy fin syndrome that's hle and what you're doing is when you alter the environment that this amazing animal lives in it's not swimming it's not fighting it's not hunting you're not loading the base of that Fin and so what happens is that collagen breaks down and we start to see changes in that in that expression of that so what we can start to say is again not romanticizing the P toine era when human beings were paleo and but what is it that we need in our daily dose lives to maintain the Integrity of our tissue systems exposure so that our brain says this is safe so that you actually have tendons and ligaments that can do what tendons and ligaments can do and fascia that is can be springy if borrow another sort of kitty bism if we have a movement language an actual language made up of words how many words are you using today and most of us aren't using that many words so very few words so I sit I stand I walk very slowly I sit I stand I walk very slowly so everything is just in those few and then I go exercise using the same words I'm on the exercise bike right I'm on elliptical which doesn't actually ask me to have any hip extension and suddenly you can see that our movement language which we're really codifying under intensity load right we're coming very competent in these adaptation positions sitting what ends up happening well we start to see that our bodies or adaptation machines and they just begin to adapt and so suddenly what we have is a human body that doesn't Express normative range the brain may not think that that range is even safe and put there then we start to sort of minimize the movement choices that the brain has the movement options that the brain has so really the question is you know what low loads establish things at low loads and low speeds you can get away with everything why because this body is rad and it's designed it's durable It's Not Fragile it's designed to be ridden hard and put away wet for a long time remember when you were 17 we cut off your hand you would grow back the next day right you would think about the Falls you took skating and you'd be like ah that sucked the next day Put Your Shoulder back in you just kind of resawn so what is it that we need to put into our movement diet and then we can start to separate out should that be exercise or should that be movement and now the real filter that we should be beginning these real and Earnest conversations about is what is it in the environment given that I'm a busy working person and maybe I have some agency in the morning and maybe I have some agency in the afternoon but let's take exercise out of it the one hour discreet working on Zone 2 cardio working on right my evidence-based practice what should I be doing the rest of the time so for example one of the things that we're huge fans of the evening is sitting on the ground for 20 to 30 minutes in in what um uh cross layed um squatting yes um long sit side 99 anytime you need to fidget fidget what you'll see is you start to accumulate exposure which I think in my world view is the first order of magnitude in problem solving is how do we have the human be exposed to the thing we're trying to change or improve or restore normative ranges so that would be in the evening just getting down on the floor yeah that that behavior alone cultures that toilet on the ground sleep on the ground we start to see fall risk in our elderly population attenuate to zero approximate zero lower hip OA lower low back OA and it may just be that we're using and touching some shapes and our bodies are saying hey let's just keep that around let's let's let's normalize what the hip should be able to do in terms of you're a connective tissue think about you know the idea here is that we're we're loading you passively actively whatever that you're saying to your brain muscle you know this this is a quote from one of my PT instructors and this is really important if people take this away they should listen to this muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs at no age do you stop adapting at no age do you stop healing those things slow down it's a little bit harder to have the same adaptation we did we weren't in full-fledged puberty but you can always adapt in the first order of business if you spend 20 or 30 minutes sitting on the ground you're going to start to see that my hamstrings start to feel better my hips start to feel a little better because I'm just spending time in these ranges and my body is is going to start to adapt as I increase my movement language would you extend what you just said to um like if somebody has a hardwood floor and maybe a little um low pile rug or something like that and they're going to I don't know watch a podcast or a movie or show in the evening they stretch out and you know like on their on their belly like sort of up up dog or Cobra or whatever it's called so so basically any kind of movement where you're on the ground um any kind of um squatting stret and maybe they start to stretch a bit here and there oh so now we're into the real magic the behavior where are we going to stack these behaviors so if you have to get up and down off the ground plus one right I got to get up and down off the ground every day so if you're an older person who may hasn't gotten off the ground I'm older I'm just talking about over 50 you may not have gotten up and down off the ground for a hundred years you just don't do it anymore right we want to hear why I think MMA is so amazing you have to get up and down off the ground a lot right if you do go to Jets right how about yoga how about Pilates you're like wow there's a lot of time organizing on the ground so a lot of people Ida Ral really said Hey how do we help the person organizing gravity first and foremost right then we have someone like Philip Beach who is this incredible uh he wrote this book on functional embryology which I highly recommend called movement uh muscles and meridians I think muscles and meridians but his hypothesis is that one of the ways that the the body Tunes itself is by being on the ground again restoring native ranges reapproximating joints right kneeling walking and and if and if you just took a step back and said what's it look like for the last 10,000 years you know when have we 10,000 years ago my understanding is that I'm a little fatter your femur is a little longer but we're pretty much the same people maybe I don't digest milk yet maybe that's the understanding but ultimately what behaviors have changed we're off the ground and so this is an easy don't need any equipment can drop this in can answer my emails watch TV that seems like the how we're going to improve and be able to start to untangle this very complex coring not when people have a lot going on I love this um you and as you pointed out sorry the roller is already there so you're sitting there and the roller there another barrier to adherence knocked out so you're like oh might as well just what's stiff today what hurts today how could I have some self- soothing input and when we're working at high levels of performance like the highest levels these range of motion like keeping you being able to access the full sort of Arsenal of what you can do with your body these movement Solutions sort of like eedle portal plus the Olympics right you would see that this is an easy way for our leite athletes to work and integrate without having to do another thing so what I'm getting here is that everybody regardless of age should get down on the ground once a day and get up off the ground at some point you can use whatever you want to help you get up and down off the ground so those of you listening you're like I can't do that um you know there's a a test we we write about in the book um that if you just do crisscross applesauce standing you should be able to lower yourself to the ground and stand back up without using your hands okay so cross cross the feet just for those that are just listening cross the feet yep and then just slowly lower yourself into SE don't collapse just lower yourself to the ground and then without putting your hands down or knee down can you stand back up and should one be able to do with um either foot over the other seems like I should use my left leg and right leg equally right I shouldn't have a good side and a bad side but what's interesting is the data I think is that like it's a nice predictor of all cause mortality morbidity that's fine but what it really hints at is your changes in how your body interacts with the environment that because you've adapted suddenly this skill that you've done 100,000 times 200,000 times of the kids in crisscross applesauce you suddenly are confronted as an adult with a skill you can no longer perform and it doesn't require massive hip range of motion doesn't require full range of motion your ankles it's actually a really fair test but if you're missing some of these end ranges you're going to struggle and it's nice now that I have this like what's the session cost I'm become a I love cycling mountain biking Is My Jam but if I ride my bike a ton my hips get super tight but if I have some assessments just like Vital Signs blood pressure 120 over 80 that's not good blood pressure but it's a nice decent reference now I create some movement minimums that help me understand how my body is interacting with stress environment nutrition exercise etc for some people maybe me uh if I were to you know sit cross-legged on the ground for a bit um and then stand up oh yeah if it hasn't been in a while like kind of like just kind of ache but I consider myself pretty you know pretty mobile once I warm up I can run for an hour and a half jog for an hour and a half once I get warmed up in the gym I can move at what at least for me is is satisfying amounts of weight so I wouldn't say that I'm out of shape I wouldn't say I'm in spectacular shape is it normal for us after a certain age to kind of feel like we Creek or ache as we move in or out of a new movement I mean is that is that does it fit with being still a healthy person or should we just not have any of those kinds of like that was like I got to like that was rough that was super rough yeah maybe you know sitting for 30 minutes and standing up and feeling like you have to kind of open yourself up with a can open so to speak well a couple things there one is you said New Movement so one of the ways we Define best athlete is who's the person who can transfer the skill their current skill set and pick up the new skill the fastest so what I'll say is if you want to test how fit you are how good your program is go and jump someone else's program let me know how that goes can you perform the skills are are you skilled you're not I'm chuckling because I joined Cameron Haynes for his Weight Workout which is you know High repetition circuit work for that went on for about 45 minutes minutes none of the weights were particularly heavy but it's just non-stop I was sore and I normally don't get sore for more than a half day if if at all soreness hasn't really ever been an issue for me I was sore for almost a week and a half maybe two weeks like it was it was insane it was we're GNA this is so good opens up the next thing right uh founder of CrossFit Greg glasman one of my earliest influences coaches says we failed the margins of our experience so what you just saw was hey here is this metabolic pathway range work that I have not inoculated myself to and I think we're at an interesting place where Fitness has become hobby Fitness has become sort of my my personal Pastime and I can go to the gym and I can look jacked you're jacked in tan you're very handsome 49y old but what we start to see is the things that make us look aesthetically pleasing or I'm functional enough isn't the same thing is preparing for sport or transferring to new skill and in fact I would say if I had a a spectrum of activities I'd put like Fitness thing over here like I go to a camp I just do a million reps I Breathe hard it's super fun I'm in I'm in Zumba I like I'm miroring and I have positive regard and I see my friends on the other side we have very much Sports specific training the only goal is to support the sport if you're an elite soccer player we have goals offseason but in the in season it's to support your body to win but one step back from that i' call Sports preparation training which is where we start to see sort of some really pattern interference between what the internet says I should do to have huge quads and the best way to create an elite Sprinter or an elite footballer or right in that Sports preparation training I can be think of it gpp plus looking at positions and how things transfer a France Bosch is a great example of sports preparation training a Dutch thinker his books are great and you'll see understand that really what we're trying to do is in sports preparation is say hey what is this complex system in front of us what's the minimal amount of input so that we can still go and project ourselves into the world through Sport and performance and on the other side suddenly we we do come up confronted with hey I'm doing this thing and I jump in with my friend and I get brutalized which is actually a problem that we have with people really good fit athletes and I throw them into like a group fitness class and they can do so much work that they wreck themselves for weeks and that's probably what happened you're so strong and you know how to just be uncomfortable and you just did this freakish amount of work without giving yourself a chance to adapt and that happens all the time so going back to the um getting down on the ground once a day oh yeah um and then getting up um I'd like to just uh I want to get to Fitness and sports training as as well but um is there another practice or or set of practices related to where we do our profession work yeah so I can stand I have a standing desk I have a drafting table and I'll sit stand I'll stand for a while I'll sit stand for a while sit I have a stool I like to be at a stool that's where my back is not supported um and so I try and Vary it as much as I can and thanks to you I got um thanks to your recommendation that is I bought one of those little um kickstands that goes underneath the desk from Rogue I don't have any Financial relationship to Rogue I sent them you're making tens of dollars on this fidget stand I sent them I sent the money like everyone else would one could probably build one too this is a little fidget stand I love that thing cuz it reminds me to you know to to swing my swing my foot while I'm there while even while I'm standing so so that's what I've done to try and keep some Mobility during the day and I want to double click on that because that's really amazing because what you've done is said hey I can't control this aspect of my envir I have to do some deep work that means I might need to perch or I might have to sit at a conference table and then what we can start to say is well what other choices do I have and and now if we we work with a typical person and you say you have some agency before you leave work and then your agency doesn't return till you get home right what are you going to do during the day to keep the body moving right so that it's easier to escape to your afternoon class I think that's the the thing and what youve just described is what my wife would call A A movement- rich environment how do I pepper the environment with inputs so that I'm not just in a a tiny movement language I love that I want to go back to the sitting on the ground should it be painful should it be sore one aspect of your physiology that will not change doesn't have to change is your range of motion as you get older we should be able to maintain our range of motion so what's interesting is that if we suddenly confronted with tasks that ask us to be in certain positions that we're not comfortable with we're going to be sore you bet you're going to have to squeeze your butt and something you said earlier like once I'm warmed up I love that phrase right once I've had my 27 supplements and my coffee and my activation I've gotten into my sauna I can do anything I feel great the real question is should I have to do all that stuff for high performance absolutely but should I have to do all of this prep to have native range of motion to have Baseline range of motion probably not I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer well as long as we're there I'm just going to tell you what's worked best for me in terms of warming up um and I'd love to know your thoughts um years ago I think it was uh Charles poliquin post or something like that um where it was suggested to do relatively low repetition warm-up love it as opposed to going in and doing you know 15 reps then 10 then eight or whatever it is and I've found over the years what's allowed me to get strongest and stay strongest for me is to sure I'll go in and do the first set of a movement resistance training movement uh maybe eight repetitions just to get some blood flowing and remind my brain practice you know what what the range of motion is right then I'll do maybe just you know five four two repetitions on of subsequent three sets so five four and then two repetition sets with heavier loads and it's just to prepare my nervous system for heavier loads and then when I start my actual quote unquote work sets I can get a lot more real work done and this for me was like spit in the face of everything I had read everything i' had seen that you need to higher repetition warm up and it has allowed me to progress more or less continuously over the decades that I've been training and I'm not a natural athlete I'm just not I've trained for a long long time but I would never fall under what you would call like natural athlete I don't I have a low recovery quotient all that stuff and so for me it was like a shocker but it makes total sense prepare the nervous system for the work you're about to do and don't follow some preconceived idea that you have to do high repetition warmup or even moderate repetition warmup and lo and behold you get much stronger and if you want to grow muscle you can grow more muscle why haven't we heard more about this why don't people in Fitness talk more I know you do and please do talk about the nervous system and the fact that it's not just all about warming up and getting blood flow it's really about preparing the brain and spinal cord and all the stuff in there let's say couple variables there what's your training age right if I'm going to take a beginner and you and the same thing we can make big jumps you and I been we've deadlifted together a decade ago like we can just go know our bodies the patterns are well ingrained our tissues have exposure here right there's some things we can do so I love that you're starting to see that what's the minimal amount of warmup to to do the task and on some days you may be sore may be stiff and he takes a little more time to go get right underneath it one of the things I think we have this opportunity to do is put play back into warm-ups so one of the things is that I I suspect and please correct me if I'm wrong you don't find a lot of joy in do these like wrote a the world's greatest stretch why do the active like it's not that fun so what let me talk about my experience working with a team at at Berkeley I have this shout out to the Women's Water Polo team at Berkeley who are my just total family these women are incredible but I came into the sport and looked around and I saw really ineffective warm-ups that weren't a good useage of time that didn't prepare us to get into a fight in 20 minutes or 30 minutes later so if you went through your warm-up and said I'm going to be in a fight am I prepared for that or not and that's a nice like rubric to say I'm nervous system arousal I have a little sweat on I've practiced right you know you know I've touched some positions and shapes but you know what I see is that there's in the typical training session there's a lot of work to get done so now I think training is become very very dense you know here's this piece here's this piece now I do the successor work I got to hit these these card and so the warmup for me has been one of the last places where I can get you to explore new movements something you saw on the internet play around if you came to my gym you know or we came to my house now I'd be like let's go through the medicine ball for 5 minutes and there's no wrong way but I want you to start to explore speed I want you to explore catch an object and going fast and what we haven't done and I suspect I wouldn't say that your warmup is the best way i' say it's one way to get to the thing that we want faster and potentially you stop doing what didn't work and what didn't serve you which I really want people to understand is that if you're not blind going through some program I want you to say does this serve me because my experience working now 20 years with the best teams and athletes and organizations on the planet is athletes do what work and they stop doing what doesn't work isn't that interesting right so what I love is that you started to get under heavy loads relatively quickly in movements you had real competency and exposure with yes because what we want to do is come back to say what's the least amount of work I can do to have the biggest adaptation and 3 hours in the gym doesn't fit into your life and it doesn't fit into the typical person's life and theoretically you're going to have to go do a sport so you're going to have to recover from this Sport and this training session right you were like hey I can't even hand this high volume you know it's a ding on me too I can't handle the same high volume as my friends can so wasting your time in quotation marks with lots of high volume sets of an empty barbell might have been useful at some point and maybe it doesn't serve you as well now or because you have to put so many plates on that bar that's just that's a warm up by itself right that's not you walked a mile to load those plates no that's not an issue for me but that's a perfect what you just said is a perfect opportunity for me to mention something that I've noticed which prompts a question which is I noticed that I have some asymmetry my right shoulder naturally sits a little lower than my left and whenever I get a little back tweak it's always on the same side etc etc I know this this varies for for everybody and I noticed that I was always um picking up the the weights and racking them because I rerack my weights like a grown-up um racking them on the same side so I've made it a point now to to switch up you know which side I which side of my body I do them great um and notice I'm significantly weaker on one side of my body I mean not to the point where where you know I have to use two different sets of uh dumb or two different dumbbells if I'm doing curls or something but just noticing these natural asymmetry starting to show up because I'm a right-hander or who knows or I I skateboarded so you know I've spent a lot of my life early life with my left foot forward and my right foot pushing and as a consequence there are a lot of asymmetry so what I've tried to do is correct those asymmetries in the between movement movements but also to stagger my stance during curls and then and switch it each each time or maybe even overemphasize the weaker side I have no professional training in any of this I've just found that it's made for better posture more more evenly distributed strength and I must say all of that is based on teachings that I read in your books and through conversations with you about hey we have these natural imbalances and there are little things that we can do that take moments that can correct those imbalances so if if you would could you um sort of expand on the number and type of imbalances that you most commonly see and some ways for people to remedy remedy them excuse me Let's uh if we just took the word imbalance and put it to the side for a second because it's sort of a non-specific term like are we testing your hamstring to your quad like what what what's the ideal ratio here like if you're a professional pitcher I hope your arm right arm looks different than your left arm right but what we can say is number one imbalances don't necessarily cause pain let's let's be clear about that we should be using our time in the gym as training to find deficiencies and blind spots in our patterns in our skill in our you know and our our brains feeling comfortable with a certain movement and what you just hit was that it's boy it's really easy to get a lot of variability just doing the things I want to do anyway so now I'm in a tandem stance I I skate left foot forward right but you know suddenly that's my dominant stance if you're going to ask me to do anything of consequence I'm going to adopt that stance but suddenly I get to have some exposure here so what's the point of the gym what's the point of training just to work on some cardiorespiratory output you know that the science says is it to move into play is it to you know if the brain's a you know problem solving machine let's give it some problems to solve so you suddenly have a new problem to solve and I would even say that weakness isn't even the right idea just like here is a a pattern that I'm not as effective at as efficient at so when we go into the gym sort of with this great curiosity then it's a really rich place and really frankly the only safe place because there isn't contact and Sport and we're not fighting and dancing and moving and and we can really do this controlled formal movement where we can really see inputs and outputs I explained my mother-in-law a long time ago what was happening when we were developing our model to understand movement and I I was and I explained it and she was like Oh you mean it makes the invisible visible that's right is that this is a place to understand how your range of motion is changing how your skills are changing right over the course of a season or the course of you know something going on in your life a season in your life suddenly you're like wow my left hip is a little tight or my left shoulders my internal rotation is going away hard to see when you're swimming really easy to see when we dumbbell snatch right and what we're trying to do then is take the gym not only have it be a stimulus for adaptation but have it be a really great place to uncover changes in my movement changes in expression of that movement and so really what you see again if I just do this one thing over and over again that's patterning that's repetition that's practice right and what you've done is just said hey let me change my brain let me open the door handle with my left side and become coming into the gym with that Curiosity means that we can have seven bottom lines working on your fascia we're working on these Energy Systems we're working on these movement skills but simultaneously we can have fun we can work on understanding our range of I so for me I think it's easier to say let's let's frame Mobility as do here's the my definition do you have access to normative range of motion the range of motion every physician every physical therapist every chiro agrees on shoulder it's 180 degrees of flexion so for those listening This Is Lifting your arm above head so you can bring your your hand basically you know above the the center of your head and what you can see right now is Andrew has his elbow bent his hip head TI to the side is internally rotated he's solving the problem which is what his brain is saying compensation if you want to use the word compensation I want to put that on you but what I'd say is that's an incomplete position doesn't mean you have pain doesn't mean you're not the world champion but it means we may have some latent capacity we could Chase and the next question for me then is what is it that's missing potentially in your training that we're not having this exposure we're not doing enough close grip hanging we're not doing seesaw press right where the arm is straight up we're always gripping on a barbell right I'm not handling enough dumbbells or CLE Bells overhead and then we can say well do I need some position transfer exercises Mobility work to restore that so we can you use it again and then more importantly how does that turn up for you in a way that impacts your sport or your job that's what's really interesting does that make sense yeah so what I'm hearing is that when we go into the gym or wherever we do our resistance training work that we should think about it as a place to yes perform to exceed our previous um you know reps and sets and yeah because that's part of fun and easy to measure hard to see are you getting better at soccer I don't know but I put another K on my bench today like that's fun uh Lex fredman who of course everybody knows from The Lex Freedman podcast um likes to make fun of uh Americans cuz he's Russian but he's actually American now um for being Meatheads because we like to spend so much time in gyms working out as opposed to doing sports and I I assure him that I've also done and do Sports now but uh he likes to make that point and I think I think it's a fair one in that uh well he's a Brazilian jiu-jitsu guy so um in any event um the gym is also a place for diagnosis to to diagnose where we don't have as much range of motion as we could um and you know that's very helpful I think for people to hear because most people are are time limited they don't have if they're getting their you know two or three resistance training workouts per week plus two or three cardiovascular training workouts and they're listening to petera so trying to hang from a bar for you know 90 seconds or more and they're you know doing some farmer carries and they're doing their Zone too and they're throwing on a weight vest I me you know and they got either fidgeting under their desk you know at some point you can start to understand why people are like whoa this is starting to become overwhelming what you're talking about is going and doing your typical workout but paying attention to where some for lack of a better word I'll call them asymmetries or not full range of motion being expressed where that might be happening I love I keep coming back to this but this thing about getting down under the ground for 30 minutes each night while watching TV or while maybe even while eating dinner while talking to your family or partner I think it's fantastic it also gives me an excuse to push the the sofas off to the side of the room because I have this weird uh neuroticism about furniture in the middle of the room so I'm imagining getting mats on down in the down on the floor of the living room and suddenly we're not programming another thing that's I think one of the things that has happened and it's a good thing it's it's a feature of the system strength conditioning the last 20 years has become very sophisticated so Juliet and I my wife and CEO open our gym in 2005 this was the CrossFit gym the that's rightful location 21st CrossFit in the world early but we couldn't buy a kettle bell in San Francisco we had to drive to Santa Cruz that says a lot about San Francisco I can say that because I'm from the bay area but you they there was one place in San Cruz that sold him played against sports that import Ed these Russian kettle bells thank you pav and we had to make this Trek down to buy them so the fitness I think we I bought my first pair of Olympic lifting shoes out of the back of someone's car like a drug deal like Olympic lifting shoes yeah like you just couldn't buy them old shoes no like actually an Olympic lifting shoe with like a heel but like you can buy those at like three different stores in Malibu right now like you go right over there there's it's we have normal you can buy cleall at Target so the the world has become much more sophistic ated um sometimes like overhead Squad is a good example fantastic diagnostic tool tells us a lot so bar held overhead squat down super simple all you have to do is have normal range of motion and your your joints and tissues well it helps jul like to say I was bendy before I was big but you know the idea here though is let's go ahead and also put skill back into this but most people weren't overhead squatting you know at all it wasn't part of their language now everyone knows what an overhead squat is right Dan John CrossFit all the Olympic lifters have been doing this forever but what we are seeing is that the the Natural Evolution of fitness and strength and conditioning is that we've become we've gotten really decorative in our room so we create this room that's just every inch has a knickknack has an assistance this is my tib Rays this is my neck thing it's a very decorative experience and instead of asking what was essential in terms of energy systems and positions that I can train so that I could go use those credits you know for lack of a better word it's Fitness has become very recursive I have this zone two so I can do more zone two so I can more zone two or I have pull-ups because they be get more pull-ups instead of well how did that make you swim what's the minimum amount of time we can spend in the gym so that you can go Express that Lex is right in a sport or an activity and look there are times in your life for the gym is the only thing you got you know Julet and I when we had two kids and a baby or two kids in our our businesses we did the 10 10 10 at 10 which is like 10 air squats 10 cball swings 10 pull-ups at 10 p.m. for 10 minutes and I was like Elite my fitness is Elite you do that every day well I just did it when I could do it right because that's all I could fit in so you know I think what's happened is we have now sold people this idea that Fitness happens in a one-h hour block and if it's not an hour you know then it's not worth doing and if you kept a bar loaded in your garage you could walk out there and do sets in between making dinner you kept a c on your kitchen you could do pavles four swings on the minute for 20 minutes and at least have some exposure loading so a long way around the barn of saying I want to protect your gym time because it's really sacred amazing time where you can have fun explore ranges get strong get jacked feel great about yourself interact with your friends and what I don't want to do is encroach anymore on that magic time because we have a lot to get done in the gym physiologically if we're going to compete against these other teams we're going to beat Stanford we're going to need to really maximize that time in the gym so that means we need to push out some of these other behaviors so we're not stacking them in and they're eroding the time we could be squatting or benching or cleaning or running or sprinting or cutting or playing you mentioned warming up with play which I think is a wonderful concept um and presumably brings about more Dynamic movement 100% um and another reason I like it is that I loathe warming up aside from the types of warm-ups that I just described and I hate it and I'm beginning to realize that um the way I've been training even though it's been um I would I would say useful and and uh successful for where I've been uh I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do heading into the new year this is not like a New Year's episode this this is a you know Evergreen because it's you um but we have a new year coming A lot of people are are going to naturally Mark the time during and after the holidays as a transition point and if one want wanted to start to not necessarily completely re restructure their Fitness but wanted to start incorporating a few things so we've got sitting down in the evening for 30 minutes we've got incorporating play into the warmup what would that look like are we taking a tennis ball and bouncing it off the ground we setting some rule in playing a game sure what if I'm alone am I um am I playing a little little handball type game against the wall absolutely see something on the Internet want to learn a new skill this is the time to put it in uh I'm going to talk about my brilliant friend David W he has something called rope flow that he created and it's just a piece of climbing rope and he will talk about all the things that will do for me I get a thousand PNF patterns I tie my upper body into my lower my upper body into my lower body I get you explain PNF sorry acronym sorry sorry everyone that's a a model of facilitating movement developed at Kaiser Vallejo It Is by not and cabat I think uh maybe I'm getting confused using those and anyway the the bottom line is this how do we help the body restore Movement by using its own positional awareness got it so if you've ever done a hamstring stretch where someone holds you and you resist that contract relax is a style it's a technique born out of PNF got it sorry to interrup okay so he's got these ropes and and so suddenly like I use this with all my teams is suddenly I'm spinning ropes I'm getting thousands of evolutions of the wrist turning the elbow turning the shoulder turning I'm generating speed in weird positions that would be vulnerable and not as effective at high load high stakes I get to twist I can tie my eyes into it I can develop my stance and in five minutes of messing around you're like H I feel good and we've added some speed to that right because a lot of the warm-ups I see people do I'm like hey there was no speed you know what sport is speed and you haven't added any velocity to your training so where are we going to do that I love this um I'm excited to Dave Dave wack does a lot of amazing things his rope is a foundational piece of mind if you work with me and you have shoulder pain and neck pain you're going to get my shoulder spin up or David WX rope flow every day that's part of our our homework what are we going to do to give you exposure and restore what you're supposed to do with your body so walk into the gym use the bathroom hydrate whatever it is you need to do and then five to 10 minutes of some Play Type Dynamic activity throw a medicine ball around jump on a mini trampoline pick up a barbell do a complex do some breath hold work this a perfect place to lay on all the breath hold work I think they call it dry face breath holding right this this Dynamic apnea work where you're basically holding your breath so for example with our teams we try to I try to have this is a magic number seven sort of hypoxic events where we do something on a breathhold until the athlete has a crisis and has to breathe and part of that is I want to get the brain ready for these high CO2 levels right and I want to challenge respiration and it's so easy get on the bike here's something everyone can do for five minutes I want you to take a 10-second inhale on the bike hold your breath as long as you can when the bomb goes off in your face recover nose only start at the next one at the next minute and what you're going to see is wow that was really uncomfortable really psychologically preparing myself to get into a fight that came from the French free divers one of the coaches I was working with was like here's something we used to do with our with our French free divers I was like this is so good McKenzie lar Hamilton Wim hooff the people who've been exposing us to Dynamic apnea work is amazing but that's another example of something I can do instead of mindlessly just being on and I got to get a sweat like let's go ahead and just layer in play and destruction I love it do not lay on the ground of foam roll let me say that again do not lay on the ground FAL that is the worst way to get ready for a fight ever I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical IAL and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy green and supplementing with Knack and acetyl cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night that's truly the Foundation of all mental health physical health and performance and one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3 degrees eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation of the Pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and even has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your airf flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover go to eights sleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman somehow I we could talk about how it's not a coincidence um you became synonymous with foam rolling it be synonymous with you that's okay it's uh I mean it's not it's okay with me they weren't saying about me but I was about to say it's okay you know anytime somebody um goes public facing and starts to to try and educate people you know people there are certain things that are sticky they have like high salance like um yes I like to get into a cold plunge but how I how Andrew huberman became associated with cold plunging or buying a gold blung is is wild I mean sure I own one and you know this sort of thing and I think they're great for shifting your state um but it's hardly the Cornerstone of my life or or my um existence but I love it I I use it but I think foam rolling I think looked different enough from what people had not seen before and it you know these things just they have a stickiness to them who who knows why um what is the deal with foam rolling is is there utility to foam rolling absolutely um is there a wrong way to do it no but there's a way that's not a great use of your time okay right so what we're all looking at is we have fin out amount of time and what's my goal to quickly touch my whole body you know what what are we trying to do so if I was using soft tissue mobilization and or using a rooll or or a ball or something what's my goal here well I think in the research is very clear it can help with pain it can restore range of motion again very clear and I want to point out sort of one of my research friends Brent Brook Bush the brook Bush Institute has incredible summaries of muscular skeletal care Brent is a genius and if you go on his site there's a little hourglass and you can search like trigger points and you'll see all of the Deep dive research analysis of the meta research like you you'll be like okay this is really excellent and and it is tricky because you know what doesn't work for my body or wasn't a good use for a time now is useless and it's easy to shout on the internet so what's our goal if I was in pain and I was about to exercise a a quick two or three minute intervention working on let's call it desensitization of the tissues let's let's be mechanism agnostic for a second and say that's a really low level to entry safe highly effective way for you to suddenly feel better so we create a window of opportunity to move that's really cool I love that no physical therapist in the room no one went blind you didn't dislocate right so that could be a really excellent use of some soft tissue work the same way a boxer would go or MMA fighter or the Olympic lifters in China they have people who are giving non-threatening input to the body to tell the brain it's safe or to rehydrate something or get some not again is it just stimulus so that the brain says it's safe sure are we restoring how the tissues slide and glide sure a lot of times I think if you look at any of the mobility work I'll just put r large really comes down to just doing a couple things most of them are just isometrics so we have a lot of isometrics which everyone can agree is good stuff and we do a lot of tempo work that's really just moving slowly through range it just may be that I'm using a different tool to have that isometric stimulus or that that Tempo moving slowly stimulus so we like to say hey let's use mobilizations mobilizing the tissues why are we doing it what are we trying to do well pain is a good reason and again multifactoral highly subjective why do I have pain while I got in a fight with my wife and I didn't eat and I you know twisted my knee back in Vietnam and you know who knows right but what are the inputs that I have to self sooth and desensitize and it turns out a ball and a roller is a really good one so I can use those to help myself feel better did that solve the problem did that solve two weeks of shitty sleep did that solve my poor nutrition and lack of fiber that solve the fact that I don't feel safe in this environment no but it got me a window of opportunity where I can go feel better in my body is anyone against that no okay so what we can also say is hey this would be a great way to do what restore your range of motion a one tool and a system of tools to get you to do what have normative range again right for whatever reason your last are super stiff you're doesn't again it's more complicated than that but sometimes it's not more complicated than that and if I just get you getting some input into there maybe I can restore that range of motion or create a window where you can go use it again lastly I would say is it it's a wonderful tool to decrease Doms delayed onset muscle soreness so in the evening you blew out your quads do a little soft tissue work and what you'll see is maybe that's blood flow maybe it's non-threatening input maybe it's just massage Maybe maybe it's just the parasympathetic input that massage has touch right just downregulates maybe those are the reasons I feel better but the bottom line is is that a good use of your time yes or all techniques on the rul the same no right and I think that's where we've lost our minds is that if you you just rolled up and down in your Cal didn't do anything I'm like yeah well you just what are you doing right what if I rolled side to side and so suddenly we can start to layer in some really complex thinking around this how about this you you have a roller out and I put my calf on there and I start rolling side to side should that be uncomfortable I'm guessing you're going to say no but um any anytime I've used a roller anytime I've used a roller I'm like man that hurts I don't that sucks I well I mean I don't mind it like it's not like the kind of it's not like level level eight pain or anything it's just it's sort of like it feels very localized Even If the roll is a big fat Costello the Bulldog size rollert it feels like someone's kind of kneading down in between my muscle fibers and then I start to think maybe I just have like low fiber density and if I were Mark Bell or something then this would feel comfortable but you know I I always feel like the roller is going down to the boat face of lfd blue fiber density so you know what I think we can do is let's establish some some some guideliner people cuz this is this is one of the ways that we can feel better on our home without bourbon without ibuprofen without THC like we need to give people some tools that don't like that aren't just without having to buy a sauna if you can afford one great but not every I mean this whole thing with sauna love saunas but you know well until very recently in my life like I couldn't afford a sauna until very recently you know even as a 10-year professor at Stanford I'll just say that right you can actually be angry at your parents for not giving you a sauna no you know when I was a kid my dad and I used to go to the Y in the evening sometimes when I was little and I'd shoot baskets or he would he would lift weights Nautilus machines back then and then um we get and then we'd sit in the sauna or there was aot you had a different set of trauma traumatic experience of sitting in the S the why no actually I learned how um I learned how how men uh I learned how men uh over over 40 spoke in 19 855 there you go there you go there you go if everyone had a roller and a ball there was a lot of dysfunction and discomfort we can manage if you push on a tissue we expect that tissue to be painless to compression or un not uncomfortable to compression again don't pain is a weird word I don't want to set that up but you shouldn't be uncomfortable to compression what's nice is that if I push on something all I'm doing is just creating an isometric it's just a vector isometric instead of pulling an isometric through the length of the tissue I'm putting it in a different vector and angle so that would just be one I could start there and if it was uncomfortable well guess what now I can get my my nervous system involved so I can teach my brain that it's safe to create a contraction here so what do I do just Flex Flex it hold it for 4 seconds this is very basic I realize but for many people they're either already foam rolling and doing it incorrectly or they're not foam rolling we want them to do it correctly so if I understand correctly it's quote unquote okay to flex the muscle that you have in contact with the foam roller while you're rolling if I find something that's uncomfortable or stiff or doesn't feel like my other side I'm going to stop found a place to work I'm going to build take a big inhale so I take a 4 second inhale I want to teach myself that I need to be able to breathe in this position my one of my you know friends Greg Cook is like if you can't breathe in position you don't own a position you know that sounds very iang guard too but what we're going to do is we're going to say it's okay to breathe here and I'm going to contract here and then I'm going to slowly relax and soften that's Tempo that's moving slowly and I can handle higher loads and what'll end up happening is if I repeat that cycle two or three times guess what my brain desensitizes that changes range of motion my brain suddenly is like that's not a problem anymore so we just move on and in two or three cycles of that contraction breath hold long exhale that starts to sound familiar right how do I come down long exhales I'm not trying to spin up I'm trying to say this is this is safe I've done that with my breath I've done that with contraction I'm just getting input in just just touch to my body especially on parts that maybe don't bark at me very often right people are shocked to learn that sometimes when they have knee pain how stiff their quads are and we can test it load it feel it palpate it and I'm like those things are just stiff and when we unstiffen them whatever technique you want to use restore sliding surfaces get neural input in there we create range of motion suddenly we change a motion dynamic improved efficiency the brain says hey that's no longer a threat or we're experiencing that as a new pattern or position that' be enough to reduce your pain but pain isn't the only reason we're mobilizing we're mobilizing so that we can reduce session cost so we can work out harder the next day and keep an eye on our minimums of our of our range of motion love this and um another just very basic question because I'll be honest I haven't foam rolled much in my life um and and it doesn't have to be a big fo everyone sometimes those big white those are pool noodles right that's what it was for I think like made in Colleen Texas is like a manufacturing byproduct and someone's like we could put these in the pool and then some physical therapist is like sweet like that thing's way too big and too hard and too square and too soft like there's a whole bunch of things like sometimes you need an elbow sometimes you need a forearm sometimes you need a thumb so you can have much smaller diameter I'm a much bigger fan of smaller diameter rollers I just think they fit your body better thank you for that um also very helpful um let's say I want to quote unquote loosen up or um or move out some potential soreness or soreness from a given U muscle uh like the quadricep does it make sense to start in the middle of that muscle the top like does it can you work above and below the the the knee um are all of those things going to help I realize this is a a much Fuller discussion than we can have in a few minutes like how should I approach I'm like okay you know my my uh quads are a little sore my or my back is sore do I go straight to the back or do I start with another with another body region I don't think it matters what I want interested is inputs and outputs right what I'm really interested in is what did you do to make yourself feel better did you just hope it would just go away and then when day it didn't and then you had to activate the emergency medical system so let's define a couple things what is an injury this is a great question injury for us is there's a clear mechanism of mechanical trauma there's a bone sticking out of your leg Andrew time to go to the hospital injured right you're injured right I heard a snap and a pop yikes I have night sweats dizziness fever vomiting nausea unaccounted for weight loss weight gain changes in my bladder bowel function problem my cough sneeze or swallow those are red flags you're not sore you're sick let me introduce you to the doctor again right if your pain or dysfunction is so bad you can't occupy a role in your family can't occupy a role in society can't occupy a role in the team that's emergency problem that is a medical condition that needs medical so you come in today you tweak your back it may need we need to activate EMS need to go to the hospital we need to get because it's so severe you can't do your job everything else I want to call non-injury I want to be very specific with the language he is we call it an incident it actually comes out of this um sort of language there's a a guy here here's the long way around the barn I read this great book called Deep survival which is Lawrence Gonzalez which is about why people end up in survival situations and it's a literally a lot about like we got away with it for a long time and then I just didn't have a you know I ended up two miles out sea I've done it a million times and this time right that's it but there was a footnote in there from a book called normal accidents by Charles pero who's recently passed on I emailed Charles because I was like this has blown my mind he calls A lot of times will have trivial events in non-trivial systems so he's taking systems think thinking he's looking at complex system organization and his idea is that an accident a normal accident is actually just expression of the system if you gave the system long enough to express itself the inputs and outputs are so tightly coupled that it's difficult to see what causes what and how they influence each other that's the body so your stiff shoulder isn't a problem until you fall in the ice and then that stiff shoulder suddenly can't take over pressure and overhead and you tear your rotator cuff off at high speed you'd say Oh Black Swan event super crazy but that's actually just a normal expression of that shoulder system if we gave it enough time to express itself so he has sort of like incident an accident so an incident is I want us to start to think about incident level problems are pain loss of range of motion numbness tingle we're becoming curious why is the brain sending me the signal it's pain is a request for change so when if we ask our athletic populations I just did this with a hundred kids I'm like how many of you are pain free 100 high school kids two hands go up two high school high school so what we're suddenly realizing is that pain is very much a part of the athletic condition The Human Experience certainly the athletic experience you've been in pain a billion times and still gone out and done the thing so what we we want to do is say pain is not always a medical problem it's a medical problem when the the time we're saying how are you using Fitness training as a scaffolding to understand nutrition hydration soft tissue work desensitization reperfusion of the tissues so that's what we're trying to do in sport and training is Empower people to say what's going on with my body and why don't I feel the way I do or why does something hurt and why can't I remedy that and then when I run out of ideas let me go get some help so the the rolling um we can think of as a way to you know move out soreness prepare us for more work the next day or something like that but is it fair to say that we can also use the roller as a diagnostic tool sure like if I'm feeling like an unusual amount of of um not unusual but let's just say um that I'm feeling like a wuss cuz when I when I lie down on that roller and I kind like you know like slide back and forth like I've seen the videos of you and other folks doing that I'm like man that really hurts does that necessar mean something's wrong okay no it mean it means that for whatever reason those tissues become sensitized and that your brain is interpreting that stiffness as a threat and it's reading it as pain right and some people they don't have that they just their tissues feel like this but they don't have pain when they do that but that's not a normal tissue you should be like layers of warm silk sliding over steel Springs and what you're seeing is that what is that what quality tissue should absolutely that layers silk over steel Springs layers of silk over steel Springs and what we see is that we are loading and training at such high intensity it's in such density now that our tissues get stiff I'm just going to hang stiffness as for whatever reason FIB high fibrotic high density of tissues whatever reason the tissues don't behave the way the joint system should right and that's a problem because my training shouldn't mitigate or attenuate or change my range of motion it can but now how am I keeping an eye on those changes or as you said earlier as I do a sport and I start to do a sport and specialize I'm throwing throwing or I swim or I kick on one side how can I start to identify as my body is changing and adapting that sport so I can drag myself back to a sort of a greater Readiness and that's one of the reasons that that mobilization tool is such a powerful tool again however you want to do it I think it's useful for for us when we have we I came up with this thing called the D2 R2 model because the other Ray was taken R2-D2 so the first order of business is I want to desensitize if something hurts something hurts let's desensitize it I can do that all different ways scraping is powerful desensitization isometrics can be really useful uh rolling bfr can give me desensitization there's so many techniques to make my body restriction yeah Blood Flow Restriction so that no longer I'm my brain is perceiving this as a threat because if you're pain you cannot generate the same amount of force or wattage or output and your brain is going to start to truncate it's going to start to Lop off your movement Solutions right it's just going to happen so we want our we want everyone to be saying hey we don't panic we have pain we just treat it like another diagnostic tool then second d right we desensitize and then we ask is this something that be decongested so decongestion means that often times tissues that are swollen become more easily sensitized tissues that are swollen and congested don't heal as fast if you have a swollen ankle those collagen fibers will not knit together as fast as a right if you have a joint that's swollen or a tissue that's swollen your brain will shut down Force production in and around that joint system is swelling an emergency no is a swollen joint environment really healthy for the the integrity and surface of the joint no we want to manage that but often times when someone comes in and the tissue is congested right just sometimes we say swelling and we think ankle right only capsular but here we have if you've ever flown on an airplane and had cankles those that's congested tissue if we manage that congestion if we move those lymphatics along we muscle contraction drives the lymphatic drainage the the lymph system is the sewage system of the body decongested tissues often express less pain and what we find is that in broken bones or soft tissue injuries if we can better evacuate that swelling better evacuate that congestion not only do we see you now healing at the rate of a human being we're not rate limiting the healing but also we can help you manage that sensitivity then the third one is can we get some blood flow in there like H you said I once I warm up I feel great welcome to the power of blood flow tissues become hydrated we're shifting blood from the stomach all the things that happens right all that Venus return is coming back on board but suddenly we see that if we get something pumped full of blood it tends to be less painful and that's a really easy so if I have an old Orthopedic thing maybe I spend a few few minutes just getting a huge quad pump on the leg extension machine then I go squat heavy right so I have desensitization decongestion reperfusion whatever tool you want to use for these is fair game with me just is how I've come to kind of conceptualize these different tools and the last one is restore do you have full range of motion full normal in that joint yes or no because that's the last thing that we talk about because you're still able to perform your sport at college or do your job but we're not seeing how inaccess your ability to not access that range of motion maybe limiting your movement choice and potentially overloading a tissue and a by making it work in a less effective manner or even just leading to progressively worse and worse posture sure which is probably well Define define posture form me because I think that's a really great place to start right yeah I can Define bad posture as when you catch yourself in a in a reflection and you realize wow I'm starting to I'm starting to look more like a c I love than than a than a not that's so great you the question is is that a matter of Aesthetics or pain well uh certainly for me it's not pain but you know I it's not becoming injury I notice that um it's not becoming I I notice that unless I pay attention to my posture while sitting unless I do a um you know like Bridge my fingers together and pull my my chin back a few times a day that I'm just naturally starting to tip over forward towards my text messages that aren't even in my hands right now and I think this is you know the the younger generation I mean now that I'm 49 I can talk like like that right I mean it's St you the 1900s they are late 1900s exactly they're they're starting to look like a they're shaped like a sea that it's um and I'm a big believer in uh people especially men doing neck work I feel like like if if you especially how about especially people doing that work yeah well here's the thing anytime I I'm happy to go go there with this one um maybe even at the risk of being Politically Incorrect anytime I've suggested that women also do neck workor they say no you should see my goalie daughter because for every pound stronger your neck is your reduction in concussion risk drops huge a pound thank you so we keep the iron neck by the door and she walks in and there's a we have a video in our family where she's doing her iron neck train she looks at me she's like Dad this is why I don't have a boyfriend thank you sorry Caroline but that's the way it goes right cuz she's like look at me I look like an idiot but she loves having a big strong neck that doesn't can take the shot from the ball yeah listen I wish everyone would train their neck I had I had an accident where I fell off a off a roof walked away from it my neck was sore but I heard it and felt it and I was like oh goodness but it was actually from skateboarding stuff and falling and that I started training my neck years ago and realized that wow when I train my neck I'm one of the few people in my TR age cohort that doesn't complain about shoulder pain now maybe I don't have full range of of motion um maybe I'm hanging out with the wrong people but anytime I see a somebody with really broad shoulders where their neck is is really inside of their jawline it looks like a head was placed on the wrong long action fig your body I just want to go over to them and say listen a it's aesthetically ridiculous it it looks like one of those flip books in the kids where you can change the head the body and the and the legs to be different animals um more seriously it's a hazard because it's your upper spine it's clearly not in line with the rest of your your strength profile and the other one is the more incentive based thing is Hey listen if you train your neck everything else gets stronger and your head and your brain is going to be safer and as a neuroscientist they usually listen to the last piece so I I so I'm so glad we're talking about this I I do Bridges I know that they can be risky with tongue in the roof of my mouth I like I do Bridges to the back and then I I do have a four-way neck machine or I use a plate uh Jeff Cavalier's got a great video of how to do this that we can link too how to do it safely you got to you got to close the Chain by having a hand on the ground this kind of thing to do it safely but I've just found that neetwork also serves posture it posture serves the ability to make eye contact when you have those things we call conversations with people in real life and I do think it these things stack up to we won't call it like psychological confidence but the ability to meet somebody you know like firm handshake you know trying to crush the other person's hand look people in the eye stand up straight whatever your height these things really matter in subtle ways or not so subtle ways I think that I do feel like like yes that the younger generation and the older generation they they sort of drop they kind of drop out of certain Elements of Life if you're looking down at the ground at your phone all the time you can't look people in the eye you're posturally not right you're in pain you're not as strong as you could be I mean these things stack up to being um like in a in an aquarium full of fish um you're becoming the fish in the background that's like you know like was kind of sickly and the other fish are getting all the the good stuff and you know if you define posture as like the Latin word route is position so we're really saying is I have good position I have bad position who I have bad position one of the ways I think we've lost the narrative a little bit is we try to give people these extrinsic cues to correct their posture shoulders backing down check your tint like so all of a sudden you're like when am I going to be a human being and how do I practice this when I'm doing a complex skill so the organization of your body the organization of your spine particularly really is a reflection of your movement habits your behaviors your self-identity there's a lot of things in there right you didn't get the job you won the you got the number from Juliet or your sleep deprived you and I'm going to call myself out people are going to do there many times on this podcast when I go and I look at the because I do listen to the podcast trying and see places I can improve Etc um and I'll be like wow my posture I'm like hunched over and I think to myself and I'll go you just reflecting my posture no no and I track my sleep so you know I'll go back and look I'll be like yeah I wasn't sleeping as well those days or or what whatever it is right I I mean I think that we're we are all guilty of not paying enough attention to our posture so what we can do is we could Define posture is there is a median range of the joint positioning where we simultaneously have most access to our physiology right and I'll explain that little more but also those shapes aren't associated with increased pain risk and increased injury risk which is real the research does bear that that there are positions and shapes that lead to less effective movement and more likely to experience pain it's probabilistic it's not guaranteed it's there more likely so one of the things that I I think you could you could understand is hey do you want to have access to all of the Machinery so go ahead and slouch go ahead with me and then just turn over your shoulder how far can you turn yeah now very far now watch this get into a position where you take a huge breath get to the biggest position you take the biggest breath okay so that's a pretty rocking shape now turn your head goes further so by you being queued can you adopt a shape an organization of your trunk that allowed you to ventilate a little bit more effectively you completely change and reorganized your structure which led to an improvement and output so when I'm working with people there's only two things I really can wrap my head around one is do you have normative range of motion yes or no what are the tools we have to restore that and improve that and does that expression give us greater biomotor output because those are objective measures when biom motor output I mean range of motion Force production power right I see that in I can express the phys physiology in a unique way that makes me you know more effective and that is why you'll see suddenly we have this definition that is maintaining the physiology and aspects I'm not going to have as good shoulder flexion with my arm over ah head as when I'm was sitting up taller or in a position where I can take a bigger breath and I think that's what's really great because that gets us away from good posture bad posture into hey that position doesn't serve you as well in these circumstances and in this position I'm working with the par rescue team in the Air Force the number one reason they were having back injuries was getting this litter out of the helicopter because they have a litter the soldiers there with all their gear on they've got a lift from a totally weird flexed position right and this just turns out it's not a really effective posture position shape that transfers to handing this higher loads so what do we do we work on the range of motion we give them skills to try to organize more effectively shape and lo and behold we can reduce injury risk and injury incident in those soldiers right so what we're always thinking about here is let's get away from good and bad and like posture doesn't matter and it also doesn't matter at low load low speed and I want to be very clear about that so you can get away with murder at low velocities and low speeds but speed kills oh everyone's fine but when that speed wobble starts to happen we start to see greater likelihood of deflection from posture your abs don't work as effectively you can't create the same inch abdominal pressure right check check check check check so that's why we always are saying hey is this true that you're saying under high load high speed when there's consequence because maybe this set of conditions Works under these conditions but it doesn't work across all conditions and for me I'm trying to take the best information I have working in sports and performance and trying to transmute that to my family transmute that to my neighborhood and to the kids I'm working with I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need but nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium all in the correct ratios but no sugar proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it extremely easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element they have watermelon Citrus Etc frankly I love them all and now that we're in the winter months in the northern hemisphere element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock I really like the chocolate flavors especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up so you put it in hot water and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate especially when it's cold and dry outside when hydration is especially critical if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman laab to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman laab to claim a free sample pack as long as we're talking about posture feels like a good transition point to pelvic floor years ago and this is a plug for the the material that you put out online and in books but long before we met um I decided to sign up for your men's pelvic floor course out sold our women's pelvic floor course two to one it was so interesting because you know at that time um one could go online and learn a little bit about pelvic floor everyone and we talked about this um with a couple different guests on this podcast including the um director of M male sexual health um he's an MD PhD or at least an MD as I recall Mike Eisenberg at Stanford we talked about this with Mary CLA Haver and other people in the female health I'm glad we're normalizing this conversation yeah we normalized this conversation you know that the pelvic floor is Rich with vasc for blood flow and neural input for controlling muscles either passively or actively and I'll tell you the number of people I know who have urinary issues sexual dysfunction issues oh um I know because they tell me that they squat heavy in the gym they do their keyles and things like that then I've had guests on like Mike Eisenberg and others and they say um yeah actually um if you have a tight pelvic floor doing kulls is about the worst thing you could ever do for urinary function or um ere erection function that's right you know because you're sending it in the wrong direction you need to learn to relax your pelvic floor then um some women will say and it seems to be women that report this whether or not men just have this but don't report it I don't know I've had people write to me and say yeah you know I'll do um some lower body work in the gym and some urine is sneaking out and it's like well pelvic floor and you had this great course on pelvic floor that taught me among other things um I and I will say I wasn't suffering any of those particular issues but I had prostate pain in my 30s and I was like what's going on when and got my PSA measured perfectly normal thought what's going on started researching online read your work and realized oh I think I might just have tight pelvic floor started doing certain things including you taught me how to sit down and stand up correctly in this video it's like you have to keep your sternum high right you s I think said it was like a stately stately uh let me just there's no wrong way or right way to stand up or sit down everyone but there are ways that reflect increased function especially when you're in a dysfunctional state that right yeah right I don't want to we're not trying to um yet tell people what to do or not to do but it was like wow you know I'm probably hunched over too much I think my hips are back too far when I'm sitting um and maybe I'll move to a standing desk or a sit stand desk which is what I did lo and behold prostate pain goes away yeah you know and had I not found that course I might have gone down the path of medication or something else took care of everything I also I will say the other thing I learned was I I tend to have a slight um anterior pelvic tilt so thinking about the pelvis like a bowl as I understand like if that bowl could be um you know the ridge of that bowl could be parallel to the ground or Tilted forward anterior pelvic tilt or back you know posterior pelvic tilt neutral seems like a good idea but most people tend to have a you know some natural propensity towards one or the other started wearing I pretty much always wore flat shoes Adidas or you know skateboard shoes are pretty flat I lucked out there the shoe game is strong today the shoe game is strong today adidos still wear them every day I love them um or or no shoes yeah you know which is which is great and I noticed okay that corrected some of um some of that prostate pain too um by making oh excuse me what what helped correct it was to make sure that in the gym I did something it turned out to be glute ham raises that would put my P take my pelvis through a a fairly full range of motion from from you know posterior to anterior tilt and I've come to love the glute ham raay we're talking full range glute ham raises as one of the most useful tools just posturally for pelvic floor so not it's stiffness in the system resetting it high neurologic component to actually do the thing one of the things I hinted at earlier is like I've chased biometer output right int abdominal pressure and being able to have a pelvic floor that works for you is part of that system like again we can take the physiology and Goose it up and down what's interesting about I had a a famous friend who was filming a TV show and we're working on his internal rotation of his hip so if you're you imagine someone on your back and I bring your knee to your chest and I swing your foot away from your midline right the femur rolls in that's inter rotation of the femur for everyone and I worked on his intern rotation of his femur and just improved his hip flexion knee to chest just got those things going I get this text that night he's like bro what is up with my boners they're out of control what is going on out of in the in the positive direction and I was like well there's this thing called blood flow and when we improve blood flow turns out re profusion is on the list of things that we Chase so he'd been uh crimping the hose so to speak just stiff right and and I think when we start to see that endopelvic fascia as a system it's so easy for us to be reductionists like I wouldn't even say you had prostate pain I would say you had pain in your prostate area right and in fact that's what was told that prostate region right and and P you're like I don't know where my prostate is okay that's General sense and I I also saw that PSA level was well within normal actually low range and I was like what in the world is going on here and you start you know you can find some pretty scary stuff online about about spinal cord injuries and this kind of thing did what we just talked about um and boom it's never been an issue again we have um all the Olympic lifting gyms even our gym we kept a towel on the platforms so that women particularly would pee themselves when they would receive a heavy clean heavy snatch and we would just wipe it up they'd actually urinate on the platform oh yeah that happens all the time all over the Olympics everywhere you'll see that that is blading continents is not normal right totally normal to poop yourself before a fight that's what animals do totally not normal to pee yourself peeing yourself is a sign of disregulation for sure so what we're as you're seeing is though hey I can't manage this high intraabdominal pressure creating and what ends up happening is we pee ourselves so we can start by saying well are there positions and shapes theoretically I want your public floor to work in all the shapes it's Maxim there'll be some shapes where it just doesn't work as effectively and if you're a man so we're getting into it if you go P you'll see a lot of men will put their hand on the wall and they'll adopt a anterior pelvic tilt to to pee and what they'll do is basically just turn the pelvic floor off and so if you stand up and do a big anti your pelvic tilt your pelvic floor will lose some of its tone and it's easier to initiate a string so anterior pelvic tilt again folks is imagine your pelvis is a bowl you're tilting It Forward like you're going to pour water out of the bowl which is a fair analogy here that's right you're saying ideally they keep a a neutral pelvis and use the force of their of their muscles control their no no I'm saying that if you it's much more difficult to pee in this position where we have high in like high control over these systems and what you'll see is that most people will adopt a shape where they basically inhibit their public Flor so they can pee standing up I can't believe we're going to dissect urine posture urinating urinating posture but I think it's I think it's really important let's contrast that to the famous sculpture of the the boy ping and he's and I like leaning backed leaning back same same posture he's his pelvis is forward and he's leaning back that's the same posture so son will know this right um so um you know when you're a young kid young boy um you can like it almost feels like you can pee over a car if you had to maybe I tried that I'm just saying it was a Volkswagen one right so but here's so is there a proper posture for peeing no no no but initiating a stream maintaining a stream is like that's a sign of sexual health of Functional Health this you're General Health and what's nice now is notice how we got to this very nuanced conversation about a Cal dysfunction about bladder insufficiency about right peeing ourselves we got there through performance by we'll have athletes who literally had a whole bunch of babies suddenly have difficult time creating High inch abdominal tone will jump rope and as soon as and pee and as soon as they come back to a more organized position that allows them to transfer energy more effectively recruit better musculature have better organization ping stops so what we said female athl our women athletes you recommend they jump rope well yeah absolutely eventually I need to challenge that floor that's an easy way to do it but what we see is can you squeeze your butt and jump at the same time and what you'll find is that a lot of people as soon as they adopt this interior pelvic tilt glute goes off and they don't have that glute control so that can be problematic for a whole host of features so imagine I was hoping we're going to get to hip extension eventually but you know what we see is that stiffness in the front of the quads and interior line of fascia stiff front of capsule whatever the mechanism is we do a lot of sitting we're just we're squatters my inability to take my knee behind my hip we call this knees behind butt knees behind butt guy that's what I want to be known as knee but goes behind your butt like you're to lunch that's right sorry Ben um and then what we're you're going to see is a lot of times when we put people in those positions they can't get a good glute squeeze okay could one practice this I'm thinking about it's been a while since I've taken a yoga class and squeeze your butt you would be like yeah I can practice this okay so there's a pose in in yoga and I'm not not an advanced Yogi but I've taken a few yoga classes in my day where you you're on your you're basically um cropped up sitting on your knees soort of like in the C and then yeah High kneeling and then um hard to squeeze your butt there isn't it it's hard to squeeze your butt there and then because of all the forces yanking you interiorly those fascial lines the the quads you're basically in that high kneeling position and because the lower leg is bent behind you you're being dragged forward and it's difficult to squeeze your butt and extend over backwards so there's that do they call it camel pose where you reach back and grab your heels and you're supposed to look up at the ceiling that's a gnarly one it's a gnarly one if you do it in the Bay Area the t-shir will say don't be surprised if some emotions come up no if you do this in Austin Texas they just say it's supposed to hurt keep going I'm just joking here this is like Regional humor but in any event um I think that's actually accurate by the way um but in any event it's it is slightly um unusual for most people who aren't accustomed to it to do that pose again doing that pose bring it up for a reason and if you don't do that pose you might do Kipping pull-ups that's a global extension position all we're doing is taking the spine and putting a huge Global load in it instead of a localized load so an anterior pelvic tilt we might think of localized extension in flexion where I have one or two segments doing the line share we whenever we can prefer to have Global flexion extension because the spine maintains its Integrity a little more effectively so doing things like wheel pose awesome putting your hands up near your ears pushing your feet flat on the ground pushing up into a you know an arc Arc shape on the ground great Diagnostics this should be is this something that most people should be able to do yes can most people probably do it no can we then break down the components of it yeah absolutely even iyangar Yogi Master started to bring in props block and belts because he was seeing that his his students weren't able to achieve some of the base shapes and what they were doing was human Jenga to get into those patterns they were just solving the problem and he was like hold up let's not go around the problem let's support you while we load you and breathe in these these positions and shapes given that most people don't have a ton of time for movement um designated blocks of time for movement um if one were going to do let's say some uh attempt toward wheel pose practice or camel pose practice or um any number of the other things that we're talking about here which are taking the body into positions that it that we're not naturally putting it into given our activities otherwise na um would you suggest doing these at the end of a resistance training workout when does it work for you at some point you need to be exposed in this position when are you going to get exposed to this position if it happens to be able to be clumped in with your training fantastic if it's at home in the evening fantastic if you if you've done Sun salutation before it's old school right it's almost like they were like let's get this system going a little bit so later on the day it's a little bit easier so at some point we need to expose you to some positions we have something called The Hip spin up and typically for my athletic populations my teams especially I'm like hey I want you to do one of three things in the morning got 10 minutes that's all I'm asking 8 to 10 minutes hip spin up shoulder spin up or breath spin up just just do one of those if if your back hurts or knee hurts you get hip spin up if your shoulder or neck hurts you get shoulder spin up and then if not just cycle through those so at least in the morning we're starting to touch some of these crucial shapes that you're never in and if you do the hip spin up and suffer I'm like well that's telling me about your movement history your injury history your movement diet and again nothing that we do on the ready state is related to super natural levels of range of motion just basic range of motion the range of motion again that everyone met learns in med school everyone learns in physical therapy school so what's fun about what you said around this sort of this pelvic floor Health piece is that when we get people doing some mobilization really brought to me really brought my attention of Jill Miller is that we start mobilizing the endopelvic fascia we just land a ball just anywhere from your pubic bone to your D your up to Dio process but particularly belly button South you'll see that none of that should be uncomfortable and one of the reasons we see high incidents of you know pelvic floor dysfunction but also High incidence of sports hernas is that we have a hip that doesn't work very well and ends up dragging that pelvis into positions where it's not muscularly very strong right I can get out of position where I have a lot of good sort of activation or or access to those positions then I have fascia and musculature that's super stiff because every time you do abs you celebrate the stiffness right you do abs you're like oh I'm sore today I'm going to go have some ice cream when's the last time you manage your hamstrings or quads probably yesterday when's the last time you rolled out your abs and your obliques never previous life right previous life before you respond so I think one of the things that we're seeing is again that would be a perfect time to do in the evening don't go to the gym and lay on the kettle bell and be a creepy guy instead pull out that volleyball at home pull that princess ball you got at Walgreens and start having a conversation with your pelvic floor turns out you know your your abdomen the pelvic floor can also be mobilized so we just it's really simple front of your pelvis is your pubic bone that's the front of the pelvic floor the back is your coxic and each is yield to baras your sit bones as the side everything else is your pelvic floor so you can take a ball and just stay away from the holes and if anything hurts to compression you found a problem so you can contract and relax apply that same tissue so I might be on my side I might be rolling with the ball right underneath me you you would just be sitting down on your coffee table and just putting that sitting that ball in and around your pelvis and around your glutes and around your pelvic floor right you might be dangerously close to your grundle you're welcome so the the idea here though is you know often times when we'll have athletes with back pain we're not looking at their pelvic floor or hip pain but you have six short hip rotators right you don't just have a couple rotators you have a huge Rotator cuup of the hip and some of those things are congruent and and kind of part of that pelvic floor so it's that I need to go after my P FL every day because again not let me just add another thing to do your list but if something changes I suddenly wake up and I don't have an erection I suddenly are discovering that I'm peeing myself because I'm an elite cyclist right and something's happening that I'm like oh I don't know what to do here let me start to work on my belly let me see if I can work on restoring my positions and can I do a little pelvic phone immobilization and that's a great place to start and which doctor was involved none Which pelv floor therapist was involved none in fact if you carry that to your your your specialist they're going to be like all right right we get to have the real conversation now because you've already done the other stuff one thing that um frightens me and maybe unnecessarily so is when I see um men in particular doing crunch work like ab work crunching with ankles crossed um a because um people tend to cross the same ankle over the other one they don't they don't symmetrically switch uh uh sides that's good and my um my other understanding is that this can also lead to some pelvic floor issues and asymmetries simple solution could be to not cross the ankles while doing um like repeated contraction work of of the abdominals it might being silly I would put that lower on the list of problems I have right like I think if we went into the world right now and looked at people doing curls you know curl-ups the real thing is is that your only way that you're the abdominals you know am I do I have a bigger range of motion of the trunk there are so many ways to be thinking about what the trunk should be doing and reducing it down to this one curl I think if one of the things that we're looking at like I'd much rather you hang from a bar and curl up yep so this is the this is pretty much I W to say the only ab work I do I do some anti-rotation work by staggering my stance when I do curls or anything else cuz it's a very time efficient way to do it making sure my belly button staying St so you're resisting the temptation to rock from side to side and get the anti- rotation work obviously switching up The Stance but doing what you described hanging from a bar doing Pikes um to me you're also getting grip work just for time efficiency also not just separating the ABS and working with the abdominals with the knee to the chest because that's really what we're seeing is that do you only need your abs working in this position so basically you're reproducing another seated position except you're crunching your chest to your seated knee and that's really what that position is do we do it long what happens if you do it long lever short lever means elbow is bent long lever is the elbow is straight short lever is the knee is bent long lever is the leg is straight so why aren't we working in all those patterns and positions and then being creative there are so many G resources the the kids at um Dave Durante has an free ab workout he's an Olympic gymnist from Stanford Superstar but you can go on to I think it's I said Iron Monkey sorry guys and uh you know what you'll see is um there's so much fun ways to play and think about what the role of the trunk should do and I think we're moving beyond thank goodness this like I have to be a rigid robot all the time and that we need to ask what is the trunk supposed to do a good way of thinking about this and I think you're sit up is a good analogy um really a book that makes the rounds from time to time is a book called the spinal engine by Serge grovy and he really talks about the trunk as a driver of power not just as a chassis of which the big engine moves and that really is a nice conceptual way of simplifying movement but if we Define functional movement most people agree it works in a wave of contraction from trunk to periphery from core to sleeve from axillary skeleton to peripheral skeleton but that means boy there are positions where I'm really effective and can generate a lot of force and there'll be position positions where I can but if my spine can't handle flexion it's not a spine if it can't extension it's not a spine if it can't rotate and be into these complex position shapes I'm like red flag so how are you training that thing and if your only rigid Dogma is straight up and down which is a great reason to do Mobility work is suddenly we can side Bend and we can twist and am I exposing myself to some of those shapes and so we call that work borrowing from one of my Olympic uh friends Stu McMillan spinal engine work putting PVC side bending playing with the different shapes and again if you threw get into the David W ropes if you threw medicine balls you would suddenly see you're like you're right I can't be a rigid piece how am I training the functionality of my trunk Beyond just my six-pack because at you know straight curling will certainly give you six-pack but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to surf with power run with power punch with power Etc I mean look at what just happened with those fights right with the women you know fighting just the rotational power that they have you can't get that from just cross crunches with your legs so the fight right before the um Tyson Jake Paul fight was arguably the best fight and people had seen it a long long time the spirit of it and just the I mean they were just incredible everyone watches women's sports it was really great so I think what's great now is if we can get people to start to be curious and to play and you know I'm not saying you need 10,000 different movements but instead of just hanging from the bar and doing knees to elbows or toes to Bar what happened if you brought your right foot to your left hand and you started adding in a rotation to that and suddenly you're like I suck at this and ultimately what I want to do is I want to uncover every deficiency in this play because I'm still going to deadlift I'm still going to swing I'm still going to launch I'm do all the things that I know that makes me feel robust and makes me ride my bike better and be a better kayaker but simultaneously there's a lot of play on either side of that I love that you're defining progression as is incorporating these um novel movements exploring dude that's Westside 101 Lou Simmons I mean like hey this week we're squatting with this bar then we're squatting with this bar and then we're changing your height then we're changing your stance I mean Westside barbell has been doing this for ever I didn't realize they did that I knew they were like crazy gnarly like every bar has its own Max right and so what they've done has said hey the squat pattern is the thing we're training but how do we put another twist to the pretzel now the weights in front now the weight's behind now it's out and now it's too deep and now we're box squatting now and like wow you're going to have to be a really confident skilled squatter to handle all that seems like in so many sports not just for resistance training but in so many sports um there's this move uh shift now toward being an ATV an all Trin vehicle like you can't afford to just be good at one thing you know um and the cool thing about it is that you know the more dynamic range that people are expressing the more kind of evolution you see of any kind of sport and I think we're going to see see this with Fitness too I'm realizing this as we have this conversation that what you're really suggesting is that people explore their movement patterns I love this thing that I've heard you say for years and I know McKenzie harps on this too which is Brian Mackenzie that is um you should be able to breathe well in every position it's such a fun test actually it's such an easy test you know squat down like you're going to get something out of the cupboard see if you can take like a full belly breath see if you can get that your belly going out on the inhale there I like to do this test myself every once while hang from the bar I'll you know those Pikes I don't get very many of them admittedly I'm doing like five sets of five occasionally we'll try and twist a little bit and as my grip strength improves slightly maybe I'll be able to get more usually my grip strength smaller legs it would be easier um I'll take that as either a compliment or an insult coming from you Kelly um Kelly's exceedingly strong he deadlifts 600 lbs on the regular he's he's exceedingly strong and he's he has incredible endurance you're actually more of an endurance guy I think this is worth mentioning that you have why I'm not very strong you have you have more of um right but um have you seen my strong friends I'm not I'm not deflecting your physiology is definitely biased towards certain things like unequivocally and what I am not good at is being brutally strong oh I've been training for 20 plus years hard training longer than that 30 years and this is all I can deadlift that's pathetic have you seen my strong friends so what you see is that I've been cramming a square peg into a round hole because I really like it but really I should be probably 190 lb and I should be an aerobic athlete right like if we threw a 100 lb backpack on you and went backpacking you'd be fine you you'd be like a even now in the you you're sitting at somewhere like 240 right you're like 62 you you can go you can go for days like you're naturally an endurance athlete and I think it's worth saying because people are listening Kell a big guy all my training is biased towards you cannot believe how much conditioning I do I am a disciple of Joel Jameson I'm a huge fan of to look at where I'm spending my time in these different heart rate zones and then you know I'm just such a nerd of that because my primary sport is trying to keep up with my wife on the mountain bike I I think this is really important because I think we've been talking a lot about things kind of adjacent to resistance training I think it's a wonderful shift now in in culture that resistance training is being uh used done by by by Young People by older people women and men you know it's fantastic this was not the case 10 years ago this was definitely not the case 20 years ago was like bodybuilders football preseason football players and Military were the only people weight training now it's everywhere um but you're naturally an endurance athlete um I'm guessing that most people I'm assuming is this true fall into the slower twitch kind of more endurance propensity then um I mean how many truly naturally strong fast fiber type people are walking walking around out there if we just took the general that are are sprinters and super springy and you you know who those people are they're mutants you know um I think I was always best at a skilled sport that use conditioning or use strength when I compare myself to my friends who have huge arobic engines it's embarrassing I'm always the weakest fattest slowest smallest person in the room and it is I can't like if you just want to Ego check just come out hang out with me just meet my friends see the people we're working with and you'll see you're like okay genetics is not the same I think we've told a little bit of a lie in the internet sphere that like if you eat this way and you do these you'll be elite and like we can certainly say that you have a training effect for sure and you should do that but that's not the same thing as being a mutant and there are just so mean mutants out there shocking yeah I think I think um it's actually a worthwhile exercise to figure out what one's natural leanings are what do you like to do how about that I just think it's important that we remind ourselves that the whole point of this is to have the most fun and what you'll see he put up a video of some Chinese elementary school kids and the Chinese Olympic lifting team coaches coming and assessing their kids and very quickly they put kids over at squats they had them jump on a single leg they had them do double jumps and they were like you you you have your parents call me right so you can already see that coordination matters wiring matters exp and they were able to say hey these are the things that we think are going to make good Olympic lifters so those kids I think we start to split cohort early on but most important is everyone needs to weightlift period and it's not light to Pink dumbbells it's real heavy weightlifting but how much do you need to do to be better at your sport or to minimize your spine those are the spine changes or or osteopenia or osis those are great conversations but not necessarily conversations about performance right so it's almost like we need to divide this into like Aesthetics and I'm keeping myself intact in versus I want to go to the Olympics because what you're seeing on the world right now is that it everyone's an expert I'm like can I see how you work with 40 athletes can I see how you periodize that can I see how you manage travel and nutrition can I see how you know you were responsible or not responsible for this team having all its members so what we're seeing is that it's a this performance thing is a really big task and it gets confused and water down a little bit by everyone fitnesses well I I squat so I'm an expert too not the same our good friend Kenny Kane taught me something he's sh ke shaking his head the best the best he's a wonderful guy you're not going to find him on social media because a few years ago he just decided to take his gym and and himself off social media he's a very very talented so we're going to give you his phone number we're going to have you call him because he can't DM him very talented uh athlete and wonderful person he taught me something uh say about eight years ago that I've found oh so useful for uh my training longevity my enjoyment of training and it was this very simple 80% of your workouts Andrew he said are going to be at 80% of what you could do that day okay that involves some humility I like to sweat hard I associate intensity with hard work etc he said 10% are going to be at 90% intensity meaning 100% is the most you could give possibly in whatever time is allotted on that day given the Sleep given the nutrition given the life circumstances on that day the Readiness for that day right and then here's where it breaks down a little bit more 5% are going to be at 95% and 5% across the year are going to be maximum 100% everything you can give Do or Die workouts that day and for me last year I believe it was was that was the The Rock carry C cam hand's podcast I gave everything I had had of course had the mountain been a little bit higher I'd like to think I would have gone a little bit further but I gave everything I could because that rock was slippery and it was muddy and my hamstring was out the day when we started that you know I was in pain when we started anyway I think that advice that Kenny gave me was some of the best advice I've ever heard because my tendency would have been and had been to come in and go at 90 95 or 100% every single workout CA PRK Long Way Y and it also brought me to this place where after8 or 10 weeks of training I would get a cold or I'd get some nagging thing a little thing not you know wouldn't put me under but then or I need to take a week off normal accident Theory right so I think um I'd love your thoughts on on Kenny's recommendation for me it's one of the things that I pass along anytime says how about some Fitness advice I say well listen I'm a neuroscientist not a fitness guy but I know a thing or two based on the mistakes I've made here's a great piece of advice that's really helped me 80% of your workouts 80% intensity another 10% at 90% then the 95 you know 5% at 95 and 5% across the year are the all out everything you can give leave it all on the mat type workouts we could start with a simple idea we we say let's be consistent before we're heroic right I if your intensity causes you to not be able to show up for the gym for three days I'm like sweet that was sweet and our ration response to that is sucky right I much rather you be getting more consistent and not blowing yourself out remember that there was a phase where we like you shouldn't be sore when you leave the gym remember that like there people would talk about hey leave some reps in the reserve like show up the next day Grease the groove that's old P Seline stuff I think that's really good advice especially since most people are not 20 most people and when you're 20 you need to go find out what the limits are touch the fence the electric fence once in a while right lick the lick all the doorknobs let's just call it that way but uh you you know what ends up happening is there's a lot of things have to be in place for you to be able to go to the well that many times and what we know now because we have all of this data is that we can make better progress not burning It To The Ground every single time and it's difficult for us because if I'm Just Fitness how do I quantify that right it's easy for us to quantify another kilo or another Watt that's makes it a lot easier and what you'll see is the best practices of these athletes we do spend a lot of 70 to 80% heart rate that's what we call recovery in Joel Jameson language 80 to 90 we're calling that conditioning 90 and above overload but what I think is nice is that that gives me a lot of there are some days where I touch 78 or 80% and it's hard because I'm sleep deprived stressed out my nutrition hasn't been great I'm sleeping in a strange bed right you know traveling whatever so I think what you're seeing is um is something that one of my uh early coaches talked about Mike bergner he says when the frying Pan's hot let's cook and that means I need to know myself and as a coach I need to know you and I'm like Andrew you look great today how do you feel great let's go let's go chase something right and when the frying Pan's hot we cook but the frying pan is not always hot and if you pour in bang energy and Jack 3D and you can't even hear inputs and outputs so I I think you I think that's such solid reasonable advice and really what we're looking at is how can we get you to train much more consistently longer and longer and longer you can only go to the well a few times and what I'll tell you is that is I still love to power clean it's like my favorite thing and that 100 kilo power clean is heavier than it was when I was 40 you know and I want to pretend like that 100 kilo power clean is not a problem but I actually have to progress and get myself there and there are days where I'm like n 80 80 kilos is my jam today so I think that's really good advice and difficult for us to say how are we measuring success in our training subjective experience well no problem let me give you a baby keep this newborn alive and then let's go see how hard your training is the next day you're going to be terrible you haven't slept all night you're stressed right so I think what's nice is having some sub objective measurements around maybe body composition is one of them if that's important to you but are you getting faster over the course of a week what are your testing how do we know inputs and outputs and now we're just doing we're baking a lot we're making a lot of uh suicides right you the old fountain drink where you just makes all the things it's you know they always taste the same at the end like crap but that suicide where you mix all the fountain drinks is a little bit of what we're seeing in that and one way of protecting ourselves is saying hey let's make sure you can train tomorrow suicides I was reflecting on that the other day for some reason why at a wedding or a party young typically it's a y chromosome Associated disorder to feel like you have to mix a bunch of bunch of stuff in then get someone to drink it um non-alcoholic drinks for young kids by the way mixing all the sodas putting M&M just something like all my my my male friends and I think that's what we see a little bit and if you you if you I am a deep coach nerd I love Fitness I love Fitness thing I'll jump into any class anytime like sure let's go let's see you know I it's so fun but I need to see I I do get to watch sort of Trends come and go things get very hot you know they get very popular they and again the fitness has become a hobby it's an amuse and that's okay it's totally okay that JY is a hobby but that doesn't hint about what's the best way to develop capacity Elite capacity long-term longevity capacity it those things almost don't go together let's talk about hip extension oh bless you um as somebody who um doesn't like the elliptical or stationary bike but loves the assault bike I love the assault bike I don't know why um just feels like really good work it is hard work uh but you're not going to find me on Bill made it harder with the Echo Bike thanks for making it worse what the Echo Bike the Rogue Echo Bike is even worse than the assault bike uh the assault Bike by the way folks is the one with the fan and um I'm not sure if they put the fan is for resistance not to not to keep you cool but it has that effect somewhat in the winter you'll know what the fan does U so um the Echo Bike is a harder assault bike it's just like imagine do doing it on fire uphill in the sand with a headwind then you're like okay this is if you can make it worse it's worse if you have one of these I'm going to swing by this winter break and uh and try this thing but I love that because High physiology low skill that's great you just described me in a nutshell I can take anyone not know have to know anything about your range of motion and I can be like who are you physiologically today let me introduce this freakish amount of work in this tiny range of motion that's very safe so we can really touch High intensities very safely there mhm yeah I like it much more than the skier I'll do the skier every once in a while but I I find that the skier if I just sit sit and stand a bunch of times I be like I can just do this for for 15 days you know like is this exercise and I'm like am I doing this right I don't know for some reason doesn't feel like work the assault bike always feels like work always feels like work okay so hip extension the assault bike is not hip extension typically you're you know tend to be people tend to be hunch forward you could get upright right you can still don't have any hip extension so no hip extension let's talk about if I'm squatting and I stand up I'm extending the hip as you stand up right I'm going from flexion to extension yeah one thing that I think for people listening that um at least is helpful for me when when hearing about squatting is to think about um whether or not it's a deadlift or a squat you can imagine taking your hands putting your fingers at your hips and you you know hiding your hands in your in your um in that joint between the femur and your pelvis as you go down right your hands get get tucked into the the fold between between the two and as you stand up it opens so it's hip hinge they typically call it right and I think what you we look at the squat and the lunge is very their cousins and the difference is long lever short lever and typically how you're holding the weight that's the only difference and sometimes UPR torso position but ultimately we're really looking at you know what's happening with the degree of Bend of the of the knee right that's why they're such elegant cousins but if I'm squatting down and I stand up people are like I'm working on extension work on extension all the time I'm like okay now let's continue this extension conversation and bring that knee behind your butt into a lunge and that's hip extension and if there's one thing that I'm seeing across so many of the populations I work with is we're starting to see changes and erosion in this fundamental expression of power the only people we don't see it is our Olympic sprinters they're and and you'll see that Pockets like we work with the All Blacks and we're obsessed on maintaining the hip EXT mention these very strong athletes because it means that they can run faster on the field rugby team those um am I correct in thinking that hip extension we can think of as a um you partially reflecting hamstring function where the hamstring is responsible for bringing the heel up toward the butt but also for bringing the femur back behind the Torso I I realize I'm not using the PT Language by the way the PT is online your community of the pts you guys just crack me up in the field of of uh medicine there's there's an analogous sub specialty of medicine where they have the similar kind of like orneriness and it's being a PT is very competitive and so there's a you don't do this but the PT Community it's like it's some you can make a cart you can make a whole sitcom about this the the attacks often range from significant to like cluster around Petty not because they're not knowledgeable but because there's so much Nuance in this field right and it seems that there are few things that everyone agrees on and then everything else people love to argue in community out of community so anytime I say anything about movement of the body I wanted to just say I realize I'm probably not using the correct I'm going to use that same defense of petty cluster clustering the pettiness I'm sorry all the physical therapists out there I haven't represented you in the way that you would like to be represented I'll say I'm just talking about my own experience differences in nomenclature right and I am trying to be very meticulous in my language today yeah um one of the things that we want to look at is um and this is a Philip Beach muscles Meridian idea is that there are contractual fields and this goes along with if we look at Thomas Meyer's Anatomy trains of seeing the system as a system of system so we start to look at your back and your Erectors and then we tie that into the glutes and then we tie that into the hamstrings and tie the calf it's kind of a almost wraps around the door the bottom of the foot right the planet surface of the foot so suddenly we're we're looking looking at this global system that's designed to create this Mass extension position Locomotion we start to lock some of those pieces down a little bit but one of the things that we've seen is that when you aren't competent in this position your hamstrings for example have to do a lot more work because your butt is no longer working on hip extension your adductors are restricted and they're not bringing you back into flexion so suddenly what we see is that your hamstrings are having to do the work of calf but one your hamstrings are tied all the time you don't have hip extension so a simple test we do is called the couch stretch and all you need to do is face a wall then turn away from the wall so you're kneeling on the ground hands and knees away from the wall you're going to put one of your knees in the corner so your foot is going straight up and down the knee is in the corner of the wall and then I want you to see if you can squeeze your butt in that position still hot hands and KNE except one foot now is kind of in the corner down the wall going toward butt that's position one a lot of people are going to struggle with recruiting and activating their butt in that position because it's what I'm calling positionally inhibited we don't know what the mechanism is so you're getting the knee back behind the Torso much as one would if they if you were sprinting and the rear leg is is really we're just flexing the lower leg we're flexing the lower leg shank right that lower limb second position is to come up into a high kneeling position position so you just bring your knee up and like you're kneeling except that we have a trailing leg now with a leg that's going up the wall so front leg is sort of a right angle right you have foot on the ground right angle that's right rear leg is a knee tucked in the corner at the where the floor meets the the couch um foot is up on the couch nope just on the ground okay and we'll provide a link to it I called the couch dress cuz I created this thing a long time ago and I created it on the couch for my young athlet while they were watching TV right I just needed some hip extension exposure but we can do it on the wall do on the couch ultimately what we try to say is do you have glute squeeze can you take a breath right if your breath starts to get real small in this position I'm like huh so every time your knee comes behind your body you can't breathe anymore H how's that working for you when you run is that good or bad seems to me that your breath should remain pretty constant independent of what your hip does so then we like to see if people can come to a more upright position so that's kind of position three so a little bit more upright torso we're starting to increase hip demands as the Torso comes upright torso is coming upright the knee is moving further away from the chest on that loaded leg and what you'll see is that most people are going to be like wow that's real stiff or I can't even get there or I can't breathe there or I have to Banana back to get there and I certainly can't squeeze my butt there and I want to tell everyone this is a low-level test the real test is your front foot goes up on a 12in to 18inch box so we're not even in the test yet we're with front leg front no front leg just up higher so we Elevate the front leg into what's called a hip lock so that front leg is suddenly taking my pelvis and rotating it posteriorly knee is bringing the running into pelvis pelvis is like tucking and now you're really going to see what's going on with your hip extension so this is the equivalent position more or less of front knee um sprinting like really like like jut it up in the air you know maybe even past the belly button definitely past the belly butt rear rear leg behind you so this is sort of like you know coton mid stride okay that's right and so suddenly we have this nice test that allows us to see in our competency there and I want to remind you if you do the couch stretch and filament your knee is actually in hip extension it's not your knee isn't even behind your butt here it's that hard and I'm still biasing it towards flexion so what we're seeing is that you have a real deficit of hip extension so that's one way to improve it you could just do the test camp out there take some breaths contract relax breathe do your resistant isometrics whatever you want to do there so many ways to J that up rotate side bend the question is how are you now loading that thing in your life so we can put a band on you and get you do some isometric standing but show me in your movement language in the gym how you're reinforcing hip extension so when we were talking about deadlifting with a tandem stance still not hip extension right I'm extending the hip but that trail leg is not rear foot elevated split squat ding ding ding ding we start to get there right bulgarians flipping a tire like any time where I need to be able to a big lunge is a good example forward lunge back lunge tell me about flipping a tire so are you talking about flipping a tire but then at the top of the movement you're doing like a kettle bell swing Where You Buck your hips forward like you're going to try and pee over that Volkswagen pushing over don't try and pee at the top but but you're talking about bucking the hips forward that's right suddenly you're upright and that leg that trailing leg is in extension in a long lever position so we spend a lot of programming one of the best persons at this is France Bosch um I mentioned earlier and he has something I've termed like the Bosch snatch so if you imagine being in a double stance so I'm just like I'm swinging a kettlebell if I took a plate or a dumbbell doesn't matter I'm just going to basically go from a hip hinge and as I go overhead with the weight of the load whatever is appropriate for you I'm going to take my front foot and step it up on a box so all of a sudden I'm going from a flexed position in the hip c-shaped body right or or upright torso but hinged c-shaped right weird C and then havela C and then I'm going to step forward and now I'm going to have that one of those legs is going to be an extension and so suddenly now we're adding speed to this extension because that's not what we do with reverse rear foot elevated split squats we're not loading that in speed so we start at the speed component to what we're doing and suddenly we've discovered another way to challenge our movement it doesn't just always be half heavier it can also be faster so I'm basically if imagine if I was here's a great example I love pressing I think overhead pressing is the bees knees it's one of my non-negotiables we're going to press seesaw press overhead press we're pressing but if I take your front foot and put it up on a box make sure that back foot is straight with all your toes on the ground and press from that position you're going to find out why you don't have any hip extension it's going to be so you won't even think about the weight you'll think about your growing exploding so a lot of you recommend people probe that that mean those mechanics AB with very light dumbbells at first no go press go find out how way you can press overhead and you're going to see that like wow this tandm stance front foot elevated you know press is going to kill you can um there there's a movement I do I'm guessing well I'm curious if it activates hip extension the way I think it does here's here's what I've been doing that I found useful I don't know if it's true or not but what I'll is I'll tie a fairly thick band to a pull-up bar I I'll squat down I'll hold it like I'm holding a like a pole in front of me like a pole carrier in a in a um in a parade or something I'll squat down and I'll jump up and but instead of of um but I'll Buck my hips forward at the top so like feet go out in front it's very unnatural U movement actually as opposed to jumping and putting my toes down pointing my toes down my toes are are kicking forward so I'm trying to mimic the top of a kettle bell swing at thep top of this movement I I would say you know one of the things that is useful for me as I am asked to come and tear through people's programming look for holes in their movement practices we look at fundamental shapes so what's nice is that okay hang on everyone let me let me Define exercise for you let me just I'll just give you a little framework and I'll start by saying something inflammatory the shoulder is not that complicated it doesn't do that many things goes overhead MH goes out to the side goes in the front it goes in the back that's what your shoulder does you can bend the elbow you can twist and all those shapes but those are the four fundamental primary organizations of the shape of the of the shoulder hip has flection extension right really I could I can go laterally but that's just a different kind of squat but really like am I squatting with the foot really narrow or my squat a little bit wider so what we can then do is say in these fundamental bookends these benchmarks this what we call archetype suddenly I can ask well how are you loading your overhead position so if you're always pressing on a bar or pulling on a lat down machine you actually are overhead but you're not in the fullest expression over overhead right which is your arms straight up and down parallel by your ears hands over the top of your head STS over your head right so what we can then do is say well what what tools do you like to use Kettle Bell's great that's one of the reasons k was so great single arm I can't hold it out here it's going to fall I have to finish over my head right dumbbells the same but the kettle bell is ass salt it constrains us to express full overhead motion I can look at do you have enough inter rotation with the Hand by the side are you doing enough pressing like activities chaturanga the finished position of my row right bench press dip running those are all movements where my shoulder comes into extension whether the arm is straight or bent so what's nice now is I can say well am I distracting those tissues or compressing those tissues well you're like well what do you mean I'm like are you pressing or are you doing a pull-up right pressing overhead or doing a pull-up that's compressing or distraction right very simple ways of looking at these movements we can say well how are you coming there did you get there from a snatch or did you get there from a front rack position so we can look at start position finish position and suddenly what you're realizing is you're like oh I'm starting to understand the root movements and root positions that help me improve performance predict future performance and help me get through pain because if I have people not expressing the highest levels expression of the movement that's something we can improve that's technique right it's not just get bigger and stronger it's hey let's be more technically proficient so I have all of these ways of looking at the movement selection choices again what are you comfortable with but then I can challenge it with load make it heavier we can do volume we could add speed we could add cardiorespiratory demand you could do more than five and suddenly you have to do 20 and we have metabol demand in there you and I are competing all of a sudden right now suddenly I go from open Torque to closed torque I go from giving you a barbell to a dumbbell right I go from open chain to closed chain suddenly we're like holy moly block practice random practice I have all the tools for me to understand are you competent putting your arms over your head or are you exposing these shapes under these different domains and I think when we only look at sort of a few ranges of motion and we only look at load as the way then we lose all the opportunity and richness of programming got it well let me come back to um my silly example of the band and the jump thing and say okay so for getting better hip extension which is what I think a lot of people need is what I'm hearing a lot of people are in hip flexion so you're jumping and then coming up yeah I mean or you know we've seen these beautiful images of certainly not me but like um people doing long jump where they're kind of like in a in a ared position something yeah so the idea is with the band it's safe right you know um trying to get the hip into extension or feed out in front of the jumping it's it's a Kipping pullup without a pull-up you're just Kipping on the bar and I don't Kip on my pull-ups by the way um because I'm a time under no I don't Kip on my pull-ups um I don't I train with Ben Bruno from time to time you keep on a pull-up with Ben Bruno there you're never going to hear the end of it ever so I don't but I don't anyway cuz I I'm a I'm aention that's fine I'm going to say that I love stric pull-ups I do more pull and you can imagine but if you can't Kip there's something wrong with you okay got it uh we'll argue about this more offline um but I love to Sprint so um that's hip extension absolutely uh love to Sprint love to Sprint um and I love jumping like I I'm a big believer in this maybe true maybe not true uh idea that as we get older we tend to jump and land less a lot of injuries come from you know lack of Ecentric Lo saying in out of the Soviet system when you stop jumping you start dying mhm you you and the lowest form could be trampolining the highest low another low form jump roping highest form starting to be really powerful I love it I I you're killing it and what's great now is you just made this switch you start describing your training in blocks of positions what position am I training what shape am I reinforcing right that's a really not it's not a muscle remember your muscles are not wired for movement your brain is wired for movement right you can't you don't have any selective control over a single muscle in your body that's a mistake so you're not really working your biceps you're working arm flexion right in a variety of positions this squat exercise biases my quads more but I'm not actually quading right because that's impossible yeah I think that the um the misconception the broad misconception is that resistance training is just to build and strength and muscles in a bodybuilding kind of fashion and no disrespect to the body body builders but we learned a lot but you know we learned a ton and and and yet most people would probably do well to think about functional movements in fact there are a few Instagram accounts that that really like to come after um not just me but a lot of people that um have talked about resistance training at all that talk about functional patterns and I have to say as much as the the messaging sometimes I think is a little bit abrasive I pay attention to these and I have seen some of the before and afters that they'll show for people that will incorporate into their training like a like throwing or or um you know ballistic movements from you know fully stop sprinting out the gate kind of thing and focusing um immensely on balancing the two sides of the body and without ever having done those programs I have to say like yeah like a lot of these people had some pretty dysfunctional patterns and they look like they're doing better and I think it's because I must I have to assume that they're incorporating a much broader uh range of of movements um more hip extension working the two sides of the body all the things that you're talking about all the things that you're talking about and so I think that the bodybuilding piece I think is a great thing for getting people out the gate I always say the amazing thing about resistance training forgive me for going long here but I think this is something that um if somebody is not naturally inclined to exercise or resistance training resistance training is one of the few forms of exercise that because of the blood flow the so-called pump give people a visual and um sens a sensation based window into the progress they might make hell yeah right I mean this is like like going for a run and getting to like at the end of your run you see a little less body fat and then two days later you you you've reduce your body fat percentage right like it gives you a window into your future when you resistance train that way and and a Gateway into a conversation that's very complex this is all I think about and people are like hey I just want to feel better I don't want to get hurt in my calves when I run you're like okay it can be really simple and also you have your right to look jacked and tan I mean you you can be jacked all you want Mark makes this point every single post look I think um there's something that I try we don't ever punch down we just don't you know just point we point to what we do this just our model but any model that someone's on the internet a model has to do three things it has to explain current phenomenon right it has to predict future phenomenon and it has to be easily communicated so let me see your model how it works how does it explain if I do your thing well I get better at this thing right that's the thing I'm interested in right so when I is oh a lot of recursive fun fitness where people feel better but I still have to go over here and squat or I still have to go over here and and and become conditioned but you can see the truth of needing to expose people to bigger ranges of motion and more skilled movement than some of the things we're getting traditionally in the gym right and and I think one of the things that we saw with like a a pivot towards movement culture right kind of coined by you know portal is that what we were seeing is that the gym didn't beget necessarily better movers what we had was people originally doing a skill throwing something running track and field we would train and then go do more of that and then what we did is we took the gym or took the sport skill movement out of it and we just remained in the gym and you can see the reaction to that as well you're not very elegant you can't don't have any mo Moving Solutions you don't for your energy very well you're not you know you're not graceful you can't you have no rhythm so the real key for us is like I think we want to put playback in there and you can see what the reaction is to hey if we're just doing bench press and hack squats maybe that's not making the best mover but it's certainly making a jacked guy who's what we call what is it in that movie hot girl fit where uh you know it's one of the recent movies where the GU uh who's the guy from uh Twisters that incredible actor he was in Top Gun anyway he's swimming and the girl is like hey why are you out of breath he's like I don't do cardio I just do abs and biceps she's like oh my God your hot girl fit like you have this big engine that looks good with noo and I want to make sure that no offense to all the hot girls out there but the idea here is what is it you want to do with your body let's start there and then we can start to say well what do you have access to what's your training age and it's a Nuance conversation it's probably why you should have a coach and develop a coach for the for the rest of your life but let's not pretend that having abs and big biceps is going to make you a good MMA fighter right and you can see why the resistance of hey that made me less athletic we want to be careful of that yeah I like using the resistance training to make me stronger and better at running yes and that's my that's actually that's what's in my mind I only ran cross country one season in high school wasn't very good but it really enjoyed it but I I love running I've been running for a long time and and I'm I'll never be a I ran cross country one year in high school maybe we ran against each other oh no you're a year older than I am so I I I would yeah well I'll tell the story some other time it's not my my stories aren't are relevant here but but I use resistance training to be able to run better faster further without pain for me that is that is what I would hope we look at training for now apply a longevity lens a durability lens right or as Juliet says she's like don't you want to just be able to pop off the couch and go on adventures right I want to have a body that's capable of that I think what we've been pitching in the gym doesn't really do that and even that I just want everyone to hear and double click on what Andrew said that framework is that I now have a third party objective measure does my running get better with my training it's a really great great way to evalue your training am I faster do I feel better it's really worked for me and it keeps me out of um any uh kind of gravitational pull toward just trying to get more weight on the hack squat machine which I enjoy Progressive overload I enjoy doing movements better with more weight Etc but um I find that the gym just becomes this um when it's a closed loop I find becomes this kind of like endless exploration like what am I really also at this age like I want to maintain strength and build some muscle perhaps but mostly you want to get heavier I don't isn't that weird I don't no my goal right now you need as much muscle as you can because winter is coming my goal is to actually get much stronger without getting bigger and and to keep my endurance going I like to do one long Rucker run per week at one shorter run uh one one Sprint type run I just figure like I'll be everyone what you just described for a typical person is doing a long piece a short piece and a high intensity piece that's red that is really that's the crack yeah that's right every week if I'm you know most weeks and then I'll lift you know legs one day you know torso everyone laughs torso what kind of thing is that you know torso including neck and abs that's next let's go flank too you want to get torso on flank really confused work my flank and uh and then I'll do the what could be called distal muscles I'll do an extra workout for for calvs biceps and triceps and forearms and grip strength on Saturday and and that combination of things right this isn't about my training to me meets the demands of life like I can Sprint for the airplane with my luggage and get there and not cough up both lungs I can go backpacking like if you say hey let's go backpacking or grand Canon tomorrow you're gonna carry 75b sack I'll be a little bit sore at night but it'll feel good I'll feel good sore right um we can um go to the gym together and I can put you know what feels to me like a respectable amount of weight on the hack squat we do some fullrange glute ham raises I can hang from a bar but I'm not trying to beat a pull-up record or run a try run a marathon I find that anytime I've gone to the extreme and any one kind of training I end up injured sick and I'm just not interested in that and I like to think I could be wrong I'm projecting here probably that I'm representative of what most people want I also want to be able to overeat a little bit every now and again like thanksgiving's coming a little bit I also want to be able to not have to eat all day and then eat a big dinner and not dissolve into a puddle of my own tears because I'm neurotically worried about something nutrition-based like I tend to I basically skip one meal a day just by virtue of my schedule right it's like non-intentional intermittent fasting and the people who are obsessive about protein will say well gosh that isn't as good but yeah okay so maybe I get a little bit less muscle I'm not doing I don't want to be so neurotic about my training that I'm not focusing on the bigger missions of my life and notice that what you said was I train so I can have fun and I just want to double click on we have sucked the joy and the play and exposure out of training and out of fitness and now it's I have to have this V2 Max so I'll live to 50 and I have to do right and you forgot that we this whole thing is so you can go spend some credits so I like to say the the gym and all that really focused training is spending time on credits but one of my coach friends Nicole Christenson says CrossFit uh roots she's like we don't nature for time stop naturing for time like this we're surfing so we can surf all day and we can surf more waves than the other kids cuz you're not fit enough right I want to go hike and then ride my bike and play and ski do all the things I want to do with my body and that may me I want to hold my kids or I want to do my job in this you know in this Warehouse we're start to train for life in a little bit more simple way and it doesn't feel like this crazy burden and it also happens to be the best tool to understand how you're moving because my expert coaches can watch you run and be like that's what we're working on and I'll go right to the thing right but for the rest of us we need to say wow my shoulder that bench that fly dumbbell bench was a little bit tricky I'm losing sh shoulder extension right or at least I'm touching these shapes and that ends up being a really interesting diagnostic tool where we can really take a shot at improving function and reducing muscular skeletal distress yeah and I and I think this is the this is the template for it yeah enjoying your training and including enjoying training hard is one of the the best things one can do years ago when I was skateboarding I mean I ruined skateboarding for myself because got picked up out of sympathy to be fair by a couple sponsors and then got obsessed with the fact that you know I wasn't progressing then broke my foot and you know pretty soon I didn't hate it I loved it and I loved the community but it turned into something else and had I just St taken a step back from it and said all right I'm decent at this I could get better and I'm just going to focus on doing it for pleasure and make a living some other way I'd probably be doing you know like you know front side inverts and pools now and then and unfortunately I'm not I'm I'm lucky if I get a nice little front side grind on coping but whereas with Fitness resistance training running I I love resistance training running the cup of coffee before my workout tastes 10 times big as I'm going to work out I I love to use it as an opportunity listen to music listen to podcasts there's so much that's in and around it that's still just pure pleasure even on the days when I'm like at 95% of output or 100% of output or 80% of output I'm like I just I'm having so much fun that's right and I can't wait to get back in there so when we're we are looking at Society Health right the first thing we argue instead of saying what's most important we say what is it you want to do and who are your friends are going to do it with and are you going to do it a lot let's start there then we can start to weasle in everything especially with social isolation with sort of lack of community I mean I feel like sport is the last place where people congregate right Sports Sidelines this is the sort of you know lingua franka of the whole you know world I've taught on every continent except Antarctica everyone knows what a push-up is everyone knows what a deadlift is it's not science sorry it's not math that's not the universal language it is bansch press everyone knows and everyone can tell you how much you bench in any language so there are some things there that are Universal and I think when we look at the human as a moving organism then we can really start to not feel crazy about how our world is changing but how do we fight back by setting up more opportunity to to move more and and for me the the whole lens ends up being like we basically we're trying to parse through complex problems so I have a world champion who's injured um two-time world champion isn't able to finish a tour you know the first question I ask them is tell me about your sleep I'm a rough sleeper oh tell me more about that right because I can't even tell your inputs and outputs unless we're getting into sleep then I say well tell me about your nutrition I eat clean great to find that for me I don't even know what that means clean turns out underc calori under nutrition doesn't get enough macros doesn't get enough micros I'm like oh we start to correct that we start to collect sleep when we really start to divide some of the behaviors into for me as a as a 51y old I'm obsessed with my tissues not failing like tearing Achilles is like every physical therapist worst nightmare and I jump rope every day and I have great range I do so many isometrics I'm just not going to tear my achilles now I'm going to tear my kill but I'm not going to tear my so tissue health is part of that so now I have to look at nutrition I I have to look at my blood work and I have to look at my sleep right so that I can really Define some of those things as that creates a Readiness tissue tolerance Health then I can be looking at the other things and that's really as we start to get again the framework of sport or framework of play creates this place where I can suddenly start to understand inputs and outputs and how to take care of this carcass so that I can do what I want with my body which is our new definition of Mobility can I do what I want with my body and can I be painfree am I correct in my very non-scientific assessment of Instagram accounts whereby when I see a 80 to 100 year old person moving well that person tends to be doing something sort of gymnastics related there's this incredible video of a guy Chinese guy very tall Chinese guy doing essentially skin the cat and then into a pull up skin the cat people can look it up um doesn't involve actual cats hopefully um it should uh 85-year-old uh woman sprinting so we're talking gymnastics type movement sprinting movement um rarely sometimes it'll be somebody in a gym lifting a heavy weight but more often than that it's gymnastic type movement pullup dip parallel bar balance beam sprinting is that what got them there or is that just the expression of what genetics do they feel safe show me nutrition show me their training age but what's noticeable there is that we have disciplines that require greater range of motion and skill of body control and high power output right huh so one of the things that we do in our programming for adults is I make you sprint once a week like Sprint because people have not sprinted and I don't mean you can go out and run I don't think you're capable of that but I'm going to put you on a bike I'm going to put you in control and I'm going to see what your Peak wattage is that sprinting so ideally I would love you to be able to do some heel Sprints and repeats but I don't think you have the tissue tolerance or the range of motion for that and I know what the the outcome is going to be but I can put you on a bike and say can we hit this peak wattage and what you just discovered there was hey I still need to maintain my ability to move quickly and have control through great ranges of motion that is a recipe for you know why if you did yoga and did some Sprints you're going to be pretty badass you know that's a pretty good way and why people who just do the elliptical and the little uh little small dumbbells are they're they're fooling themselves it's a lot of busy work there's a lot of busy work out there it makes people feel like they're involved in a program again the way we want to take our feelings out of it how do you progress those pink dumbbells th000 reps is 2,000 reps right show me progression suddenly I can't progress and regress those things the other thing I want to say is like is it making the thing better what are we training for and you know I I think it it feels decorative to have busy work and I do all this prehab corrective exercise I'm like hold up why don't we do the thing we're doing and regress and progress that and ask if you have native range of motion yes or no but you know if we look at the typical person especially someone listening to this podcast they don't have two hours in the gym so if your program is requiring two hours of me I'm out if it requires an hour of me I might be out you know I'm so busy that sometimes I lots of 30 and 40 minute pieces pepper throughout plus a lot of other play and that's good enough so we really do need to look at how people are finding themselves in their environments to ask is this appropriate for you and what's essential and it turns out a lot of this you know 20-some playing around videoing yourself in the gym is great when you have three or four hours in the gym yeah listening to an entire album or podcast or um book chapters in sequence I think is if I may far more valuable than um allowing oneself the opportunity to text and be on social media during a workout because it just becomes a very distracted thing I think that the workout of any kind is also an opportunity for building concentration and one can listen to podcasts or books Etc but or an album sequentially through but I find at least for myself if if I work out in a way that's interrupted by social media or texting or email because it's available there that it carries through into the rest of the day that I'm more distracted I believe you how about that I believe you and that's what's so great is you're like hey that doesn't work for me you know um I find that my best thinking is done under enormous aerobic load like I literally am like oh and I have an often will jump up and write something on the Whiteboard and then go back and do my thing because you know I'm just it creates Flow State and it's and if I'm distracted I can't really hear what's going on and that's there's a time when I want to distract myself you know and there's a time when I want to be amused that's fine you know I've got to two-hour ride getting ready for a 4-day Backcountry ski trip here in February but notice I've already been getting ready for it for in the beginning of November I am ready it's taking me going to ramp up and so much of my training now is is going towards can I successfully do these four hard days the way I want to so some things come down a little bit strength dials down I change my body composition I'd like to be a little bit lighter I'm playing but there's some times where I have to get two and three hours in of steady work done and I'm like headphones you know what I mean so it's okay to be amused you don't have to be a monk doing what you're doing but I really like what you said feels I feel distracted yeah let's use this is let's use it as a concentration time right let's use it as an interaction time I the gym shouldn't be the lonliest place in the world if you're not making eye contact and talking high-fiving get a different gym I would be remiss if I didn't ask you about fascia you and Jill Miller were some of the first people that I ever heard talk about fascia in a um in a in an elaborate way in a way that allowed me to finally understand what this incredible aspect of our physiology um the many things that it's doing I realize this is a vast discussion that we could take several more hours but I'm not a fascia researcher right and yet I think as I recall you're one of the first people to talk about you know that the relationship telling people what that there's fascia that we have this thing called fascia um clearly an important part of our our physiology our ability to move to what extent do you think that um tight fascia quote unquote I'm probably offending many people in this moment tight fascia restricts our movement and that working on fascial release if or or manu mobilization thank you um can allow us to move better maybe better posture maybe even feel better there are a lot of theories um some probably wrong some probably right about what fascia can and can't do for us but what are some things about fascia that you find particularly interesting that you'd like to pass along I think what we should do is if you pull fascia out of the human movement equation human doesn't fails to stop moving right so the recent like we've just discovered fasha like that's not really entirely true um there's an really like 20year old set of videos by a guy who's he describes himself as a Soma uh his name is Gil Headley and he did these live dissections on the YouTube I don't even know if it's still there but he basically did all of this gross anatomy for free on the internet and he describes one of the first people really describe fascia as this sort of incredible you know connective tissue Network that envelops wraps you know stores energy communicates is intentionality in full disclosure I went to school in Boulder and I may have dated a girl who went to raling school and was a roler and Ida Ral was one of the first people to really talk about how can we mobilize fascia with touch so I was introduced to fascia in the 90s when I had raling done on me so when I'm trying to help someone think about pain a restore position and this is overly gross but it'll it'll create a framework for people we ask is this an environmental problem are you poorly hydrated because your tissues need to be hydrated to slide are you inflamed like that's why we talk about nutrition and we talk about sleep okay so we have this environmental piece then I I often will say hey do we have just a movement problem do you just have crappy technique like let's fix the technique first let's get you moving to the highest expression of the movement first hey turn your foot straighter let's let's let recate that joint can we can we have a better organization then we start to say because sometimes it's just a movement problem just you needed some queuing we say is this a joint capsule problem because capsule stiffness The Joint capsule is a bag of connect tissue that surrounds all your joints and it can account for huge chunks of your range of motion limitation so a lot of we do is we after we try to mobilize a joint tissue and again that's my own bias the way I was trained as an Australian trained manual therapist this mland school then we say well is this just a good oldfashioned muscle restriction and we call it muscle Dynamics cuz that includes High tone stress fear but trigar points are well documented phenomenon muscles get stiff they become fibrotic right you could have high tone trying to protect you all those reasons but that still could limit your range of motion and lastly we say sliding surfaces so instead of kind of talking about all the different layers of dermis and skin and fascia we say do the things that slide should are they sliding so if you grab your skin on your forehead it should slide in all the directions notice the skin should slide all the directions over your tendons right if I grab your typical person's Achilles and grab the skin over the Achilles it doesn't budge it's like they have an exoskeleton that's that fascial kind of compartment and it's seized it's adhered it's bound to the underlying surfaces which creates tissue restriction and higher tension so when we're mobilizing these tissues we're trying to keep tissues sliding and gliding that's an easy way of think about it nerves have to run through nerve tunnels taking huge breaths keeps all of those you know aspects of your trunk moving and we just need to be thinking in like a systems approach so sometimes if you went and saw an art practitioner and it didn't solve your problem is this Active Release therapy yeah okay it may not have been a fasal problem right if you went and saw someone who only worked on the muscles it may not have been a muscle problem if you went saw a chiropractor and they worked on your on your joint joint structures right or a good physio it may not be a joint restriction problem if you saw a coach and they couldn't queue you out of it it may not have been a so what we need to do is we recognize that if more squats just solved all the problems wouldn't we have solved all the problems if rolling on a roller had solved all the problems seems like we would have solved all the problems so I think what ends up happening is we want to put fascia equally as an important part of the system and one of the ways that we can directly impact that in a free way at home is to begin a conversation of just some simple myofascial mobilization in fact myofascial means muscle fascial but there are osteop fascial connections does the fascia you Glide over the bone there right we can look at the the the tendonous fascial connections and again do these tissues slide and glide the way they're supposed to slide and glide and that's a much easier way to look at it and I'm going to test and retest not with subjective pain but how is your range of motion and access to your range of motion thank you for that I've um Wanted to try roling for a long time and then a friend of mine who's a former Seal Team operator told me that at some point during the roll thing that he received that they put a glove on and went up his nostril and did some fascial relief on the release excuse me on the inside of his nose and it quote it was the most painful experience he ever had and I was like all right well I don't know if you know anyone in Naval special Warfare but they are they are so soft right I didn't say that Kelly said that um you know who you are my friends but I you know that I I confess um you know it's not like I avoid pain at all costs but that that made me think that um I might not want to do roling I also don't want someone putting their finger up my nose so I'm assuming that I could say hey I want I want try roll thing and I don't need to get because you hear this stuff like oh you know there's all this emotional release which you know there are other ways to get that the um I guess is it always painful is the question does it need to be painful his statement is pretty pretty M so pull let's pull ring out the side because I'm not a raler but let's just say that mobilizing your tissues doesn't have to be painful in fact it's likely that you'll experience some discomfort but let's talk about a couple guideposts for you number one you always have to be able to take a full breath right so if I'm mobilizing you or you're mobilizing yourself and you suddenly stop breathing you're going too deep so an easy way for you is to say hey do I have can I Breathe Here number two I like to have volutional contraction so if I'm mobilizing someone or someone's doing something I should be able to flex them out I should have control over that if the pain or depth or pressure is putting too much load on the system where I literally lose normal muscular control what am I doing right and then you know those two pieces can I take a breath here do I have control here those go a long way to keeping me in the bounds and then we tend to not work on a tissue longer than 5 minutes just because I want to get the rest of it tomorrow and if you give me 10 minutes to work that's incredible we like to put the soft tissue work before we go to bed and what we found was that we had better adherence no one's doing anything productive in then 10 minutes before they go to the bedroom number two like a child when you put a child to bed you're like first do we take a bath and we read the book then we go to bed right your brain is like I know what comes next so if you do this rolling or on your some soft tissue work self massage you are training your brain to know what comes next we find that when people have engaged in massage or self- massage they don't stand up and want to fight anyone they're very relaxed if you've ever gone to a spa and had a massage you don't go out and snatch or get into a fight afterwards you're so chill bro so we found it as a great way to as Jill Miller says switch on the off switch that's a beautiful way of talking about that how do I tell myself to shift out of this you know fight or flight into coming down 5 minutes per body part start anywhere on the leg start any what's stiff what's asking can I breathe can I contract you're going to see that that's a really simple way to start getting same input and not all your tissues are the same if you come to me with knee pain I'm going to want to be able to look at your R your positions but I'm also going to want to be able to stay on your quads I mean my full body weight and if you can't take that I'm calling that incomplete and those people out there who are going to be like whoa that's heavy duty you have not worked with my population who have monster thighs on are thick and fibrotic and it takes real weight so we all have different sensitivities but if I respect your ability to take a breath and contract then all of a sudden we're we're we're upregulating what I recommend is you go to Thailand you get a thae massage from a 65-year-old master woman who is weighs 109 pounds and when she is working on your quads and you tap out she's like no I'm not done here if you felt your quads you're going to realize how low the bar is all right um heat and cold you were one of the first people that told me Hey listen Cold's great cold plunges cold showers are great for shifting your State uh for resilience training um fun it's fun um I swam with L's pool this morning did the breath hold cold lapse it's fun I'm going to put in quotation marks yeah sometimes it's type too fun um it definitely will shift one's state for many hours afterwards for reasons we Now understand but you were one of the first people to point out to me that for injuries often times it's better to profuse the tissue and that heat sometimes perhaps is the more favorable tool if you had to pick one that's right so what you I think even talked about that there is research to show that cold water immersion can attenuate training effects if done in the six to8 hours after hypertrophy and strength training because of its potent anti-inflammatory properties prevents some of the inflammation that would prompt the adaptation response and put simply if your goal is bigger muscles and getting stronger don't do immersion based deliberate cold exposure in the six to eight hours after your training fine to do it on other days fine to do it beforehand in fact athletes at Stanford do that on the basis of a lot of work from Craig heler and others F to not do it at all if you don't want to do it again I'm not a I'm not a um uh I'm not going to die on The Sword of of cold plunging um but it can attenuate or even prevent those adaptations but at other times it's a great tool for reducing inflammation shifting one's mental and physical state in the great Direction look it always sucks to get in the thing the whole point is you feel much better when you get out than you did before you ever got in that's the simplest way to put it I a middle-aged guy who wants to be the best middle-aged mountain biker in my neighborhood is my timing of my plunge going to affect my ability to be that mediocre athlete no so stop people are like when's the optimal time I'm like when's it work for you does is that first thing in the morning Juliet found that if she got hot and plunged in the night she was like woken up and fired up and red she like I'm not going to sleep now and I get hot and cold hot and cold it's like someone hits emergency break right so first of all when does it work for you right second of all if there is a performance concern we try to put it as far away from training as we can that's what we say training in the evening plunge before if you like you train the the morning morning Plunge in the evening like get cold that's cool but what you hinted at is the same reasons why we don't ice injuries because it limits our body's ability to to heal so it rate limits and it might do it by phasal constriction your body eventually your body is going to warm up anyway so one of the things we like to say is your body either heals at the rate of a human being or it heals slower so there's no such thing as a fast healer you're just oh you're really good at healing at the rate of human physiology and the rest of us are doing dumb things that are Li rate limiting our healing nutrition sleep right when we are talking about anyone after surgery or injury our Benchmark in the Line in the Sand is8 hours of laying in bed without looking at your phone that's minimum and I don't care if you're sleeping because resting is the next best thing but I can't actually understand inputs and outputs and let me be super clear if you're trying to grow a body learn a skill change your body composition get stronger heal that all rhymes with eight hours we look seven as our minimum and of course you're human being you're going to get by I was stressed out last night wanted to come on this show with my friend Andrew and do a good job like I didn't get great sleep but I'm a human being I'm still going to show up so what's nice then is we can start to say okay what can we control in terms of managing and upregulating boosting maximal healing rate for humans and it turns out cold water may not be the best icing something might suppress prostag gland in release right which means that you can think of it as you have these circulating stem cells and again sorry everyone get this just very cursory and we need the chemical signalers from the injured damaged tissue to call those things to be but if I ice that and suppress that those some of those cells can go swinging on past there was a great study I saw a million years ago and it looked at ibuprofin usage in Australian military tactical athletes who had bad ankle sprains and those athletes who are given ibuprofen which does the same thing as ice suppresses prostag gland release right cuts off some of those chemal signals were back faster than their counterparts who did not have the ibuprofen but they had chronic ankle instability because they did not have a sufficient healing response because they had shut that healing response down so what we find is look your body will wait until you it warms back up but if you think you're going to do angine neogenesis and make new capillaries and modulate all these things by slapping a non-specific ice pad for a non-specific amount of time over a non-specific tissue you got to be kidding me and so it's really Mickey Mouse does ice help for margaritas that are warm yes open heart surgery yes right waking you up in the morning waking you up in the morning hey I have a kid who needs a placebo I can numb that thing and give my kid some Placebo ice that's great definitely can work for pain control because as soon as you're numb you can't feel anything but what's going to happen when you pull that thing off we're going to come back so we've found that we have much better and again instead of saying that's bad we're turning out and saying we have so many better tools now to manage congestion because that's really what we're trying to do with ice and healing is we're trying to stop swelling right but is swelling a mistake by the body and chances are it's not really a mistake again two and a half million years of evolution this stuff's pretty awesome but what we know is failure to move and evacuate that swelling is a problem so when we get people on non- fatiguing muscle contraction nmes devices like the h-wave or something like that we find that we can actually decongest and keep moving in controlled ways M and we have much better clinical outcomes than we do with we ice what about heating pads hot water bottles sauna do you sit in the sauna yes I do I love the sauna how often are you in the sauna whenever I can you know and sometimes it's short sessions and sometimes it's super hot sessions and sometimes I just get hot and cold a couple times and I try like you said earlier I'm not after some specific adaptation response the Saun is a great way for us to chill out and hang out and sometimes we're bored and we got to make dinner or move on so I you know I try to sauna if there's anything I do I sauna a lot bigger the engine the bigger the braks then it's for me it's such a big break you mentioned leair I've I've seen L Drag The Assault bike into the sauna something most people probably shouldn't do cuz they would die of a hypothermia but we call that Restrepo it's the worst place on Earth it's a it's an interesting tool though the the heat I find that if I get the sauna uncomfortably hot and then force myself to breathe super slowly only through my nose so that I don't actually feel like a burning sensation on the inside of my nostrils and I just do that for um you know 10 15 minutes that it's wonderful stress resilience training how great is that but very different than the cold plunge where you can either muscle through it or distract yourself or whatever in the heat you know your heart rate's going up and there's this temptation to I'm like um to follow that heart rate toward a a more elevated stress State and so I find that you can get very very hot obviously be be safe about this folks um but still maintain a lot of calm and I think it's a wonderful tool but you have to kind of work at it and I enjoy this by the way so people are probably think here you go again like why not just enjoy the sauna um but I like to listen to Gregorian chants or something in there and do this like very like how even and calm can I stay I love at 215 or or 220 um and I wear I wear the cap so those higher Heats don't don't register to the brain you you will drive yourself out eventually your brain is going to just I what's driv drives me out the sa now is I wret I actually like feel like I'm going to vomit because I've gotten so hot my brain stem is like bro you can just override so I'm like got to get it and I get out of the sauna and then you what one of the reasons I love the cold so much we're jump in our C our pool or cold plunges I can get back in the son right right it's the contrast of I try to do it once a week Sonic cold Sonic cold Sonic once a week you know again not training for any specific thing except to be able to go back to joo's house CU I did sauna at joo's house with some family members of HS and friends and I think they wanted to see when I would they want to crush you so they went I think they cranked that thing to like 22230 and they call he got me on this there I ended up down on the floor you know and they were they were teasing me because it's obviously cooler down on the floor than it is up top and so they call that the huberman spot the Wimpy spot but um yeah he's a beast with the song everyone it's not a contest and one it is it it is in the willink household I'll tell you it absolutely one of the things I like about the Heat and the cold is that it it informs me about my Readiness State because just like my CO2 tolerance my breath holds are very short when I'm stressed and under recovered my heat tolerance drops dramatically and so does my cold tolerance it's easier to pick up really fast I start shivering right away I'm like whoa I've been in here for 30 seconds I'm already shivering I'm like huh another piece of day that says maybe I need to make it a 70% day in the gym and move I don't have to take a day off we believe julette and I believe in this thing called desire to train we wake up every day like you probably self-medicated with some exercise as kids right and we we start thinking about what we're going to exercise what are we going to do we're going to run bikes what we do what we lift like wait when we wake up we start thinking about when are we going to do it and we wake up on some days and it's not there and what we ask ourselves is it not there why is it not there is it me I should be there we should go train anyway but we really try to listen to that voice and when there's no desire to train it's really strange how it correlates with crap heat tolerance crap CO2 tolerance crap cold tolerance and I think it's a nice way of understanding yourself from sort of a third- party objective measure especially as you get good at this you're like wow that really sucked today yeah I love that I think um assessing one's degree of kind of forward Center of mass for for effort is is great um I'm borrowing this analogy from somebody else I didn't come up with this um he said you're with all things you're either you know back on your heels flat footed or um forward Center of mass and I think we've heard a lot about you know trying to encourage ourselves to always be forward Center of mass what I'm hearing today is that great to do that sometimes great sometimes to back off but to just explore the full range of um for lack of a better way to put it sort of um emotional range of motion you know yeah and remember ultimately all this is supposed to be additive right and it's supposed to inoculate Me by creating a framework that makes more durable my body in my my my relationships I mean we we didn't even talk about the fact that the sauna is like it's just glue for people it allows people to come together I think one of the things I've noticed with my male friends is that it gives us a place like once a week where we get together because it's so hot we Al we're all super vulnerable and we talk the truth barel we talk with our friends and we kind of share stories and can be talk about our lives and so it creates a framework for that and if that was the benefit of the sauna I'm in just that alone right that my wife and I feel more connected after taking a on together I'm like well who cares about the heat shock proteins and Alzheimer's that's probably important too but I like having a lot of bottom things and I think we it's easy for us to sort of so hyper science and Hyper tactic things that we forget the whole point of the brain is to be around other brains that's it that's why the brain exists and then those brains go do rad in the world together and uh sometimes it's that simple and when we start throwing that filter on it becomes a lot more sustainable I'm not interested in being 110 I'm interested in being durable enough to take the hits on my way to 110 I love that um some of my best friendships have been forged in the SAA and not by pushing ourselves necessarily just come the thing you know it's so cool um I know that some of my uh New Zealand teams have a Cava um they call it recovery and sometimes they'll share have a Cava ceremony and drink a little Cava and then jump in the sauna and boy really binds the boys you know that really creates a down regulation a fact I mean it's so you know I I think again my own bias because I love this stuff is that I think all of it is about physical input so if we took a sort of macro step back what we say is what does your physical practice look like tell me about your physical practice well I get move my body and I try to eat a fruit and some protein before I get out the door and I walk all day long and I try not to sit in one period of place for all long period of time and then I get home and if I'm lucky enough to exercise I do and then I sat on the floor and I roll a little bit but that's a full practice you walked you got sunlight you you know what I mean and that I think is a much better way of thinking about this versus sort of let me add another line of code to your programming where now you're doing three sets of 10 in this thing what are your thoughts on nutrition you seem to be pretty uh balanced about this um before we started recording you were talking about some meatloaf recipes that sound pretty amazing clearly you love food I'm not going to say I'm the best at meatloaf but I maybe seven out of 11 times Bamboo Terrace bench Champion I'm going to get a tattoo but it's fine what uh you enjoy food love food um so you're not you like to eat and um you cook a bit as well um most people feel I think kind of overwhelmed oh yeah at the discussions about nutrition now we're trying to get a gram of protein per pound of body weight which I subscribe to but if I'm supposed to spread that out across the day sometimes I'm doing that sometimes I'm not I like fruits and vegetables did you feel like a failure because you didn't have ground I mean honestly if it can feel for people like oh I didn't do it no I think if people make getting high quality high protein to calorie ratio Foods as the foundation of their diet and then eating some vegetables and eating some fruit whoa bro what about the peels you're going to kill people that I love that Ban's dangerous I'll eat the I'll eat the orange peel if it's a really good orange I will people who know me I'm I've gotten some wide eyes at meals where I'll take the lemons out of my drink I'll just eat the whole thing down I don't care someone will tell me why it's going to kill me but I don't eat the seeds while I eat the peel too um so some vegetables fruit and then some starches you know per energetic requirements Andor real life like I'm not going to stay away from the sourdough bread because I don't need a starch that I have a little bit of it like you know I feel like we've lost our rational approach to eating um because people feel these you know these quantifiable metrics of you know calories and protein they're important clearly but I've always known you to be somebody who's very balanced about the occasional ice cream yes steak but also vegetables I mean a why do you think that theut nurition conversation has gotten so distracted even contentious and B what do you do and you know if you were going to raise a kid you've raised kids if you're going to raise a kid and and say Here's what like balanced nutrition looks like to you okay I'm not calling you nutrition to you how do you see this picture but what I I want to point out is that if we're going to have a conversation remember my my real job day job is high performance I'm going to have to talk about body composition and I'm going to have to talk about fueling do you have enough carbs on board to do what we're going to do are you eating to recover to reduce the session cost right how do we minimize the sort of the physiologic cost of this training this competition and that's all wrapped around nutrition nutrition I already hinted at I'm going to have to talk and ultimately ask you get a blood panel and look at make sure that you have everything on board so that your tissues are tissues and can handle the loading we're prescribing them so I didn't want to get into nutrition at all because it's always about body composition for me and I'm like that's the most boring reason why we uh Sean Stevenson uh wrote a beautiful book about creating a table culture and a culture on eating for your family so for me the functional unit of change is the household that's the place where I want to make and put all my energy and time that's how we'll transform Society one household at a time but sitting down with your kids the research around that eating with your kids like twice or three times a week is phenomenal right like cooking is is beautiful I have to become more nuan because if I have a team I'm working with like uh we had a tournament two weeks ago at Stanford we played four games and the that's four Collegiate nationally ranked teams that were playing like badasses how do I fuel those women how do I get them what do they want to eat what makes them feel good what makes them feel bad how do we balance all of that like I found out that putting food on a table with a tablecloth increased calories again as a high performance for me I'm like how are the ways that I can be thinking about this from a practical standpoint my personal thing is that we focus on trying to create this has been really useful for Julia and I an objective measure 08 to1 grams of protein which means I don't measure anymore I'm per pound of body weight I'm 51 years old per pound of body weight so what does that mean means that I really try to prioritize protein every meal super simple and I try not to eat one protein I try to eat all the proteins right that's probably better I try not to choose personally very fatty proteins because my genetics don't really support it if I want to see triglycerides and and things go through the roof then I'll you know watch me eat eggs and butter and steak like keto gives me diarrhea so what I'll say is I try to go for leaner proteins there and then on the fruits and vegetables because I think we have a real problem with not enough micronutrients again talking about tissue health and definitely not enough fiber those are huge problems and if I get 800 gram of fruits and vegetables this is a a nutrition strategy promoted by our friend e sinowski of at optimiz me nutrition she put this 800 gram challenge based on some research and it changed everything because suddenly I was I was like oh my God I got to eat more food I have to eat more fruits and vegetables and I was stuffing myself with fruits and vegetables getting enough protein that I was like uh I guess there's no room for a cookie you know and what I really liked about that it was agnostic about your cultural preferences it didn't matter if you're a vegan didn't matter if you're vegetarian didn't matter if you were carnivore you want to do carnivore plus berries knock yourself right out it gave people permission to have their food identities but it also the met the minimums and then we can dose up and dose Down based on what your performance needs are and this is 800 gram not of carbohydrate this iseg 800 gram of like four Big Apples gotcha a banana is like 80 to 100 gram okay yeah if you want to be real dangerous you ate eight eight bananas today you could die I mean you could die and um a big salad with you know Les cucumber tomato and probably probably 2 to 300 gram okay so then you you'd also want to get some fruit maybe another maybe some um cruciferous vegetables Etc check this out again I'm just going to do some boy math here Starbucks cookie delicious really 300 c 300 calories I'm going call it delicious right a pound of cherries is 230 calories so eat a pound of cherries and tell me you're like ah I still want something sweet a pound of melon was it like 220 calories a pound of melon so calorically not very dense right but nutritionally super dense so we're end up loading a ton of more food on and it really does prioritize those things and from a performance standpoint one of our friends is this incredible nutritionist at at Michigan football Abigail is amazing there and she will tell me about how she's using nutrition as intervention for sports performance and she'll have men come up to her and say Abigail I pooped today and they're she's like yeah that's great you know you should poop every day and they're like no no you understand I I pooped yesterday too and it's the first time these kids have pooped consecutively they don't poop regularly and I think again if I'm just trying to get out in the weeds and talk about what's normal and not normal we should talk about you didn't eat fiber and she's like wait until you poop twice in one day and they were like that's crazy never in my whole life what was the difference is they started eating fruits and vegetables and fiber and when we start to create those benchmarks it's a lot easier for me to see inputs and outputs and then we can argue about can you choke down 100 grams of carbs an hour because you're my Elite cyclist you know I think you'd be shocked at how my a lot of my athletes have changed their relationship around food because it serves their needs it's not their identity around control and it's something that Julie and I have been very cautious of is if you have two daughters just speaking we're really concerned about creating dysfunctional patterns or relationships to food because in this Fitness space it can be real gnarly yeah I see the progression from you know sitcoms of the type that we grew up on to reality TV shows to social media where social media can do so much good um educationwise Etc connection but it's basically a a reality TV show that everyone's been able to cast themselves in if they want and certain characters are casting their you know physique certain fers are casting their outrageous behavior and you know we's all in this reality TV show called social media I I think that's really the the best way to describe it you know when people start to feel like oh wow the these people are getting attention for this reason or that reason it it um creates a gravitational pull toward people behaving a certain way and then obviously um some of that can be really self-destructive um do you win health I mean this is a great question I ask people so like you shredded Down super dysfunctional eating you can't go out and eat with friends you don't drink anything with calories like it's really gnarly to be hyper lean and then what I'll say is when you took your shirt off did you win Instagram did you win because you got another 6070 years on this planet how does that work we don't really dieet we'll manipulate macros to take weight on put weight off players in season out of season you we'll have we'll have really good athletes say I think I should lose four pounds the next two weeks for this thing and I'm like hold up I'm not going to put you in another stressor when our we're trying to like let's go ahead and talk about body composition after the season but ultimately when we really get people on board with how food has the potential to enrich their relationships how fun it is to cook how fun it is to prep how fun it is to serve other people then we have this really different relationship with fueling and that's that's really remarkable but it is really easy to say I won and I'm like okay so this 90-day fast there are so many Fitness things out there where they start with a fast or brutal calorie restriction and I'm like that's your jam to get people lean fast is just to slam off the calories like we know what's going to happen how many people have done some kind of 30-day 90-day thing and the next day it's like they're off the rails so if you're doing some body recomp and then you're off the rails for me I'm like I don't think that was very good because I got a this is a long season we're playing I think it's I have to be careful here because I realize this gets into some issues when I did an episode about uh anorexia I learned that first of all anorexia has existed for centuries um this idea that it's more prominent now with social media actually the numbers don't bear out um what does bear out is that it is the most deadly the most deadly by far of all the psychiatric illnesses Oh see it leads to death in in in a far greater uh percentage of cases than any other psychiatric illness including bipolar where people often commit suicide a great great much higher percentage of people commit suicide who are bi bipolar Etc so it's it's a really serious thing and yeah we assume that social media has made that worse but there's this now cluster of all these different eating disorders that don't qualify as full-blown anorexia neosa sort of like ADHD now we understand people are having attention deficit issues that might not be clinical ADHD but that cluster around it in like people's adults and children's inability to hold their attention on an idea or topic for any appreciable amount of time so it's a very serious thing I love that today you've talked about enjoying your training like really enjoying your training all aspects the resistance part the cardiovascular part the mobility part you know the in the evening getting down on the floor also enjoying eating with people enjoying the sauna I mean I think you know people see the big guy that you are the the amazing track record you have of working with all these incredible athletes and you're you're quite accomplished athlete yourself and I think this is the first time for me anyway that I realize like you you are thinking about how to make this whole thing pleasurable and mesh it with real life which I'm realizing now shouldn't come as a surprise because you have a family a flourishing family in addition to a flourishing business with the ready State and and so forth I think if there's one message that really comes through over and over again today it's like how can you make Fitness and Nutrition and health part of your life but not let it take over your life or your mind in a way that isn't healthy yeah um thank you for that and if that's coming across at all I think we're we're doing a better job and I would say certainly tempered as I've gotten more reasonable you know I think we get older and you can see a little bit more of the Horizon and you you know you start to wrap your hands around how are we going to solve these problems in these different places and what is sustainable you know I really think that that's you know we see quick inputs and outputs that are high levels of sports performance and simultaneously again I I want to take those lessons and transmute them to my own household in a really sustainable fun way the nutrition piece is such a a dangerous one and young right now jul and I are very obsessed with youth sports and spending time with seeing if we can improve that experience for families so they come out unharmed and you know Red's relative energy deficiency and Sport you know is where we start to see that kids are not eating enough to fuel activity and their growing bod simultaneously and it's really hard on their physiologies and we it starts to show up with loss periods it starts to show up with stress fractures right and we start to see sort of this some de degradation in sort of the the body's tissues but can really crash a lot of problems and you know Stacy Sims is probably the first person to really put it on my radar of hey you're a physio coach I need you to become an expert with the people that you're working with you know are you eating enough support and and I see the some of the elite women I work with Elite women really battle this is what the body I need to get paid and to win World Championships and that's not the body that people want on the Instagram and you know you know should I have a salad after this training I'm like we just played for 3 hours no you're not going to eat a salad like go get this big ass burrito and then we'll talk about your salad next you know so it sounds like the athletes are undereating and my understanding anyway the statistics which I know is confusing but you know potentially not thinking about food at the right times and within the general population of non-athletes especially youth however it seems that people are overc consuming calories so there seems to be two two populations clustering out here we have a this reminds me we have a rule at our our house for dinner we have a three vegetable rule uh this is from a woman we work with Margaret Garvy who cooks a protein whatever that is and has also three vegetables and that's where she starts and we have I had one daughter who is like Gourmet Chef Georgia is just a total badass you know G and then I have Caroline who is the pickiest human being on the like is brown I'm not e you know and and she's getting better but when we had three vegetables suddenly what we saw was that she might eat one right and we could start to have exposure but I think if we crowd out some of the because I we don't want to have a restrictive house right but you know if we crowd out some of the other Foods um we found it was a lot easier for us to say this is what we're eating and we eat this together as a family and then if those other Foods I mean your teenagers are going to leave the house and eat whatever they want just just be clear everybody so you might as well stuff them with the good stuff at home I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about supplements um these days we hear a lot about creatine creatine creatine creatine I I like creatine been taking it for years um we'll occasionally do a wash out where I just kind of let let a bunch of water out of my body why not and then get back to it I I won do it for any specific reason I just do it I travel and forget to bring creatines I'm okay yeah but most of the time I'm taking 5 to 10 grams a day okay um we've heard about the Body Benefits the brain benefits um for athletes and just quote unquote exercisers the typical person listening to this podcast um do you recommend creatine what are what are some of the things that in your household I'm I'm getting this picture and I've been in your home and I I will say that the spirit in your home is a wonderful one um Brian Mackenzie and I showed up more or less unannounced at one point and like the there's it's a it's a delightful thing like people's Spirits are it's a space station it's a it's a space station of stoke and like you want to be part of it you can come in thank you it's a it's a great environment and um it was very warming to see that and and the way that you embrace all these different aspects of life and you're it's busy and it's hectic and it's fun and people care for one another and they're direct with one another but in a way that's really supportive it's really a in my mind a great model for for a home and and it's really uh it stayed with me and it's really a pleasure to reflect on yeah it's a team effort in there for sure so um I'll just ask this what supplements do you think are um if not necessary then highly desirable for most people and then for athletes and maybe because we get this question a lot now especially after Stacy came on the podcast for your the female athletes you work with um in particular are there supplements that um add on to that that initial batch so I think we we can divide these things of like in to food like things right and then sort of performance yeah like whey protein it's just a protein replacement high high quality high protein to calorie ratio that's right and if you don't handle wayy like my athletes I'm like let me introduce you these vegetarian proteins and that's because you're having a hard time timing your meals or just getting enough protein because you sometimes you just don't feel like it so great great utilization there um for Caroline she gets omegas at night cuz she doesn't want to have any accidental fish burp at school she's a teenager so she takes them before she goes to bed and we're really interested in brain health and there's some early research and again not my expertise that I've heard of read about talked to people about that vitamin D creatine and omegas might help attenuate symptoms of concussion if they they get hit right so post pre so those things are on Caroline she gets creatine every day she gets an Omega every day and she gets vitamin D and some of that is probably get S vitamin D during the summer because we I could pull it out but we live in northern climbs and they're indoors and there's good research supplement I think Dan Garner had a great piece just talking about vitamin D supplementation in the military and the decrease of like risk of of of fractures in the foot just with vitamin D so that's the start for me I take a good multi because I'm like I'm just going to cover the basis you know and um then you can look I think the next sort of veillance of interest is have you had a blood panel how are your vitamin B levels is there anything we need to do based on your environment or your genetics and then I think it gets real in the weeds past that and again play around with that uh one of my super smart friends was like I think you should take a Statin a small dose Statin once a week and I was like all right so I was like better take some Cokey 10 with that it's an experiment I'm running right downsides are low I'm getting my blood panels talk to my physician but so CoQ10 is on the menu for me just to make sure I don't have anything and so I think suddenly what we should be looking at is how do I round out my family doesn't eat fish so we're not getting enough s of Megos from those sources and no one will eat Walnuts but I'm the only one to eat Walnuts so you know how do I round out my nutrition with some supplementation and is there a benefit for some other things that with my genetics or with what's going on like J has a mutated mtfhr Gene right and so we are always watching B vitamins for her right so because poor meth right poor methat exactly right J star is his wife that's right sorry jay stizzle CEO you guys have such an awesome relationship you guys have Pok fun in one another you're clearly awesome companions to one another and you do great great work together I am uh the broken anchor of the relationship I like so she is uh you know what's really interesting is I have I'm a little bit like you I think I'm excitable I get obsessed with things it's super fun go down rabbit holes I like to experiment and jar is like the true north like no that sounds fishy we're not doing that you know like I came home one time and I was like you know what this cow's milk is out of here our family is only drinking goat milk I only had the best goat milk I just had the best goat milk and Julet was like sure that's going to and I gave some goat milk to Georgia and she's like hucked it across the room she's a baby and then I the goat milk and like vomited into the sink and I had goat milk on my lip and I and Juliet just is so patient by saying huh I wonder if that's a good idea I wonder if you will will stick around so so she's the rudder she is 100% the rudder she is a three-time world champion everyone she's mut she's a rower at Cal and she is my training partner she's the greatest training partner ever had we use training as another way of spending time together love it thanks for sharing a little bit of the picture of your home it matches exactly my experience um and uh chaos a little bit of chaos and a ton of love and um I've been quoting him a lot lately uh I cannot take any credit for this but Naval who is you know famous on uh various podcasts he says um you know what what are we really shooting for in life it's um a fit energetic body this is nval not me by the way he said fit energetic body a calm mind and resources we got to have resources and a home full love so I don't know from yeah I think that's the list spend the rest of your life working on those and you're going to have a really it's going to be really fun and I I just want to remind people you hear me say it again that they should all be enjoyable and it is fun to track it's also you know which which devices am I wearing right now I'm not wearing a single device you know because I want to feel and sometimes I track and sometimes I don't track and how am I feeling and ultimately everything is really coming down to how do I come to understand my own process and my interaction with the world process I think I'm getting better at 5 wanted of knowing I don't need six cookies and I really need to get more fruits and vegetables and sleep and I don't need a device to tell me that love it well Kelly do starett thank you so much for coming on here today and sharing with us so much wisdom we covered so much you covered so much I mean pelvic floor fascia cold heat movement patterns you give us a ton of practical tools getting down on the floor sit stand and on and on um but a small portal into the vast amount of knowledge you have in that head of yours and I just have to say that you know it's been a delight today because these little bits have come through about who I know you to be in the in the rest of the world this is the real world we just happen to have microphones in front of us the rest of the world and you've been at this a while this business

Title: Do You Need to Weight Train to Failure?
Published: 2024-12-06 19:08:50 UTC
Description:
This excerpt is from the Huberman Lab episode titled "Dr. Layne Norton: Tools for Nutrition & Fitness." It covers what the peer-reviewed research says about exercise, nutrition, supplementation, and health. Here we are discussing if resistance training needs to be done "to failure" — the inability to further move the resistance in good form for that set. It turns out the answer is relevant if you are seeking hypertrophy and/or strength.

Keep in mind that resistance training has been recommended by numerous guests on the podcast for both women and men regardless of whether you're seeking hypertrophy, or simply strength increases. In fact, resistance training is turning out to be one of the best ways to improve your immediate and long-term health and longevity per se.

Transcript Language: English
Is going to failure more effective than not going to failure? It's going to generate a lot of discussion in the comments, I can't wait to see it. So, I'm going cite quite a bit of work from my powerlifting coach, Zac Robinson, because he is at FAU, just finished his PhD, and did a lot of meta-regressions and meta-analyses on this exact topic. So, I'll give you the answers first that are straight down the line scientific answers, and then I'll explain things. For muscular hypertrophy, you need to get close to failure, but you probably don't need to train to failure to maximize hypertrophy, but you've got to get pretty close. You can be stronger, but to maximize strength, you're probably better off not touching failure very often. So, there are a few studies now looking at this, showing that I think there was one study recently, and I can't remember the exact details, but that I remember it being pretty well-designed. And the takeaway was hypertrophy was similar between the groups, but the group that went to failure or stayed a few reps shy of failure actually got stronger compared to the group that was taking most sets to failure. And did they control for total volume of work- Yes, so. Okay, 'cause I can imagine not goin' to failure, you can do more sets, because you've got. And that's exactly- More quote unquote gas in the tank, right? And practically, that may be a benefit of stopping shy of failure, right? But yeah, they control for those variables, so when we talk about volume, the way we define that is essentially number of hard sets, which a hard set would be a set close to failure. The general consensus is within five reps of failure is considered a hard set. Now, what I will tell people is that may not sound like much, most people have never truly pushed themselves to failure.

Title: How to Defeat Jet Lag, Shift Work & Sleeplessness | Huberman Lab Essentials
Published: 2024-12-05 13:00:19 UTC
Description:
In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore science-backed protocols to combat jet lag, manage shift work, and optimize sleep across different stages of life.  

I discuss “temperature minimum” — a simple and reliable measurement that helps you quickly adjust to new time zones and counteract the negative effects of nocturnal shift work. I also provide actionable tools for regulating sleep and wake cycles in babies and new parents.  

The episode emphasizes the critical role of circadian rhythms, influenced by factors like light exposure, temperature regulation, and eating schedules. Practical tools include using light to shift your circadian clock, understanding the role of temperature in sleep, and adopting strategies to improve rest without medication. Whether you’re a shift worker, a parent of a newborn, or someone facing sleep challenges, this episode offers valuable guidance for enhancing recovery and overall well-being.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is about jet lag, shift work. And we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work, and make life easier for the new parent, as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, et cetera. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower. And we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24-hour rhythm. And that clock is entrained, meaning, it is matched to the external light-dark cycle, which is, no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the Earth takes 24 hours. So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening we catch a little sunlight, and then at night, we're in complete darkness, we will be, more or less, perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights and this other thing that we call life demands. So today, we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from a circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? You basically want to get as much light, ideally, sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24-hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24-hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, a good number to shoot for, as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, maybe, but before 9:00 AM, assuming you're waking up sometime between 5:00 and 8:00 AM. The mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth. And that system sums, meaning, it adds photons. It's a very slow system. So here, we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons, but not all at once. So what do you do? You go outside. Going outside, even on a cloudy day, could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning, how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough, some people have sent me pictures from Northern England, it's just not bright enough in winter, then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can, in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting. And the reason for that, of course, is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes. Because here's the diabolical thing-- while we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10:00 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. So let's talk about shifting clocks, because for the jet-lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag. Today, I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work, or pleasure, or anytime you're jet-lagged. And I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet-lagged. Many of you are jet-lagged. You're jet-lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night. You're jet-lag because you're waking up at different times a day. Your jet-lagged because you're exercise is on a chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. But there are some simple things that you can do. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. There are quality, peer-reviewed papers, showing that jet lag will shorten your life. Jet lag is a serious thing. Now, here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward. OK? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity have shown that traveling East takes more years off your life than traveling West. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves, why? Why is that? And it turns out, there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord, and body, and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. It turns out that human beings and probably, most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it. You can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling East has a number of different features associated with it that because you're traveling East, you're trying to go to bed earlier. As a Californian, if I go to New York City, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours earlier, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation, where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go, or forage for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrine to stay awake, whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. All right. Well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say, you're not going eastward or westward, but you're going North or South. So if you go from, for instance, Washington, DC to Santiago, Chile, you're just going North and South. You're not really moving into a different time zone. You're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And it turns out that jet lag has two elements-- travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people, not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that, because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high, actually, in children. Then it becomes cyclic during puberty, meaning, it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted. And we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, et cetera, meal times. So jet lag gets worse as we age. I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy, or at least, as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps, one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24-hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to 2 hours before your average waking time. Temperature, actually, is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth, in trains or collectively, pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that, there should be an immediate, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron. They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out. And then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days. It's what's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock. However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes, 6:30, sometimes, 7:00. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before, as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM, which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM, and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake up time, my temperature minimum shifts too. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what, the next night, I'm going to want to stay up later. And I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point, not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest, and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. So now, you can start to see and understand the logic of this system. You can now start to shift that temperature according to your travel needs. Here's one way in which you might do that. Let's say, I am going to travel to Europe, which is nine hours ahead, typically, from California. I would want to determine my temperature minimum, which, for me, is about 4:30 AM, maybe 5:00 AM. And I would want to start getting up at about 5:30 AM and getting some bright light exposure, presumably, from artificial sources because the sunlight isn't going to be out at that time, maybe even exercising as well, maybe even eating a meal at that time. You would want to start doing that two or three days before travel, because once I land in Europe, chances are, just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock. Some people say, get sunlight in your eyes when you land, but that's not going to work, because one of two things is likely to happen. With a nine-hour shift like that, either I'm going to view sunlight at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone, the time in which my circadian clock can't be shifted, or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight at a time that corresponds to the four to six hour window before my temperature minimum. So it's going to shift me in exactly the opposite direction that I want to go. So it can be very, very challenging for people to adjust to jet lag. So you need to ask, am I traveling East or am I traveling West? Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock? Remember, viewing light, exercise, and eating in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum will delay your clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising, you don't have to do all three, but some combination of those, in the four to six hours after your temperature minimum, will advance your clock. And this is a powerful mechanism by which you can shift your clock anywhere from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable. That means your temperature minimum is going to shift out as much as three hours, which can make it such that you can travel all the way to Europe. And in as long as you've prepared for a day or so, by doing what I described, back home, and then doing it when you arrive, you can potentially accomplish the entire shift within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. And so a lot of people are landing in Europe, getting sunlight in their eyes, and throwing their clock out of whack, or not shifting their clock at all. This brings me to the other thing that's highly recommended, and I've mentioned this before, but you want to eat on the local meal schedule. If it's in your practice to fast, fast. That's fine. But when you eat, you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness. OK. I talked about traveling eastward, but we haven't talked about traveling westward. Let's say, you're traveling from New York to California or from Europe to California. The challenge there tends to be, how can you stay up late enough? Now, some people are able to do this, because, as I mentioned earlier, the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired such that it's easier to stay up later than we would naturally want to, than it is to go to sleep earlier. So let's say, you land. And it's 4:00 PM. And you're just dying. You're in California. You came from Europe. It's 4:00 PM. And you really, really want to go to sleep. That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise, and sunlight can shift you. If it's after your temperature peak, then viewing sunlight around 6:00 PM, or 8:00 PM, or artificial light, if there isn't sunlight, will help shift you later. It's going to delay your clock. And you're going to be able to stay up later. The worst thing you can do is take a nap that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour. I do this routinely. And then wake up four hours later, or you wake up and it's midnight, and you can't fall back asleep. You really want to avoid doing that. So provided, it's not excessive amounts, stimulants like caffeine in coffee or tea can really help you push past that afternoon barrier and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule and eating on the local schedule as well. A number of people have asked about the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness. Melatonin is this hormone that's released from the pineal gland. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin during development is also responsible for timing the secretion of certain hormones that are vitally important for puberty. Does melatonin control the onset of puberty? Not directly, but indirectly. Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus, also roughly above the roof of your mouth in your brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting because it stimulates the release of another hormone called luteinizing hormone, which, in females, causes estrogen to be released within the ovaries, it's involved in reproductive cycles, and in males, stimulates testosterone from the Sertoli cells of the testes. Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH, Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone, and therefore, is inhibitory to LH, Luteinizing Hormone, and therefore, is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen. Just no two ways about it. So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness when you want to fall asleep in the new location that you've arrived. You can't fall asleep. You take melatonin. And it helps you fall asleep. It does not help you stay asleep. In addition to that, melatonin has been touted as the best way to shift your circadian clock. I'm happy to go on record, saying, look, if you need melatonin. And you can work with a doctor or somebody who really understands circadian and sleep biology, go for it if that's your thing. But as always on this podcast and elsewhere, I have a bias toward behavioral things that you can titrate and control, like exposure to light, exercise, temperature, et cetera, that have much bigger margins for safety and certainly, don't have these other endocrine effects that we've been thinking about and talking about. So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon in order to fall asleep, or in the evening, be my guest. That's up to you. Again, you're responsible for your health, not me. But for many people, melatonin is not going to be the best solution. The best solution is going to be to use light, and temperature, and exercise on either side of the temperature minimum to shift your clock, both before your trip and when you land in your new location, and your clock starts to shift. OK. So now, my opinions about melatonin. Feel free to filter them through your own opinions and experiences with melatonin. And now, you also understand what your temperature minimum is and how it represents an important landmark, either side of which, you can use light temperature and exercise to shift your clock. Just to remind you a little bit about temperature, if you want to shift your clock, you can take a hot shower. And then that will have a cooling effect after the hot shower. And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath, if you have access to one, afterward, there's going to be a thermogenic effect of your body, increasing temperature. So you can start to play these games with timing and hot and cold, with meals, whether or not you eat or you don't eat, and with light exposure, whether or not you view light or you don't view light. So now, you can start to see why understanding the core mechanics of a system can really give you the most flexibility. And that really underscores the most important thing is that when you understand mechanism, it's not about being neurotically attached to a specific protocol, it's the opposite. It can give you great confidence and flexibility in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want. And when things get out of whack, you can tuck them right back into place. One thing that's common is that people need to do a quick trip. It's not always that you're going to go on vacation for two weeks or work someplace else for weeks on end. If your trip is 48 hours or less, stay on your home schedule. 72, that's when you start running into trouble. The transit time is also important, but I would say, if it's three days or less, stay on your home schedule as much as you can. So let's talk a little bit about a different form of jet lag that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles, and that's shift work. Shift work is becoming increasingly common. Many of us are shift working, even though we don't have to. We're doing work in the middle of the night. We are working on our computers at odd hours, sleeping during the day. Here's the deal with shift work. If there's one rule of thumb for shift work, it's that if at all possible, you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days, including weekends. Now, that should immediately cue the non-shift workers to the importance of not getting too far off track on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker. So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea. The most important thing about shift work is to stay consistent with your schedule. If you're going to work a shift, where, let's say, you start at 4:00 PM and you end at 2:00 AM, excuse me, then there are some important questions that arise. For instance, should you see light during your shift? Well, this is a matter of personal choice, but ideally, you want to view as much light as possible and as safely possible when you need to be alert. So that would mean from 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM. And then you would want to sleep. So using light as a correlate of alertness and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness, what this means is, see as much light as you safely can during the phase of your day when you want to be awake. So let's say, you get home after this 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift. You maybe eat something. You go to sleep. And you wake up. And it's noon or 1:00 PM. Should you get light in your eyes? You guessed it. You need to know your temperature minimum. You need to know whether or not your temperature is increasing or decreasing. And now, we can make this whole thing even simpler and just say, if your temperature is decreasing, avoid light. If your temperature is increasing, get light. It's that simple. I'm going to pause there. And then I want to talk about kids and the elderly. In other words, how do we control sleep, and circadian rhythms, and wakefulness in babies, adolescents, teens, and aged folks? All right. As I mentioned earlier, melatonin is not cyclic. It's not cycling in babies. It's more phasic. It's being released at a constant level. And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are. And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high. As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume are going to go down. Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle. And now, all the parents are saying, tell me something I didn't know. Perhaps, the most important thing, if you're having to map to a baby's schedule in order to make sure that they're getting changings and nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times, if you can't sleep or you can't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system in a place where you're not going into heightened states of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping. Now, I realize that this could be translated to try and stay calm while you're sleep-deprived, which is very hard for people to do. But this is where the non-sleep deep rest protocols surface again, and can potentially be very beneficial for people to be able to recover, not necessarily, sleep, but for them to maintain a certain amount of autonomic regulation. Last night, I woke up. I went to bed about 10:30. I woke up at 3:00 in the morning. I knew I wasn't feeling rested. I did a NSDR protocol. I fell back asleep. I woke up at 6:30. You need to teach your brain and your nervous system how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep. And ideally, you do that without medication, unless there's a real need. You do that through these behavioral protocols. They work, because they involve using the body to shift the mind, not trying to just turn off your thoughts in the middle of the night. Similar circumstances can arise if you're taking care of a very sick loved one. You're up all night. Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols. I know it's harder to do than to say, but those protocols are there. They're free. There's research to support them. Try and get sleep whenever you can, but also try to get morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can. And if you can't get that, use artificial light. Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount of information at you. I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum and start working with that to access the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to access. I hope that you'll explore NSDR. You have now access to a lot of mechanism about sleep and wakefulness. I really believe that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms, and you start hearing some of the same themes again and again, you're going to start to develop an intuition and an understanding of how these systems work in you and your particular life circumstances. So know your temperature minimum. Understand, light in the early part of the day is valuable. Light when you want to be awake, provide it's not so bright, it's damaging. It's great for you, whether or not it comes from screens or sunlight, but sunlight is better. Avoid light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, or else, you're going to delay your clock, unless you're traveling, and that's what you want to do. OK? Use temperature. Increase temperature to shift your clock. Decrease temperature to delay your clock. Thanks so much for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. See you next time on the Huberman Lab podcast. And as always, thanks for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Why Venting Makes You & Others Feel Worse, Not Better
Published: 2024-12-02 20:01:50 UTC
Description:
Ethan Kross, Ph.D. is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan and a world expert in researching “chatter” (the voice in our heads) and emotion regulation.

Many people believe that verbally venting — or venting via text — makes us feel better. However, the data show that while venting strengthens social bonds, it also makes both the complainer and the listener more unhappy and amplifies negative emotions for both parties. Essentially, venting is counterproductive if your goal is to feel better.

This is interesting, considering that nearly all of us are prone to venting to some degree.

Note: The data on journaling (covered in this and a previous Huberman Lab episode) strongly suggest that processing bad experiences doesn’t do much to relieve the associated negative emotions. There’s something intriguing about the differences between journaling to oneself and complaining or venting to others.

Transcript Language: English
A lot of people think that the key to feeling better is to vent your emotions. There's research on this. Venting is good for strengthening bonds between people. It's good to know that, you know, we're buddies now. I could call you up if I'm struggling. You're going to listen to me and empathize with me. That's great for our relationship, but if all you do is just validate what I'm going through and you don't take the next step to additionally help me look at that bigger picture and problem solve, I leave the conversation feeling really good about my relationship with you, but the problem is still there. So just venting ends up leading to what we call co-rumination, which can be pretty harmful. The people on my Chatter Advisory Board, they know to first validate, empathize with me, learn about what I'm going through. They've got my back. They communicate that powerfully, but then once they do that, they start working with me to broaden the perspective, to try to think through that problem, which I'm having difficulty doing sometimes when the chatter is really, really loud and you know, typically when I get to that stage, I'm in pretty good shape.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Morgan howel Morgan howel is a partner at the collaborative fund and an expert in private wealth generation and management he is also the author of The spectacularly bestselling book the psychology of money and today we talk about the psychology of money we talk about how money can change your psychology we talk about how most people tend to lie at the extremes of either saving too much money or spending too much money and we talk about how most people get it completely wrong when it comes to framing in our minds what money is what it's real value is in its ability to generate happiness within us and no I am not going to tell you and Morgan is not going to tell you that Beyond a certain dollar amount you don't increase your happiness because as we all know money cannot buy happiness but it can buffer stress we acknowledge that from the outset and then Morgan goes on to explain that really what we're seeking when we talk about seeking wealth or money is freedom freedom is really about independence and that if we are constantly in pursuit of wealth well then we are not truly free or independent so today's discussion is as much about being happy being free feeling independent feeling free of stress as it is about this thing that we call money so in other words Morgan explains not just how to generate and manage money monetary wealth he explains that but he also explains how to organize your life in and around this thing that we call career the pursuit of wealth and happiness and I can think of few topics as important as today's topic I read Morgan's book the psychology of money and I loved it I also love today's discussion because I'm certain that after it's done you will realize that you've probably been thinking about wealth and money incorrectly in a number of ways and you've probably been pursuing it incorrectly in a number of ways but by asking yourself certain probe questions that Morgan raises today and answering those questions you can arrive in a place where your relationship to money and your pursuit of it really clearly matches your particular goals before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is wealthfront I've been using wealthfront for nearly a decade as my high yield cash account and I absolutely love it personally I'm sometimes hesitant to invest money given the risks involved so I often prefer to keep it in my wealthfront cash account where I'm able to earn 4.25% annual percentage yield on my deposits and you can as well with wealthfront you can earn 4.25% apy on your cash through partner Banks until you're ready to either spend that money or invest it with wealth run you also get free same day withdrawals to eligible accounts every day day even on weekends and holidays the 4.25% apy is not a promotional rate there's no limit to what you can deposit and earn and you can even get protection of up to $8 million through FDIC Insurance provided through wealth fronts partner banks for same day withdrawals just start your withdrawal as late

book coming out next year about the art of spending money is that right that's right you got it today I want to talk about how to think about money what is it how do we frame it within our historical context meaning our personal historical context because I think we all and each think about money a little bit differently and then talk about what is the best use or in some cases uh not use of of money this is a topic that you know could go in any number of different directions but my goal here is that people will get a better understanding of what money is why they work for it and really how to make it a true asset to their lives as opposed to something that um is forever Out Of Reach in terms of amount or what they expect it to bring them great looking forward to it great so um your book starts off with this notion that U people are not crazy it's in fact the the title of the chapter does that mean that people are rational about money oh I think it's very different what I meant by no one is crazy is that it is so easy for people to look around at society and how people are spending their money and saving their money and investing their money and say why why the hell would anybody do that why would you waste your money on this why would you hoard your money like that and actually think if you peel back the onion layer of what's going on in those people's lives no one is really that crazy with how they spend their money or save their money it makes sense to them in that moment my brother-in-law is a social worker he works with very disadvantaged kids kids who are abused at home who don't have homes and a lot of those kids not surprisingly uh do very poorly at school they misbehave they get in fights they don't go to school and it is so common for those kids that the teacher will look at those kids and say why why are you acting like this why don't you do the right thing it's so obvious and he says there's a there's a phrase in social work all Behavior makes sense with enough information that if you look at what those kids are dealing with in life it would all make sense to you why they are misbehaving at school and I think that's a powerful idea for a lot of things in life that all Behavior makes sense with enough information and you can really apply it to money too that you could easily tie how I spend my money today and save my money today based off of the experience that I've had in life how I was raised where I was raised how old I am the generation I was born into all things that are outside of my control and it is very common to look at people who are spending a ton of money well that there's a story behind that they're spending a ton of money because they want some you know for a lot of them they want some sort of attention they're trying to get people's attention maybe some times they're trying to cover up a hole maybe they actually are really enjoying it people who are hoarding a lot of money there's a story there too they EXP erence something that's causing them to do that and I think this is really important for two reasons one it forces you to realize that there is not one right way to manage money to save it to spend it you got to figure out what works for you and what works for me might not work for you there's not one answer and it's not like math like in math 2 plus 2 equals 4 for everybody and in money it's like you got to figure it out for yourself it's almost like your taste in food or your taste in music like just find out what you like and do that the other thing is I think you become less cynical about other people's decisions and you don't spend all your day saying look at that idiot spending their money in a stupid way no it's just you got to figure it out for yourself and I think you become happier when you're a little less cynical about how other people are doing it for most people including myself the whole notion of money and safety are very closely linked you know do we have enough resources to take care of ourselves plus a bit extra one hopes I guess I would include in taking care of oneself um buffering one's anxiety about not having enough money that's part of the psychological care um and also taking care of others that we might be responsible for or simply want to take care of that's very closely linked to Notions of how much and what type of education to get right I mean I think everyone presumably at some point um goes through the uh mental gymnastics of is it worth it to get an advanced degree What majors should I focus on is that are there any jobs there when I went to school to be a neuroscientist a cardiologist a friend of our family said why would you go into Neuroscience there no jobs in that um there were plenty of jobs in neuroscience and still are I wouldn't say that most of them are high-paying jobs so you know we know that higher education doesn't always scale with higher income as we grow up and move into the world you know we're thinking about how to integrate all these different things what we want to do because it's interesting versus what will make us money in your experience and observation and in writing your book is there some sort of path to to cut through these different considerations I mean when we talk about money and wealth you know what should we really take into consideration is there some sort of checklist I mean it becomes a pretty vast space um I believe that you get the best work out of yourself uh in terms of going after things you're really interested in yeah but you know there may not be money in um things that are highly interesting to somebody I asked Daniel conoman a very similar question about 10 years ago conoman is a a world-renowned psychologist won the Nobel prize in economics passed away a year or two ago and uh he said the trait that you need to do well with money over time no matter who you are is a well-calibrated sense of your future regret what are you going to end up regretting in the past I think at the highest level that's how you should base all of your financial decisions is will I regret spending this or not spending this will I regret making or not making this investment now much easier said than done I think most people do not fully understand their own sense of regret what they're likely to look back and say I wish I had not have done this the other thing is that it changes over the course of your life I'll give you a perfect example I'm a big saver have been for my entire adult life um what if if heaven forbid if I were on my deathbed tomorrow would I regret the vacations I didn't take the cars I didn't buy the answer right now is absolutely not I would feel so good knowing that my wife and kids are going to be okay so I would take so much pleasure in knowing that I did not spend that I saved it for their protection will I still feel that way if I'm 80 years old then maybe I will look back and say I should have lived a little bit more I should have given my money away while I could have seen it being given away so it changes throughout the course of your life but I think if you're always thinking through the lens of what am I going to regret it's never about uh YOLO or about like oh you know you know safe you know safe today so so you can have it for tomorrow it's I think that's too too simple to think about it you have to know what you're going to regret in the the future and look back and back to everyone's different what I will regret might be very different from what you will regret very interesting story from Jeff Bezos he talked about when he started Amazon back in I think it was 1994 the reason he started it and he knew that there was very little chance it was going to work uh when he first started it but he said if I do not try this I will regret it and if I try it and it fails I won't regret that that's an amazing story that talks about his entrepreneurial Spirit the other thing when I first heard that story is bless him thinking that I do not have that personality if I devoted my entire life and my family's money and my parents money to a startup and it failed I I I might regret that I admire and I'm grateful for the people who do not have that Vision as he does made the world better but everyone's sense of regrets going to be a little bit different and sometimes this sense of what one is likely to regret if we have access to it at all because it sounds like we're not very good at anticipating this as Conan pointed out um uh most people lack a well- calibrated sense of future regret that's going to change over time so it's Dynamic and here we're talking about investing in twoyear or fouryear degrees we're talking about investing in a one's time that is in uh a particular profession and I think we come up with all these explanations uh post Hawk about well you know I went to that uh company I went into that line of work I spent 10 years there or the the startup failed but I learned a valuable lesson that then you know uh really supported me in a future Endeavor and so we rationalize our poor choices from the past in ways that allow us to you know connect the dots to sort of steal from the the famous Steve Steve Jobs speech um and yet all of this really says that we are very poor at placing our current experience and our past experience into any kind of future projection of ourselves you talk a little bit about this in your book and this really um you know sunk in for me in a major way that we don't really know or anticipate how we are likely to change as we get older right so there's a thing in Psychology call the end of History illusion which means that you are very aware of how much you've changed in the last 20 years you are maybe smarter wiser you have your beliefs about things in life have evolved uh and that's true for most people but most people if you if you actually dig into it they think if you say who we who will you be in 20 years from now they think they'll roughly be the same person they are today there's always this belief that I've have grown so much in the past but I'm done growing because you it's hard to project how you're going to be different in the future a lot of that is if I tell myself 20 years from now I'll have very different beliefs about politics whatever it might be what I'm effectively admitting is what I believe today is wrong and you don't want to believe that everyone wants to wake up and look in the mirror and say what I believe today is the right thing it's just like a self-justification of your own beliefs to makes it easier to go about the day what I believe right now is the right thing and maybe you have a little bit of Doubt around the edges but most of it is what I believe is true so you don't want to believe that you're going to adjust and adapt those beliefs over time so it becomes difficult to take a truly long-term View and make a decision today that is going to be something that you're not going to regret in the future as I've always framed this I think the only antidote to this of trying to get around this problem is avoiding the extreme ends of financial planning and a lot of people are on the extreme ends like on one end you have the fire movement these people who save 90% of their income and they want to retire at 28 kind of that kind of thing and on the other hand you have like the YOLO crypto traders who are like doesn't matter like just throw it all down and let's see what happens those extreme ends are you are most likely to regret at some point in the future and the crypto look I think a lot of those people are young and they have time to make up for their mistakes I did a lot of really dumb things with my money in my teens and 20s but I think a lot of them um that's where they are most likely to look back you know it's it's it's one thing to lose a lot of money in your 20s and say ah it doesn't really matter but then when you're 48 and trying to put your kids through college that's when you're going to look back and be like I wish I wouldn't I wish I hadn't done something like that so those extreme ends are like have the highest odds of future regret in order to as I described it before carve a path through this for people I'm wondering if people generally fall into either one or the other category of as you described with Bezos you know not wanting to regret not having done something okay so I think of that in sort of pseudo neurobiological terms as being drawn toward the possible uh dopaminergic or other rewards of having succeeded really that's what he's envisioning presumably is um the pain of having not having given himself the opportunity to succeed yeah okay that's uh one way to put it and then the other path would be just avoiding the pain of loss and there are a lot of studies I think conmen did some of them in fact that people work a lot harder to avoid the pain of loss than to gain something but in thinking about the people I know of across various wealth scales and different ages it seems that some people are just more motivated to try new things because they like doing new things they like the sense of reward that can come from doing those things and so it really is painful for them to stay in the same place financially or otherwise other people they like the sure thing they like reliability and you can see this in a lot of domains of their life I mean I don't want to extrapolate this to all aspects of their life but you know some people like dogs that you know entire breed would uh you know is known for rarely ever having bitten somebody other people like to raise K coros and while I'm sure there's some really nice loving can coros out there they occasionally bite it when they bite it serious so you know are we really talking about a propensity for risk versus safety and do you think that people fall into more or less two camps on that I think it's it's it's true that some people would go nuts if they took the safe path and even if they're doing it in the name of like I don't want to regret this but they need some sort of variability in their life they need to go out and do things the other element is we don't know the paths that we didn't take and I'll give you a personal example of this uh 20 years ago I was enrolled in Pepperdine uh but I didn't go I was enrolled and just at the last second I transferred so I never actually attended but I was all enrolled and of course I think what would my life have been if I had gone there because the school that I transferred to I met my wife started my career there and it's easy for me to say God I'm so glad I did not go there cuz my life would not what it is today but the truth is maybe it would have been fine may it would have been better you you you you never know the paths that you didn't take where they're going to end up so back to con's point a well calibrated sense of your future regret but nobody knows the past that they didn't take and where those would go so it it just makes it very difficult to have any idea of of which which path you should be on uh in that end so I I think just avoiding those two camps of the extreme ends of it but again as I said earlier I think that is actually more than half of people are on some sort of extreme end of spending way more than they can or saving way more than they need to there's there's a fat tail distribution in how people manage their money and so that's quite a few people and I think that's why I think it's one of the reasons why we live in a society that is richer than it's ever been by far not just at the top but at the median level the average family is richer than they've ever been but because we manage it in such Extreme Ways is it making people happier are we happier today than we were 40 years ago or 100 years ago that there's not a ton of evidence for because managing it in way that's actually going to make you happier and reduce your regret and live a more meaningful life is much harder than earning it and accumulating it over time when I was growing up you would see a mixture of newer cars including some very nice cars as well as a lot of older kind of beaten up cars driving around nowadays of course this varies by area it's actually rare to see really old beat up cars you see some really nice old cars that have been restored but that's a different thing all together and I assume this is because of credit that people can now buy things on credit how has the ability to purchase things on credit change the way that we think about money generally I know people who have tremendous credit card debt and I think are now at the point where they figure that they're never going to pay it off yeah they're just going to probably not live long enough to pay it off and they're sort of comfortable with that which is kind of scary to see and some of them aren't even particularly Big Spenders they just acred this debt early enough and they seem to get out from the trap of that I know other people who you know like myself pay off my credit card bill every month I'm like you know I hate the whatever it is 18 plus% interest even if I'm one day late I'm like you know and and at the same time I'm not somebody who likes to purchase many things I'm not a things guy I you know I own you know one or two watches one truck like I'm just not a things guy but I certainly have my own psychological relationship with money that after talking to you today I'm sure I'm going to realize is not optimized either right so it's easy to point fingers at people in these different groups but going back to this issue of credit yeah how has the ability to own and use things that we don't really truly own basically to exceed our income level in terms of the number and type of luxuries that we can enjoy change the way that people think about money and use money because today's discussion in your book we're talking about money as if it's something that we have but credit basically is living outside your means by definition I think the knee-jerk response would be oh it helps you pull your consumption forward so you can have more toys that you would not have had in a different era and actually think for a lot of people it's the opposite that there are a lot of people that have holes in their life challenges in their life and a very easy answer if you if you're not happy with your life and you have a hole you're trying to fill is well if I had more money this problem would go away and in previous generations previous decades you could not just go out and have a ton of more money you you earned your money from your paycheck that was what you had today it makes it easier to try to fill that hole in your life with money and so you can keep on getting more and more and more and for a lot of people they will wake up and say oh if only I had that car my life would be better and they go buy that car and they still feel the same so it's like ah you know what if I had that car and that watch then I'd feel better they get the watch they feel the same ah you know what's missing the house I got to go get that fancy house it's a continuous spiral and since you can Finance all of that it makes it easier and easier to go on that spiral Will Smith SM made this incredible realization I loved from his biography he said when he was uh poor and depressed he had hope cuz he could tell himself one day I'm going to have money and all these problems will go away and then when he was rich and depressed he was still depressed and he lost all of his hope because he he had more money than he could ever spend so he could not tell himself if only I had more money these problems would go away and so for a lot of people the availability of credit is giving them I think a false sense of hope that's keeping them on this on this hamster wheel of if only I had this bigger house this nicer car all these problems that I wake up with every morning would go away and it keeps you on that path which I think if you actually don't have access to that much money you're more likely to wake up and say what is this hole I need to fix it in a different way it's Health it's relationships its purpose whatever it might be rather than trying to put a bandid of credit over it so interesting I sometimes think about the phrase money can't buy happiness and my immediate impulse is to respond with well somebody with a lot of money probably said that not because I think money can buy happiness but money can buffer stress I have friends who've had children recently who have night nurses they're looking a lot more rested than the ones that don't because they can't afford them uh and on and on if you have a medical issue right I mean there's this whole world within hospitals that uh we won't talk about in this episode but there's this whole world about wealth and how one is actually even treated as a person in a hospital mhm there's a lot of knowledge behind the scenes about people's income level when they come into a hospital people are going to go wide-eyed when they hear this they'll get shuttled to different rooms different conditions that allow them to sleep better recover Better Health outcomes depend on this I mean and on and on so money can't buy happiness but it certainly can buffer stress and it can drive outcomes so how should we frame that especially if we are on the um or in the pursuit of acquiring More Money More wealth because lot of people are money absolutely can buy happiness it's often though an indirect path and what I mean by that is will a big fancy house make you happier and the answer is probably yes but the reason it might is because it'll make it more it'll make it easier to host friends and family and that's what's actually making you happy it's those those extra connections with those people does going on a nice vacation make you happy an expensive vacation yes because you're going to form memories with your kids with your spouse with your friends while you're there that's what's making you happy so you can't say that money doesn't make people it does it obviously does the other thing that's important is what really makes people happy in their core is some sense of purpose there's a great quote from the movie Boiler Room where he says people who say money doesn't buy happiness don't have any I think that I think there's a lot of Truth to that that people who become richer say of course I was happier now than I was when I was poor of course I would never want to go back there but often what's happening is the reason that you are happier when you were rich is because the reason you got rich is because you found some sort of purpose you built a business you were successful in your career career and that gave you a good sense of purpose and identity and where you see the opposite of that are lottery winners who become rich but not because they made a good investment not because they built a business not because they're successful and their peers like them and whatnot they just got lucky and those are the people so many studies that winning the lottery will not make you happy it might for a very short period of time but over time it doesn't because you didn't get any added purpose you can't wake up in the morning and say I built this business I did it I you know I'm so successful I got my PhD I did there's none of that you just got lucky and so that's not going to bring you much happiness so money does make you happier I think it can for everybody if you learn how to spend it in your personality and whatnot uh spending a lot of it spending a ton of money can make you happier I think I think there's almost no limit to it but it's different for everybody and it's often a roundabout way I think a lot about this when if I go on an expensive vacation with my kids let's say that's a that's a 10 that's a 10 out of 10 in terms of just happiness memories and whatnot but actually what was making me happy was spending uninterrupted time with my kids so staying home and playing Legos on the living room floor with them that might be like an eight and a half because because that's what's making me happy you just have to figure out like the actual purpose I think a good formula for a pretty good life at the simplest level is Independence plus purpose you need to have a purpose that is bigger than yourself that you are chasing family religion work whatever it might be different for everybody you need and you need to have the independence to make sure you can do it on your own terms rather than chasing somebody else's goal that's at the highest level of psychological well-being Independence and purpose and money is not one of those things but you can easily see how money can help those things money brings you Independence it can allow you to find your purpose in a bigger way you're not chasing you're not you're not at your boss's whim you can do whatever you want you're independent so using money as a tool can make you happier spending money can make you happier but it's not the thing that is making you happier it's just a tool to do other things and acquire other things that are actually making you happy I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I'm excited to share that Roa and I have teamed up to create a new style of red lens glasses these red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening after the sun goes down they filter out short wavelength light that comes from screens and from LED lights sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used as overhead and frankly lamp lighting nowadays I want to emphasize Roa red lenss glasses are not traditional blue blockers they're not designed to be worn during the day and to filter out blue light from screen light they're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths that suppress melatonin secretion at night and that can alter your sleep so by wearing Roa red lens glasses they help you calm down and they improve your transition to sleep most nights I stay up until about 10: p.m. or even midnight night and I wake up between 5: and 7:00 a.m. depending on when I went to sleep now I put my Roa red lens glasses on as soon as it gets dark outside and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep which makes sense based on everything we know about how filtering out shortwave lengths of light can allow your brain to function correctly Roa red lens glasses also look cool frankly you can wear them out to dinner or to concerts or out with friends so it turns out it is indeed possible to support your biology to be scientific about it and to remain social after all if you'd like to try try Roa go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout I love the story about spending time with your kids on vacation as unstructured time as well as spending unstructured time with them playing Legos at home my graduate adviser sadly passed away very young of cancer she was 50 and I knew her kids really when they were in the womb CU she was pregnant with the first one and I attended the memorial service there and um it was an incredible thing because people gave up gave their speeches and um and her kids got up and by then they were I think you know about 8 and 11 or so and I'm sure they had a great many thoughts and feelings that they didn't share but the one thing that really stood out is they appreciated how much unstructured time their mom had spent with them it wasn't this like big event or something it was all the unstructured time that she had spent with them and that was very inherent to the kind of person she was and so that really stuck with me and God willing you live a very long time but I think for anyone listening to this and because of the statement that conman made where that we are not well calibrated to sense a future regret you know that unstructured time is perhaps one of the most valuable things that we can give our relationships both the people we engage in them with and ourselves and it's I don't think it's I don't think it's disgusted enough there's a a gerontologist named Carl pmer who wrote a book great book called 30 lessons for living and what he did is he interviewed about a 100 centenarians and he just said tell me about your life what what you know what what advice do you have for the rest of us and there's a section of his book about money and he says of the of the thousand people there a thousand people he interviewed of the 10,000 centenarians he interviewed not a single one of them looking back at their lives said I wish I earned more money not one but virtually every one of them said I wish I spent more time with my kids I wish I was nicer to people I wish I spent more time with my friends my family that was Universal but earn more money was not in there whatsoever that stuck with me mhm and as you point out however earning money allows for the opportunity to spend time with kids and loved ones of all kinds it can but I think there are a lot of people for whom it's the opposite if you are a partner at a law firm you're earning a ton of money congratulations great you proba have a big house and a nice car you're also probably working 100 hours a week and the things that might fill your soul it's different for everybody this is not Universal but what might actually make you happy spending time with your friends your family exercising sleeping late uh is not available to you so that's why it's Independence plus purpose and I think there are a lot of people who make millions of dollars per year and have no Independence whatsoever they're completely tied to their boss's whims to their work to their employer they might love it I'm not saying you shouldn't do that but they have no Independence at all I think there are billionaires who have no Independence because they are so tied to doing things whether they like it or not and that's I think a lot of people go crazy in that situation because they're like I'm making $5 million a year but it's not making me any happier it's like yeah what what would make you happier is independence and you are pushing ping yourself away from that you were probably more independent when you were 15 and had no money than you are at 40 making millions of dollars a year so then in an Ideal World which of course doesn't exist one would find a vocation or a Pursuit that they found really meaningful would work really really hard would make enough money to then I guess retire and spend unstructured time with the people you love and then simply stop working in this model that clearly is an artificial model that I'm creating here um because it seems like after a certain point provided you earned that money through an effort that you felt was meaningful um presumably with people you enjoy or even if it wasn't you found it meaningful you make that money then it seems that it's all about human interactions at that point yeah and what's what's true is that that that scenario that that you know dream scenario might be true for 1% of the people that they can earn enough money to retire young and then pursue whatever they want there's an entrepreneur named Felix Dennis who wrote A book many years ago called how to get rich and there's a quote in that book he says he was at the time maybe in his 70s and worth about a billion dollars something like that and he said if I knew what I knew now and I could do life over again I would make as much money as I could retire at age 35 and plant trees and write poetry and he's like looking back that's that's what I should have done is do but let's leave aside that of course not everybody can do that what he do he kept working he kept working even though he didn't need more money absolutely this is interesting because people who do achieve a high degree of wealth at a young age seem to keep going and we could make all sorts of assumptions about why it is that they do that expectations that they uh from others um that their ego uh literally their sense of self in some way or perhaps entirely is um is tied to the sense that they're still in Pursuit um that it's somehow a failure to opt out at that point yeah um I mean we can speculate all day but um what this guy Felix said really Rings true it seems like once people reach number and it for everyone it's going to be different it's not going to be a billion dollars for everybody once they have enough resources for themselves and the people they need to take care of maybe a bit more as a buffer it makes no sense to continue on that path well I think there are a lot of people I think you're one of them and I'm one of them who enjoy what they do and if you and I got to a point where we're completely financially independent all the money we'll need for the rest of our life I would still be a writer you would still do your research because we enjoy it absolutely it's not just right and I think if actually if you are the kind of person who says once I hit my number I'm done you probably don't love your work at all almost by definition you don't uh I think what's dangerous though is when the money itself is part of your identity I like being a writer I like the process of writing but if I were to say I have to keep writing books because I need to make more money I just I have to have a higher net worth particularly if I'm past the point of taking care of my family then at that point I think money is actually like a liability it's a financial asset and a psychological liability it's taking control over what you're doing in life if you're saying I have to have more of it I mean if there's anything in life where you're like I I have to have more and even when I get more my satiation point goes higher and higher what is that it's an addiction and that's it's controlling you at that point so there are a lot of people for whom money is a financial asset and a psychological liability and I think that's actually true for some of the richest people in society that the more like it it grows exponentially over time the Richer you become the more addicted to having more grows on you in the backdrop of everything we've talked about thus far is the biology of dope reward um dopamine of course being a molecule that people associate with reward but it's really about the pursuit of reward it's about more it's about and it's it's no coincidence that dopamine is involved in generating movement in the body this is why people with Parkinson's who are depleted in dopamine can't generate movement and it's also involved in generating cognitive movement and pursuit paying attention to things there is this idea uh that I've been pushing for a few years now that kind of throws its arms around a big literature on dopamine that says that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure but your definition is actually much better I realize addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure and or safety or a sense of safety yeah right because here we're not talking about making more money to enjoy things more we're talking about making more money to avoid the sense that pain is coming or that we are vulnerable and for a lot of people that pain is a social pain that they not going to climb high enough on the social ladder that their peers are earning more than them that their neighbors have a bigger house whatever it might be that's the pain that they're trying to avoid and that is a game that cannot be won because gratefully thankfully there are a lot of very wealthy people in this world and no matter how much money you're making there's already some there's always somebody out there who's earning more living better and has bigger house and a nicer car that's always the case so if you are on that path of I need to earn more to climb that ladder so I can have more than the next guy mean that's that's a game that you cannot win and I I think that game of comparison too also grows the wealthier you are that you are the billionaires are more likely to compare themselves to other billionaires than the minimum wage worker is to compare themselves to somebody making $10 an hour or whatever it's you are more likely to compare your lifestyle the Richer you become and since that comparison to other people is what gives you a feeling of inadequacy there's this irony it's hard to wrap your head around it and come to terms with it but some of the most money insecure people you'll ever meet are the richest people you'll ever meet people who live in a 15,000 ft Mansion yeah but he's got a 17,000 ft Mansion things that Ordinary People would never consider that just consumes their life and again that's the point where money is like the psychological debt it's psychological liability it's controlling their it it becomes an integral part of their identity they wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and they see uh a person who makes money that's their identity who are you I'm a person who makes money and that's when like your process of chasing it just becomes like a detriment to your happiness over time you're not using it as a tool to live a better life you're using it as a yard stick to measure yourself against others by I fundamentally believe that all forms of addiction all forms of addiction are fundamentally a fear of death their way of shrinking our uh aperture on time perception so that we're in pursuit of something and for people that can place their addiction within work it has this feedback of being quote unquote functional as opposed to dysfunctional this is also true for people that are continually uh seeking Awards within their profession I mean there these professions Academia included but other professions where people are constantly pinning Awards on one another and it gives this illusion of progress when in fact there's a whole world of things happening now these people often have quite healthy families and relationships so they're not mutually exclusive but you know I think I know a few billionaires not not many but I know some that are very happy they tend to be the people that are still working and in pursuit of new things Avid learners but perhaps by virtue of the work that I do which is focused on science but also Health you know the modern billionaires that I'm aware of seem to be very focused on not just making money but also trying to secure their place on the planet for a very long time not through Legacy although I think many of them like to provide for the next Generations in their family surely not So Much by putting their names on the sides of buildings anymore this used to be the way it was done but rather trying to secure their health status because the one thing that money can buy sort of is better health care right but money can't buy you more years of your life except by virtue of the things that you are willing to not do and do behaviorally yeah you still have to exercise you still have to get your sleep you have to avoid certain things um and so the modern billionaires often are talking about what they're doing for their health as opposed to their yacht their car Etc this has now become the kind of metric for comparison blood profiles become a sort of point of bragging for people it's pretty interesting uh especially given that you just look back about 50 or even 100 years and and further back and the more wealthy people were the less physical labor they were doing now they're doing more physical labor to try and live longer so what are your thoughts on the on the relationship between physical health and and money I mean obviously there's a there's a sweet spot there but um there's no pill that people can purchase to live longer right I I I view it in the negative sense of the people who work to get money so hard that it takes a physical toll on their body and that is so incredibly common and that's another form of debt that you can very easy you can easily measure your net worth and your income you could put a number on it very clean to measure how do you me it's much harder to measure your health and it's I think it's easier for people to say yes I'm Only Sleeping 5 hours a night and I'm I'm getting I'm I'm on my third divorce and I'm overweight but I'm making a lot of money this year because one is very easy to measure and the others are are much harder your happiness your health what not it's harder to measure that and I I I do think too that if you are very wealthy particularly the very very wealthy you get so accustomed towards I can snap my fingers and literally get anything a golf stream jet a mansion whatever I I I can get it right now but health is like this last elusive thing that's going to that by and large you cannot purchase and I think that drives a lot of people crazy and that's why if you can have anything in the world by snapping your fingers and getting it then you eventually move towards what's the thing that you don't have and that's immortality and I think that's there's a long history of that going back to the Robert Barons uh John de Rockefeller was obsessed with it Andrew Carnegie was obsessed with it if you can have everything material in the world you're still going to have desire and ordinary people can sit around and dream and say one day I'm going to have the Mansion we're not even a mansion one day I'm going to have a house of my own I'm going to have a car I'm going to send my kids to college everybody wants to dream so if all that is a given you have all the money you could ever spend you still want a dream so what do you dream about you dream about immortality and so I think that's that's been the case for a very long period of time what's interesting too is that there was a uh there was a historian who looked back at the British purage he got a lot of data on how long people lived in uh in various points of the UK economy and what he found was until about I think it was 1750 the richest members of the UK had among the shortest lives the poorest people were some of them who are living longest and he dug into it like how could this be the richest people die the fastest and what he found is the richest people were the only ones who could afford all the quack medicines and the Sham doctors who were just poisoning them they were poison ends to back in the day when we knew nothing about medicine so I think the idea of of I want a better life and I should be able to buy that like there's a long history of that backfiring on people as well yeah there's a lot of excitement right now about stem cells and treatments that currently are not available in the United States that are are available out of country and um I get asked about these a lot most of them don't have FDA approval yet um some of them probably never will have FDA approval uh we'll probably talk about stem cells another time do you think you see this though where the wealthiest people are spending money on treatments that you either know or not going to work or are a very questionable yeah work all the time and and that might backfire on you that might make you less healthy oh absolutely I mean I'll just point out I don't have anything against stem cell therapies I think they hold great potential um but there is a true story about a stem cell Clinic down in Florida prior to the FDA um you know bringing the gavel down on them of injecting stem cells into the eyes of wealthy people who could afford the treatment um these people had certain markers for uh macular degeneration and other things that can cause blindness and guess what happened to these people they all went blind right so that brought the gel down on stem cell therapy generally in this country a lot of people are getting infusions of stem cells and related things um out of country they're coming back and they're walking and talking so um and they're calling me and they're asking what what my thoughts are and I have a lot of thoughts I mean I think that the the basics of longevity are clear right I mean you want to avoid you know head trauma and environmental toxins those things are real and and um if you have certain mutations like braa mutations you know you need to be more careful about cancer and avoid smoking all the stuff right alcohol turns out to be pro pro cancerous and things of that sort but then it's you know it's physical activity it's nutrition it's social connection it's sleep it's sunlight it's you know it's all the things that I've talked about in this podcast and that other people talk about as well but yes very wealthy people are looking for that edge uh to live longer and it is true that when you start to layer in all the basics of dos and don'ts all all the behaviors and then you start to augment that with a few extra things you get the sense of more Vigor that sort of suggests they may live longer but you we we still don't know right we still don't know with the exception of exercise that we absolutely know can enrich mitochondrial density give people more energy and vigor Etc um you know most most of this is still a big question mark see I I could see uh a very wealthy person using their money if you are very sick and you have a rare cancer to throw the kitchen sink at it every excellent those those those million dollar therapies or what not absolutely I think it's a different animal if you are already pretty healthy to say I'm going to throw my money at trying to be become immortal or close to it whatever it might be that's that's that's a different thing uh I totally agree and and I think what we're talking about here is as you said it fairly quickly but I think I want to highlight it um because I think it's really important that even people who have billions of dollars still have a sense of of Yearning For for something that's missing yeah or that they don't have and in some cases that's the sustaining factor to their well-being you say it's also good to be in Pursuit right maybe that's with dopamine too right we we always want more it's it's the pursuit of more and if you're wealthy enough to have everything you still have a a part of your brain it's like yeah but I want more I want more I want more and if you've exhausted the physical part of the world that material part of the world and let's leave aside the billionaires even the average ordinary American family that owns a modest house owns a car that functions well owns nice clothes will send their kids to a state school by a lot of historical definitions they have everything they have everything you would ever need but you're always yearning for more it's always is this pursuit of well what else don't I have and I think nothing you what you want more than anything in life is what you want and cannot have that's what you're going to chase with all of your effort is a thing that you want and cannot have I think that that that's where health comes in for a lot of these people as long as you think that there's a possibility you could get it the uh the dopamine circuit loves you want what you feel is just out of your reach but might be possible to achieve I mean this is why people throw so much money away gambling but maybe with social media it makes it seem so that there are virtually anything is within your reach because it used to be before social media that your view of the world was mostly your neighbors and your co-workers and your siblings and now everybody's view of the world is a curated highlight real of the most extreme events in the world so if you are a 15-year-old scrolling through in Instagram then what is within your reach what looks within your reach is a Ferrari and a private jet and a mansion in a way that didn't exist when you and I were kids and I think it it makes the aspiration level that much harder and real examples of people who went from nothing to immensely popular or wealthy Etc I mean gosh I would say about once a month somebody walks right up to me and says just watch Someday I'm gonna have the top podcast in the world on blank and they they're trying to seed this thing that they've seen on social media which are examples of people you know kind of it used to be called rags to riches but you know they parallels in different universes but there's a famous musician I think his name is Ed Sheeran who there's still a video of him early on saying like he knew he was going to make it if you watch the Conor McGregor documentary it's amazing I think it's called notorious on Netflix even if people aren't into to MMA they should they should at least watch the first part he was videotaping himself very early on and he made this prediction that he was going to be a world champion and then he ends up being a world champion right um this is great anecdote that Kanye West used to practice his Grammy speech when he was walking to the train because he couldn't afford the car like when he was an absolute nobody he was practicing his Grammy acceptance speech of just like absolute ambition of where you're going yeah and I don't know if this anecdote is true but there's the the anote that I heard that you know Matt Damon and um uh Ben Affleck practicing their Academy Awards AC acceptance speech on the school in the schoolyard when they were kids and then they gave their speech and they were you know laughing about that I grew up skateboarding so the when I first got into it the the Tony Hawks and the Mike mcgills and Steve cavaleros these were the names at the time where like these these luminaries right the gap between us and Them was so huge by time I was a junior in high school my best friend at the time Paul zuanic sent in a videotape of himself to a company called planet Earth he got sponsored next thing you know we're in the shop watching him skateboard and within a year or two he had his own PR model yeah so you I think social media gives us not just the sense of what's out there but it gives us very Salient examples of people that went from completely unknown to extremely known just this last year there's the uh you know the so Haw Tu a girl you know it's interviewed outside a bar something like she now has a very popular podcast she has sponsors she's known literally became one of the most famous people in the country right and and has a financial stream now of of income to through her podcast and so this raises the the the sort of idea and people's minds or the the possibility however remote that if somebody puts a camera in front of you by virtue of one thing that you say you could suddenly be a inter internationally known person and potentially go from quote unquote rags to riches and if you look at the studies when you ask teenagers what is your uh preferred career what do you want to be when you grow up it used to be astronaut used to be doctor used to be entrepreneur now it's influencer by far is what people want to be it seems like the quickest path to fame and wealth and for a lot of people it is my sister-in-law is a kindergarten teacher she has a girl in her class who has over a million followers on YouTube as a kindergartener like that that that didn't exist when you and I were kids or it was so rare but now like like enough people know stories like that if there are a few of them enough people know stories to give you the sense of hope of like well if they could do it I could do it too well I'll tell everyone out there that um if you think that uh Fame is what you want um Fame restricts your freedom it does not increase your freedom there's a great quote from Nal where he says what you want to be is Rich and Anonymous that's the sweet spot that you want to be the opposite you are poor and famous uh and that's that's the hardest spot to be in but if you can be rich and anonymous because I think there's a a a really important concept with money that I call social debt which is when the money that you have influences it changes how other people think of you and even may maybe how you think about yourself and you can measure your asset it's not it's not actually debt like it's not like debt you repay the bank but is very much a debt in terms of it is an anchor on your happiness that you have to repay and fame is the ultimate social debt and for a lot of people their social debt of Fame is more than the money that they made from whatever made them famous to begin with and there's this anecdote from Tiger Woods where he said he loves scuba diving because when he's 100 feet under the ocean is the only time in the world where people aren't taking pictures of him and asking things of him and gawking at him like that's that sucks that's not that you have a lot of sympathy for somebody like that but it does suck like you can measure his net worth very quickly what's your net worth just show me the number how do you measure the liability of feeling like you have no privacy unless you are scuba diving that's a that's a hard thing and at various levels a lot of people have that even if you are uh earn a modest income and all a sudden your friends your family start saying hey I could you know I heard you got a raise I could I could use a little bit myself that's a social debt they want you to pay at dinner and whatnot and of course maybe you're happy to do that you're happy to share it but let's not pretend that there's not a little bit of social debt and liability that comes with every added amount of income that you have I mean so much of social media is just by definition in terms of the the number of followers being displayed Etc a number of likes and comments being displayed is is designed to set up these metrics of comparison yeah the smartest minds of the generation work at Facebook and Instagram and Twitter to figure out how to give you fomo how to generate a little bit more dopamine and they're very good at it I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetyl cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function one thing that um I wish somebody would do maybe it's been done is you mentioned earlier this uh not typical but I guess semic commmon thing of an article will come out and say you know that the five things that um people say on their deathbed or that they and they look back and they mentioned that they wish they'd spent less time at work they wish they' spent more time with their kids or more time in nature perhaps has anyone ever just asked people directly um what were the things that they are most proud of or the things that they really feel brought them tremendous meaning then and as they're passing away uh because it's it's it's related but it's kind of the inverse of the same question yeah Warren Buffett brought this up one time he said a good way to think about life is uh it's it's it's kind of grim but he said write what you want your obituary to say and then work backwards to live up to it and in that situation if you were to write like what do you want your obituary to say most people would say oh I I hope it says Morgan was a good father he was a good husband he helped his community he was admired by his co-workers that's what I wanted to say and for a lot of people it's different for everyone but it' be something like that and why Buffett said it was important is because nobody who's writing their preferred obituary would say uh would uh include the size of their house how many horsepower their their car had how nice their clothes were because everybody knows it doesn't matter and it's like uh forget who made this idea there's a thing between resume virtues and eulogy virtues yeah that was uh David Brook David Brooks said that thank you resumé virtues are you know how much money you make uh your degrees everything eulogy virtues is he was a great father he was a great friend he helped his community he was funny and I think most people really aspire to have eulogy virtues but they spend all their day chasing resume virtues resume virtues can be great I want a good education I want a good income but what you're really trying to chase is to use those things to gain more resume virtues at the end of the day so I think if you think about it through that lens a lot of these things become clear and that's why like I said going on a great vacation with my kids if that's a 10 what's really fun about that is is spending time with them when I'm detached from work I'm not checking my phone every seven seconds I'm just spending hours with my kids giving them my full attention that's what made me happy The View was great on the beach cool but that's what made me happy and I can do that at home can I and so that's that's the difference between like going to Maui is a resume virtue spending time with your kids is a eulogy virtue why is it do you think that even though we've proud all heard by now that you know compounding interest is great right you put in let's say a small or a moderate amount of money into even just a savings account that's acur couple percent you know varies year by year and with the economy of course or into the markets that over time if you quote unquote set it and forget it just kind of like put it there and walk away that you're likely to make x% over time and you can look at the plot you can you can look at that line upward and to the right it almost always is Jagged line drifting upward to the right and even just scroll over and see okay at age whatever I'm gonna have X number of dollars and that value is often very high relative to where one's current wealth is even if they're a student or they have very little put away we we all hear this we can see it you can run the models it's almost trivial and yet people don't do that even if they have the income to save is it that hard for us to project our emotional state and the sorts of things that we integrate in terms of life meaning and value into the future that most people just don't do that and why do you think that is I mean I'm not asking you to play neurobiologist here I mean I think we both agree that that uh time perception is is a complicated thing um but you would think that people would just sort of get it but we're not rational most people aren't rational in that way they don't save they don't invest and they don't compound interest and so they end up with a lot less money than they could have and a lot more regret yeah I think there's two ways to think about this one is uh my Michael batnick phrased it this way he said if I ask you what is 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 8 you figure that out in 5 seconds that's an easy one if I said what is 8 time 8 time 8 time 8 time 8 even if you're a math nerd that's it's it's too hard you can't figure it out we're not wired for exponential thinking we just can't do it and therefore a lot of even if you show you the numbers Hey invest a small amount retire with a million dollars I think it's so counterintuitive that most people see that like H okay that doesn't doesn't really seem right doesn't really pass the sniff test how big the numbers can get how quick quickly the numbers can get big the other thing is if you tell a young person hey you have 50 years in front of you to invest that's great times on your side when you're when you're 70 years old you're going to have $10 million 50 years from now might as well be 10,000 years from now you're talking about people who are who don't know what they're going to eat for dinner tonight and you're talking about like hey let's let's talk about the year 2077 like it's so far out of there even if that's the right way to think about it it's it's a tough way to think about it and time perception you mentioned is so difficult for people if I said you're G to get punched in the face in 10 seconds like that's a fear and you're like oh I don't but if I said someone's gonna punch you in the face 50 years from now you're like I'll deal with it when I get there it's so easy to put out of sight out of mind and so and the other thing is Warren Buffett talked about this a lot he said uh actually it was Charlie Monger who said this he said when teaching Finance to young people people either understand it instantly or never it's like some people are just wired to get it and some people aren't and that's always been the case M often said all the time he said the iron rule of math is only 1% of people can end in the top 1% and that's why for a lot of people yes you should save and invest for 50 years let's not pretend that that is easy or that everybody is psychologically able to do it some people are wired differently of course that's the case as they are with health and intelligence and lots of other things so I do think there's a thing for financial education of getting people to understand what is possible but I don't think we'll ever live in a world where everyone gets it and does it I I don't think that world has never existed and I think will never exist because it's not math it's not a spreadsheet it's behavior and and we now live in a world where we understand the dangers of smoking and highly processed foods and whatever it might be but even if we know it people still do it because it's behavioral it's not intelligence so showing people the numbers and getting them to do it is night and day do you know how they got people to stop smoking in particular young people it wasn't by scaring them about their health turns out the most effective campaign to get especially young people to stop smoking was to hijack the inherent rebellion of Youth and to display ads of wealthy older people in rooms full of smoke so became us as the youth rebelling against them the older generation that are trying to take our money it had nothing to do with health I love that and it absolutely worked yeah and uh I have friends that work on this sort of thing in the context of Public Health as it relates to all sorts of Public Health initiatives and the effective way to change human behavior as it relates to health is to incen Aesthetics to incentivize fear uh or to hijack fear of dying but even fear of dying is not sufficient uh as compared to um hijacking these uh cross generational uh let's just call them frictions um that exist so I found that to be interesting used a math example of 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 8 versus 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 and you said that the human brain is not capable of exponential thinking or most people's brains are not capable of exponential thinking I think um you either intentionally or inadvertently hit on something really important I don't know that the dopamine reward system which is the fundamental currency of pursuit and reward across all time scales it's kind of wild right one neuromodulator and there are other things involved that modulate that modulator but one neuromodulator is involved in reward Pursuit across all time scales whether we're playing a let's say we're both competitive enough to play a game of chess or Checkers dopamine is motivating the pursuit for the win or a four-year degree or an eight-year degree or why you would want maybe your kids to win a soccer game like now you're like a third personing dopamine right it's across all time scales all scenarios it's incredible and across many species so it makes me wonder and I'll have to ask some of my colleagues that uh work on these dopamine reward schedules uh for a living whether or not the dopamine reward system actually can do exponential math it might not be able to do exponential math it might be that the pursuit of water the pursuit of mates the pursuit of food the pursuit of shelter which is what these dopamine circuits evolved under the constraints of whether or not they even capable of doing exponential thinking or if it's like the marshmallow test which got misconstrued in many ways but it's like yeah would would you rather have one right now or two in the future it's I think for a lot of people it's it's just like there there are some people for whom like they're wired so differently for this so you hear stories about like the old the the old very wealthy people the old billionaires of when they were 20 years old they would not get a haircut because they knew that $3 haircut would compound into $100 by the time they're older they were just so Wired from birth to understand this and to have a very long perception of time to do it by definition that's the Rarity most people are not like that and I I don't know if they should be either I don't know if you should be the kind of person in your entire life who is always saving for a future and and never en what you have too like that could lead to a lot of regret as well and there are those people so let's parse the marshmallow test the marshmallow test I think initially done at Stanford um I think it was at Bing nursery school or something like that or maybe somewhere at Stanford if I'm wrong someone will correct me in the comments of course for those that don't know is you they brought these really cute kids into rooms and they put the marshmallow in front of them and they told them they could eat it now or they could wait and they could get two marshmallows later and then they videotaped them and the the videos are absolutely delightful of the kids you know distracting themselves or having the marshmallows talk or taking a little piece of the marshmallows I mean it reveals as much variation on human self-constraint behavior as you could possibly imagine and they're really interesting as you know I would like to know whether the children that were able to wait and therefore get two marshmallows were trying to resist the temptation or whether or not they were being pulled forward by the anticipation of two marshmallows my understanding and maybe this is this is not complete but my understanding at least part of it was neither of those two things the kids who did the best and resisted it were the ones who distracted themselves they weren't even thinking about the marshmallow they would sing a song they would start playing with their shoes they'd play with another kid and the ones who could not resist are the ones who just sat there staring at the one marshmallow that was tempting them that's too hard to resist almost everybody will resist that it was like the environment that they put themselves in but they weren't thinking into the future about how great it would be to have two marshmallows I don't think so I think they were they were so because their kids are so distracted they have the memory of a goldfish they they they wanted they wanted to just do something they'd sing a song they'd play with their shoes they play with their friends and then by Dent of doing that all of a sudden they had waited long enough to get the two marshmallows I think that was at least part of it and I think there's true for a lot of people too take about think about the stock market where uh so much temptation to always watch it and see what it's doing because we have CNBC and there's the ticker and the lights are green and red and whatnot for a lot of people it's impossible to watch that or even worse in Robin Hood you get a push notification on your phone that's too hard to resist but you know what you see very good investing Behavior where people do a really good job is when you invest automatically every paycheck into your 401k and you forgot your password because that environment is is against Temptation there's there's nothing to do you forgot your password but if you're just bombarding yourself with stimulus of what to do most people cannot resist that my way of dealing with social media I would say compulsion not addiction is I now um one could take an old phone um I actually got a phone specifically for social media so I have Instagram and X on that phone I don't even recall the number of that phone I airdrop things onto it if I want to post and I I do what uh Rogan calls post and ghost yeah so you post and then it goes into a box because otherwise I'm just absolutely Blown Away by how much time can be sucked away all of it um you tell yourself I'm going to just look at social media for a moment and then you're pulled down some rabbit hole it's just incredible the way they've designed these algorithms to to get you right and of course I like social I teach on social media this conversation will probably be you know fragments of it will be on social media but um I think that people don't realize how compulsion inducing the dopamine circuitry is yeah and once you start getting pulled down it you're you're a different organism altogether and uh you know it's not a coincidence that the people who have the largest social media accounts spend very little time on social media this if you spend too much you just it just get overwhelming well you're spending time doing things like commenting and liking and and there's a liability to some of that but there's a reward to it too an immediate reward what you're not doing is going and doing the thing that you bring to social media that brings you more followers and and Views yeah so I always think of social media as uh the last point in a funnel where I go do things in real life like research papers talk to people um learn and then organize that learning into a format that I think people can benefit from and then put it on social media but that's the the end point yeah and so if I stay too long there um then I'm not getting more material it's almost like if if I were a farmer um you know this is like you know once the crops ship you know I'm not going to stand there just like looking at the road as the as the truck goes by yeah you got to get back and plant more seeds and plow the field I mean I mean so I like to think about these things in these very basic terms because I feel that the dopamine circuitry has it hasn't evolved right right but we have new new technology that have hijacked it to some extent Jerry Seinfeld said one of the reason he quit his show in the 1990s was because what made it so good and so funny is that he and Larry David would go like sit in a deli and watch people order and make a joke that's where they got their content from was observing the world but they got so busy and so famous that they couldn't do that anymore and he knew that it was going to come at the detriment of the show that it wasn't like the ultimate reward of like how big was the season how many people watch the show how much money do we make what made them great was going out and living and doing their thing and once it came at the expense of that it it didn't work anymore well this raises a really key point for people uh including myself which is in an ideal world one can make a living that is sufficient for their needs doing something that you truly enjoy doing or I would say to be realistic where 75% of the activities are pleasurable yeah maybe 15% are kind of of neutral and then the remainder there's some punishing features there are punishing features in every profession yes Jeff said if you can enjoy half that's pretty good okay all right so I'm I'm a little more um stringent with my with my yeah more of an optimist than Bezos hey I don't but then again he's Bezos um yeah where I mean you want to be able to enjoy your work not all aspects of it are are going to be pleasurable but ideally that's the case because what we're talking about here is effort that precedes dopamine yeah and I'm a big believer that dopamine that is not preceded by effort is very dangerous it's not just things that are addictive but by way of example methamphetamine cocaine dramatically and quickly Spike dopamine levels with no effort put in with no effort put in and then of course we know from the beautiful work of my colleague anmy and others that then the the dopamine profile is that then the higher the peak and the faster the rise to Peak then the more drop below Baseline and the more time it takes to return to Baseline and typically what people do is when they're below Baseline in terms of their dopamine that's when they start hitting the Hammer with whatever Behavior or substance and all it does is drive that Baseline further and further and further down maybe that's a good analogy for the lottery winner who gets a lot of money a lot of dopamine in this example but didn't put anything into it you didn't build a business you didn't work at your career you just got lucky so it doesn't feel as good there's no effort put into to like base it against compare it against what you were talking about before which is time that's unstructured with your kids playing Legos it's almost it sounds effortless it's not like you're like oh I got to go play with my is Legos I'm sure that you're like yes like this is fun this is this is the good stuff as they say and so there are forms of reward it seems that are not preceded by effort although you had to raise those kids and your wife had to give birth to those kids and it's work but but in terms of what's happening in in that limited time frame it's just so seamless right it's just sheer pleasure and yet that kind of pleasure is enriching is this has me very perplexed as a biologist I I I still don't know the underlying mechanisms but clearly we have multiple paths to pleasure but I think we have only one path for motivation and that's dopamine but I think there are multiple forms of pleasure and I'm certain that dopamine that is high levels of dopamine that are not preceded by effort are not just bad they are downright dangerous I feel like so much of it too with parenting m is a slightly different topic but it's the things that you're not trying to have fun with that build the biggest memories and for me it's when I travel with my son he's nine so we go on a lot of trips now what's fun is not the event we're going to whether it's skiing or a football game that's not the best part of the trip the best part of the trip is flying with him renting a car with him going out to dinner with him that's where you get all the memories it's like it's a process of doing it that's going to you're really enjoying that's going to build all the memories not NE not necessarily the the final destination where you're going yeah I I just want to hover on that for a second because I can think of numerous examples in my life where the best parts of a relationship were like a drive home with someone where like you know I'm asleep for part of the time they're asleep for part of the time and you get back and like like you really you feel like you really did something there's something bonding about about traveling with people yeah even in the absence of external input like you're you're just uh what is that it must be something fundamental some fundamental circuit about about journeying with with other members of our species going through a challenge with someone going going through a journey of like we we did this together we went through it together I think there's so much of that if you go on go on a long hike with somebody at the top like you want to hug each other like we just did that together and it's not it's not even about being at the top it's like the journey you did with each other so cliche but I think it's true for a lot of things and what's that movie with Emil Hirsch where he um it's a true story uh about the guy that goes out into the Alaskan Wilderness and lives on that bus and um sadly he passes away there I just spoiled it for you um but he has I think it's called into the wild into the wild where he's um obsessed with this notion of bonding with nature but then in his journal a real Journal of a guy that really died out there um he gets to the realization that the the the fundamental uh pursuit in life is to experience things with other people other people absolutely yeah and this is why solitary confinement is such a a torture the extreme end of it brutal right brutal on the other end of the spectrum there's Freedom so let's talk about Freedom yeah it means different things to different people but certainly one does not want to be enslaved by anything including their own pursuit of work so they I think at least two forms of anti-freedom one would be the type that exists within our head we have to continue on this track because I'm afraid of failure or I'm in pursuit of something and we are actually enslaved in a way that we uh s create for ourselves in in the act of pursuit the other is the job where you know it's providing resources but we really don't need to be there and yet people don't hop off the train yeah you know they could they could escape the the dreaded boss or the dreaded circumstance you know I remember a time when all I wanted was a window at work that opened for fresh air that's all I wanted I like all these other things I just I just wanted a window that opened I even tried to find one of these like little saws to but then the maintenance people or or the the whatever the facilities people told me I'd get in trouble um we we yearn for Freedom we hate we hate enslavement right for all the obvious reasons in your observation what is the best way to frame this need for freedom and I I have to imagine that people listening are at various points along their their careers um what have you observed here in yourself and with other people you talk to wealthy not wealthy what is freedom how do how do we get real freedom I think there's there's this anecdote that I love which was from uh Franklin Roosevelt when he was a kid I think he was like five years old he complained to his mother one day he said my entire life is rules and schedules and I hate it so mom said okay Frankie tomorrow you can do whatever you want do the day is yours anything you want and his mom Sarah Roosevelt wrote in her diary that night he said that day that he could do anything he went back to his normal schedule he did everything on schedule like he was supposed to do but he was much happier because nobody was telling him to do it and I think that's what's true for a lot of people Freedom does not mean you do nothing it doesn't necessarily mean you retire it doesn't mean you quit working I want to be free and independent which means I want to wake up every morning and say I can do whatever the hell I want today even of most mornings what I want to do is work and be productive and put myself to use so I think a lot of people misconstrue Freedom as I'm going to I'm going to ride off into the sunset and do nothing now it's like no I think people have an inherent drive to want to be productive and social and do things but there's a big difference between your boss telling you to do it and doing it on your own terms when I was a a junior in college like a lot of young men I wanted to be an investment banker that's what it looked like power and Prestige so I got this Investment Banking internship and it was absolutely miserable uh they had this saying that I is so funny in hindsight they said if you don't come to work on Saturday don't bother coming back on Sunday like just the culture of it was work as work 100 hours a week just just go nuts with it and I hated I hated every single second and I had to leave but it wasn't because I was not into hard work I think I was absolutely willing to to work hard I just didn't want anyone to tell me to do it and so when I became um you know not necessarily financially independent but I could have a job it was it was more entrepreneurial it was like oh I will work very hard and sometimes I might work as hard as an investment banker I might work 80 hours a week but it's on my terms and I think everyone is way more willing to do that than they are to be told what to do I think that is an inherent human driver and if you can use your money for Independence to where you can wake up and say I have the financial flexibility to work where I want live where I want retire when I want take a different job move to a different department even if it's going to pay less that giving yourself Independence and autonomy I think for most people is what's going to drive that's that's that's the highest tool that you can use with money and what's important about that is where do you get independence with money it's the things you don't spend money on it's the car you didn't buy it's the house you didn't buy and most people will view that as like idle money you're saving up money it's just sitting in the bank doing nothing no no no it's giving you Independence and once you view is like every dollar that you don't spend is money that you are actually spending on Independence it's not Idol it's giving you a it's giving you marginal more Independence than you had the day before then I think that's that to me that's why I save money I'm not saving money because I'm a I'm a pessimist I think it's all going to come collapsing down I'm saving money because I want to be independent because that's what I think is going to give me the most fulfillment the most happiness and that's where the savings comes from wow I think this is a super important concept how should the person who is let's just say early midcareer who likes what they're doing but thinks that this is probably not the thing for them I hear about this all the time like it's this like yeah like it's it's good but it's a ton of work it's unclear how it's going to turn out but they feel like they're already on the conveyor belt yeah there's always this question of do you do you stay in Investment Banking another year to make a bunch of money and then you get out so that you then have the freedom to pursue something where you have more freedom um you know people are always playing this kind of mental math and I don't think there's a a clear answer unless of course you're lucky enough that like you fall in love with science I mean I did not become a neuroscientist to make money and Lord knows I didn't I mean I made some I made a living but I if people what I was making as a tenured 45-year-old professor at a one of the Premier universities in the world where the salaries are relatively high they would be shocked right just shocked at post tax income is quite Low by Bay Area standards right but did you feel like you had Independence you could teach what you want say what you want there was a level of Independence absolutely oh and I loved it and and um you know and I still teach there and you know it's one of these things where I wouldn't trade it for anything I also in terms of intellectual stimulation um in terms of being able to look to my left or look to my right and and realize that most of the people at Stanford students included are just phenomenal like their level of intellect their Drive their excitement for what they're doing me no one ends up there by accident right so that was and remains extremely exciting yeah um but I think a lot of people unless they they they find a profession that they really love or there's some feature of that profession that that keeps them you know looped in in a way that that feels satisfying yeah the people Etc most people are kind of thinking like all right how do I work to make a living and then you know like what what's the exit ramp people think a lot about exit ramps and sometimes it's a dollar amount but also it's the idea that maybe you know go work on their real love which might be like gardening they want to you hear about these these sort of hobby interests right I'll go I'll write poetry or I'll you know go you know Ceramics or something like that um the things that they truly enjoy doing H how how should people optimize along those musts versus want to versus sort of aspirational goals two things come to mind here one is like if if most people understand inherently the dangers of Communism or something if the government's telling you what to do when to do it what to say that's a bad thing that's going to erode Society but a lot of those people work at a at a job where their boss tells them what time to come in what to wear what to say how to act what not it's so they they they really understand it fundamentally at one level but they're actually doing some version now companies have to manage their employees what not it's it's not a a a a knock against that but I think what's really true for Independence and people when they if they eventually move on to writing poetry and playing in their Garden whatever it might be is that you eventually is that you leave on your own terms that whatever your exit from your career was was because you wanted to do it on your own terms so the thing in Psychology called the peak end rule where uh to simplify it minimalize it a lot of how you remember any Endeavor that you did in life a career a vacation whatever it is is how you felt to the very end and for a lot of people if you have a great career you enjoyed your career you helped people you made money your colleagues appreciated you but then you got fired or your boss came to you and said you're too old to keep doing this that's bad that's a that's you'll never recover from that and you compare that to the people who quit on their own terms they said look I'm proud of my career but that's enough I'm going to I'm going to take a step back and pass a baton to another generation those are the people who even if they didn't really enjoy their career that much will look back at it fondly because it gets back to freedom and autonomy and control do you leave on your own terms or are you forced out on somebody else's schedule and so I think Maxim wherever you go in life whatever you're doing even if you're not an entrepreneur maximizing for Independence and autonomy and doing it on your own terms on your own calendar is absolutely vital in anything you're doing I mean Mo most people are not necessarily particularly as they get older are not necessarily scared of death they're scared of a death not on their own terms that that's going to sneak up on them where they're not going to have a chance to say goodbye so I think that's a good analogy for a lot of these things we're we're we're we're not scared of the ultimate outcome we're scared of not being able to do it on our own terms I once heard Ray doio say something along the lines of you know the first third of your life has spent trying to um learn how to function in the world then there's a kind of middle third where you are acquiring resources to be able to take care of yourself and people close to you and then in the final third of your life you want to take your knowledge take what you've gleaned in terms of Financial and other types of wealth because of course there are other types of wealth and put back you know for subsequent Generations it a beautiful model if you think about it I heard it phrased as when you get older you either become an elder or elderly you get to choose which one do you want to be an elder and help other people or elderly you're just going to disintegrate over time you got to choose which one uh nowadays we have both the benefit and the problem of people living longer and maintaining Vigor longer and therefore working longer this is certainly true in Academia people don't like to retire yeah they really do not like to retire and I don't think it's just so they can make more money I think it's so they can stay intellectually active people get into science typically because they like learning uh or academics generally they have a campus office where they go to and you know it makes them feel socially connected so you can understand all the reasons why these people in their late 60s 70s and even 80s sometimes even 90s continue to continue to go to work it's rare for these older generations of people that stay in various professions to continue to um glean resources but it happens I mean I how old is Buffett um 993 maybe yeah he's still investing yeah oh yeah full time okay and I'm presumably he's going to use that money for what either philanthropy or generational wealth within his family is that the plan he's already given away I think about 100 billion okay and the plan is to give away the vast majority I think he announced recently that he was going to leave each of his kids a billion dollars for philanthropy not for their personal use but for philanthropy and the rest is all is all given away oh yeah the the children of the ultra Rich that inherit all their wealth uh I don't know what the numbers are are there I I know a great number of them squander it yes but I also know a few examples of some that really make good on that those in those uh incredible assets that they inherited and are you know very um thoughtful hardworking people it does happen there couple families I think of all the big Rober Baron families of 150 years ago the Rockefellers probably did it the best the Rockefellers still have a lot of wealth the Vanderbilts by far did it the worst they just squandered it in a couple generations and this is fairly well known now but it's pretty interesting the first Vanderbilt Heir who did not get a trust fund for whom all the money was was dried up the first person who didn't get any money was Anderson Cooper of CNN his mother Gloria Vanderbilt was the last Vanderbilt who got a big trust fund and Cooper I think not coincidentally is the most successful and probably the happiest Vanderbilt Heir in 150 years and he's talked about this he was like I was the first person in my family who had to make a name for himself the fact that his last name is not Vanderbilt it's Cooper and didn't get any money he was like I I had to go out and find my own way and find my own identity whereas all of his ancestors their identity was you're rich from birth that's your identity you don't need to go out and make a name for yourself you don't need to work hard you don't need to create anything all you need to do is sit here and spend your money and it made them miserable and Cooper was the first person look this is this is very anecdotal not saying this how it's going to work for everyone but the first person who had to make a name for himself and work for himself was the one who was the most successful and probably the happiest super important concept again uh in incredibly important I think because people often will think that they because they were born into families that didn't have a lot of money that somehow um they were given the short end of the stick and in some sense they were right I mean it's one thing to grow up in a in a world with assets and another world where you don't have assets um but we don't often hear about the the downside it's hard to have sympathy for a Vanderbilt Heir who inherited $400 million on their 18th birthday sympathy for that right right well the show succession right you know it's all about the the horrible uh interpersonal dynamics of people that have a lot of wealth because it's never enough and they they self-destruct essentially I think the situation is you don't have sympathy for them but you should also realize that if you were in their shoes you would probably self-destruct as well it's very difficult to do once in a while you see someone who is completely motivated irrespective of money you know Mark Zuckerberg was offered a billion dollars cash for Facebook when I think he was 22 and he said no I don't want it I'm going to keep going that's a ridiculously rare personality and I think you know most people if I inherited a billion dollars on my 18th birthday I probably would have no motivation but if musk did if Elon Musk did wouldn't slow them down whatsoever uh Jeff Bezos did Mark Zuckerberg did those are very rare people who have motivation that is so detached from money I wonder if it's the excesses of wealth that um destroy people or if it's the fact that the excesses take them away from the pursuit of what delivered the wealth in the first place for a lot of those people it's the pursuit of solving the problem that's that's doing it and I've I have a good friend Patrick oasi who phrased it this way I'm going to paraphrase him but he said if you had to describe the me the mindset of those very successful entrepreneurs it's not driven it's not motivated it's tortured that they wake up every morning tortured by the problems that they're not fixing and the the opportunities that they have not yet uh uh found and there's a famous Elon Musk interview I think it was on Lex Friedman where he was like you think you want to be me the richest man in the world but you don't and he was like it's a storm up here it's a mess up here I think that's true for a lot of people my friend David SRA is a great podcast founder love such a good guy one of the best guys in the world I've ever met but he say of of all the 350 Founders that he's profiled uh only one of them has he actually said I I would want that guy's life it was Ed Thorp but put that aside of the other 349 I think you read their biography and can say I'm so glad that they existed by most most of the time they did a lot of good in the world they created products that make us better off and never in a million years what I want his life it seems miserable because most of the time the the simple answer is their financial and Career Success came the reason they're so successful is because they devoted every waking second of their entire life to this one problem this one Endeavor and that came at the expense of their family life of their health of their mental health their physical health and if you get a full view of their it's easy to look at musk and say oh richest man in the world that would wouldn't that be fun yeah but it came because he's had this life a singular Devotion to well in his case two or three different companies um and I think if you take that full picture it's less glamorous than it would than it would seem and it's too tempting in life to have Envy of someone and say oh well I want their money and I want their career and their relationship or their humor like you're picking little bits and pieces from their life but it's not how it works you got to take the full package and when you look at the full package of those people who you might envy if you actually take like a complete view of their life maybe some of them you would say no that is a great life like Ed Thorp but I I think for a lot of them if you got the full view you would look at it and say oh that's actually a lot different than I thought I frame this one way if you look at this is FL flagrantly anecdotal but among the 10 richest men in the world there are a cumulative 15 divorces among them so it's very easy particularly for young people to say oh that's like I'm jealous of that person I envy that person I want to be that person but I think for a lot of them if you actually got a full view of their life it's not nearly as good as you would think I think people like Elon Musk people like Mark Zuckerberg um they represent these you know incredibly extreme examples that obviously um most people can't even including me can't fathom what a day in their life must be like you know I met Zuck he was on this this podcast and um it seems that he really enjoys doing what he's doing um but I think for me and for most people it's just like so far out of the stratosphere of of of understanding similar to the the amount of wealth that they've acquired it just sort of like what do you even do with all of that and people go well I'd figure it out yeah I'm sure you would but you know it's it's just it's so astronomically outside the scale of one's normal kind of dopamine reward schedules that you it's hard to imagine and what are you going to do buy a buy a plane as big as a state you know you know so um but there's a place in between struggling to quote unquote make it and being at that EX at that extreme where people hit that sweet spot and I think a lot of your work is really aimed at at least Shining Light on the possibility of a sweet spot yeah where you're doing something that you find meaningful U making sufficient income that your anxiety is buffered um you have meaningful relationships in and out of work and you've essentially built quotequote good right I mean I think uh I heard nval say something recently where he said you know you want resources in along the dimensions I just mentioned a healthy Fit Body a calm mind and a home full of love yeah I think it's pretty awesome list right there and it's a lot of work though right and with just to you know check off even one of those four boxes a lot of work right I think because money is so tangible of counting it is so easy and so tangible that even if people know that they're going to put an inordinate amount of effort towards making more money at the expense of their relationships their health their children their friends their family it comes at the expense because if I were to say you know how do I increase my income by 10% it's like I can wrap my head around that I can give you a number of what that would be and how I might be able to do it but if I said how do I get my kids to love me 10% more like ah I don't I have no idea how to measure that or how to even pursue it so even if I want that because it's hard it's not tangible it's much easier to ignore and just pursue the thing that you can count which is money do you have a dog I do golden retriever I was going to say you want them to love you 10% more get them a puppy but but it sounds like you already did that I'm just I'm only half kidding um I would say that you know dogs are not only unconditional love but uh they have the ability to to give on a on a you know daily basis multiple times per day in a way I mean they give love as as readily as they receive love it's just it's just like this perfect reciprocal Loop right and they're constantly in the moment they're just living right there this is great cartoon a lot of people have probably seen it it's uh a a guy and a dog sitting on a lake and the guy's thought bubble coming out of his head is he's thinking about money he's thinking about work he think's thinking about stocks the dog's thought bubble is a picture of them sitting on the lake they're just he's the dog's just right in the moment just enjoying what he's doing right there I think that's like that's my jealousy of when of of my dog when I look at her 24 hours a day everyone will as a dog will recognize this they're just in the moment they just enjoy what they're doing whatever they're doing and everyone including me is either uh worrying thinking about the past or dreaming about the future I love that what's your dog's name if I may Lucy golden retrievers are an amazing breed because they also are universally loving yeah that they they love the person that you know they their owner the most uh but they also love people that stop and meet them on the street not all dogs are like that the worst guard dogs in the world you can break into your house a golden retriever will just come up and wag its tail and like yeah I love it um let's talk about this social comparison thing um I'm trying to make this practical for people that are both partnered and not partnered seems to me that a lot of what I've observed in terms of people who are on the on the conveyor belt work work work work work have a picture in their mind of kind of where that's all going when enough is enough and when they plan to hop off or stay on or how late to stay in large part based on yeah their upbringing yeah kind of who they are are but also the messages that they're getting from typically the one other person that has the greatest degree of input right like you could create a picture where the spouse in either direction is saying like we need more right right that changes the picture completely right um where the spouse just says like I would just like to see you more I don't need any more stuff yeah I just want to see you more we want to see you more these are the sorts of atome dynamics that I think drive a lot of decisions about career not just what careers to pursue but how long to stay in whether or not you try and make partner in a firm whether or not your social media account needs X number more followers or not I think to me this is as important as the social comparison of of your peers at work or online the messages that we receive by the people closest to us about what to be afraid of what the needs are and I don't know that people have really parsed how to you know how to resolve all that um but I'm guessing you probably have some thoughts about this well I think it's it's the balance between it is so difficult because for a lot of people who have families and are working very hard at the core if you said why are you working so hard well to make more money why why do you want more money to take care of my family like it's for very good intentions but it's coming at the expense of time with your family and whatnot so a lot of things it's not that you're making a terrible decision you're you're doing what you think is right and then if you said well how much is enough to take care of your family by and large it's a game of comparison the way that people live 100 years ago that what is a good life 100 years ago is an completely inadequate life today not even 100 years ago you back to go back to our parents generation and say in the 1950s there is a Nostalgia for the 1950s of oh life was so good then and so great and the white picket fence and the dog and the stay-at home mom like it was it was a good picture but what was the definition of a good life back then uh a good middle class life was an 800t house with one bathroom for four people and camping for your annual vacation you would describe life that most people would say that's inadequate today that's not my definition of a good life today so that is Shifting all the time and therefore you're out you're you're saying like well how much money do you need to be happy the truth is I need more money than than the next family than the next person it's this continuous chain and I think a lot of that is just Evolution it's a competition for resources and it doesn't matter how much money you have what matters is that you have more money than the next person that's the that's the sad Truth for a lot of this and therefore you can easily imagine a world in which my grand kids are earning on average way more money than we are today and have way better resources Better Health better Technologies and they're no happier for it and they don't feel any more relieved for it they don't feel like they can scale back and work less for it because they're going to be competing with other people that have all those things John maer kan's a great Economist very famously predicted a world where people would be working 20 hours a week because technology was going to make it so we didn't need to work and that's not how it works whatsoever we are working less than we did back when everybody was a farmer but not nearly as as as as little as we could be if we still had the expectations of a 1950s family living in an 800t house if we had those expectations people could be working way less but it's all a competition between other people so even if 100 years from now a middle class families living in a 5,000 foot house with a spaceship in their backyard if that becomes the norm you don't take you don't appreciate it any of it I mean if you took someone 100 years ago if you took John Rockefeller the richest man in the world 100 years ago and brought brought him to today and showed him a middle class family in America he would say what is this thing Advil you take a pill that makes your headache go away what he you have sunscreen you just rub this on the face you don't get sunburnt he would his jaw would be on the floor but nobody appreciates that today like he would because it's just common place you your your definition of a good life is I expect to have that so it's always going to be the case that the reason we're working hard is to take care of our family and what we feel like is an adequate amount is a growing level over time I should also say that that is by and large a great thing the reason Society progresses is because most people wake up in the morning feeling a little bit inadequate whatever I have today is not enough and I need to go work harder to get more that's why we have good technology and economic growth over time so at the macro level it's a great thing that's what pushes Society forward and better medical Technologies all better Technologies but the individual level it creates this hamster wheel of a constant feeling of inadequacy that we try to compensate for by working harder and working harder even when it comes at the expense of things that should be more dear to us like our friends and family and health and with social media we now have access to Millions if not billions of comparison points whereas just 30 years ago even 20 years ago we only had access to local comparison points like the people in your neighborhood drove certain types of cars now online you can see people that you went to high school with that have certain lives and their vacations that are spectacular relative to the ones that you know one typically has I'd like to to talk about this notion of social comparison as as a function of place um we can touch on some major cities we were doing this before we started recording it's kind of fun to do like in the Bay Area in Silicon Valley area where I grew up um it seems like there's a a High um there's a high value placed on the people who manage to do things that Wick out to the entire world the building of companies or technologies that go everywhere it's not just because of Facebook and Instagram it's um also because of Biotech it's because of all sorts of things um apple right I mean there's a whole history of that um what would you say for like New York City what like what is the dominant message that's being pumped into the psyche of New Yorkers um and by the way I love New York City but it'd be fun to play this game a little bit as an example and then we'll then Wick it out to to people regardless of where they live in the world this is one of those things where what is so good and beneficial for society is what makes indiv miserable so I think what is the message here in Los Angeles or in New York or or any other big city San Francisco the message is waking up in the morning and feeling inadequate because you are surrounded by people who at least look like they're doing better than you and you say I have to I have to chase that person I have to get what they have that is great for society that's where we get new technologies new Innovations and growth at the individual level it's very difficult I grew up out in the woods in Lake Tahoe and in that region uh if you are a dentist let's say you are on top of the world you are the richest guy in town everybody looked up to you you had the nicest house the nicest car if you are a family dentist here in Los Angeles you don't stick out whatsoever you might you might feel like you are so far behind because you're surrounded by legitimate billionaires and so I think it's interesting to ask is a dentist happier in Lake Tahoe or here I think it's probably in Lake Tahoe because your comparison group is so much less especially back in the pre-social media days the states that are statistically the happiest in the United States it's not it's not for cities it's not Los Angeles it's not New York tends to be in the midwest where wonderful places whatnot but less competitive than the grind of the big cities and so but that's where you know if at the individual where are you happiest it's where you have less comparison but for society what is better it's when you have a huge competition for getting ahead so I don't know I I don't know where I come down on that of like where I would want to be of course I want to be happy as an individual but I want to live in a in a society that is moving ahead and the reason it's moving ahead is because most people wake up feeling inadequate you GRE up in Tahoe yeah um I love Lake Tahoe but can I ask you did you grow up being competitive or thinking about um how well people skied or snowboarded yes absolutely it was also I lived in Tahoe pre pre- Tech money it's very different now because so much Bay Area Tech money just flooded into it it's its own little Hampton now but back in the day it was like I felt like when I grew up normal people drove old pickup trucks and rich people drove new pickup trucks that was the difference between rich and poor and both in a city like Los Angeles New York and in a social media World especially it's normal people drive Honda Civics and rich people have private jets like the the stratification between them is is just blown so far out of proportion I see this with my nine-year-old son who like a lot of kids watches Mr Beast who I think is great I think he's an awesome awesome guy but it's completely warped my son's sense of money because Mr Beast will be like oh keep your hand on the table and the and the last person with their hand wins a million dollars it's like if if if that's your sense of money it's complet warped and and skewed and so look I it's it's it's a tough way to live and I think the more of that angst that people have of I'm inadequate I need to get ahead the better Society is going to be the more technology we're going to have great example of this is what decades were the most technologically Innovative by far it's not even close it was 1930s the Great Depression and the 1940s World War II when Society was on fire that's when every business every scientist every entrepreneur woke up every morning and said I need to figure this out right now today immediately during the Great Depression if you were a business owner it was if I don't figure out a way to become more efficient I'm bankrupt tomorrow so that was the birth of a lot of the assembly lines it was the birth of the grocery store the birth of the laundromat every business got more more uh uh just better at at at what they do and the ones that didn't went out of business immediately World War II was if we don't figure out new technologies uh we're we're we're going to lose everything Hitler's going to control the planet so that was nuclear energy radar jets go on down the list of things that we benefit from today happen because of that social angst that we had back then and so I think there's so much evidence that Society progresses when things are a little bit on fire not too much on fire because then you just get overwhelmed with it but if you have a little bit of angst of I need to wake up I I need to do this and when society's become fat and happy and decadent or when companies do this companies that just are minting money and there's no pressure on it they have more money than they know to do with that's the downfall of a lot of companies Sears IBM Intel Boeing who are either not around or are shells of their former S I think you can tie a lot of that to the success that they had in the past when there was no pressure to innovate and get and get ahead it was just a culture of we have so much lying around here that we can do anything that we want I I I had a guy tell me one time who said every business should have a little bit of debt uh because it keeps you in check keeps your Ambitions in line of waking up and being like no I have to succeed this year because we have debt to pay off and when you have too much freedom and a little bit too much autonomy you have a higher chance of just letting it slip away what made you great when you are young and poor and broke and hungry uh slips away when the wealthier you become tell me what you think of this mental exercise as you're describing this to me I'm thinking about um how at different stages of my career first academic science and I still teach but I'm shut down my animal lab still involved in some human research but mainly focused on the podcast the these days um I can look to different things around me that were the the force is pulling on me I like to think in terms of carrot and stick you know for those that don't know what that is because we have a lot of listeners from outside the US carrot you know carrot is the thing you're working towards the the enticing thing the reward stick is the is the punishment carrot and stick because frankly that's how the brain works carrot and stick right um and a lot of what we're talking about today is carrot and sticks of different different sizes different types etc for every stage of my career graduate student postto professor before tenure Professor after getting tenure it's kind of interesting concept people think of it as job for life but it's really academic freedom and you're still on the fundraising treadmill or even as a podcaster you know like what the force was inside me and not trying to make this about me I just kind of I know that there are different people that I'm trying to satisfy and of course satisfy my own curiosity and intellect but there there are forces there's the I'm part of a group I'm part of a team here I can't let them down so it doesn't matter how well I slept last night I happened to sleep pretty well last night but doesn't matter I got to show up right got to suit up and show up as they say do you think it's worthwhile for people to stop wherever they are in their life Arc and just think about like where are these these forces pulling us the carrots and the sticks because I think there in lies a lot of information um are you working for an expectation that you need to fulfill because you did it before I sometimes think about professional athletes they sometimes have a shorter professional life than in other careers because just physical capabilities give away but you know like what drives them I often want to know like what pulls them like where do they feel obligated you know not just you know what the drive is but where do they feel obligated where do they feel like kind of pulled is it to the general public is it their parents is it their Bank account is it the fear that they're going to have to retire at some point do you ever think about this kind of stuff I think a lot of it is tied to your identity of just who do you see in the mirror when you wake up every morning and if your identity is I'm a professional athlete if your identity is I'm a podcaster I am a rich person whatever it might be then that's that's what's pulling you it's that source of your identity so this gets back to the Paul Graham idea of keep your identity small I think he met it in meant it mainly in the context of politics of politics can just poison your identity and it it it really affects your thinking but keeping your identi small for a lot of things I think is a great point of view the more you look in the mirror and say I am a blank doesn't matter what that is I'm a professor I'm an author whatever it is it's hard to give that up because it's part of your identity I saw this with my own with my own dad who was a he was a doctor and he retired and he went back to work a year later because I think at least part of it was when he looked in the mirror he had to say I am a doctor that was his identity and when he retired he couldn't say that anymore and it drove him crazy I think that's true for a lot of people now that could be great for him it was great and I think for me my identity I think my core identity is I'm a father I'm a husband I hope to be a friend but then maybe it's I'm an author and if I had to give that up it might might sting a little bit it's not maybe the core of my identity but it's right there and I think for a lot of people if you're successful core to their identity is I'm a person who makes a lot of money I'm a person who makes X dollars per year and they're unable to give that up and that's that again I think if we're talking about money that's when money becomes a liability is when it's ingrained in your identity and it's controlling you you're not using it as a tool it's using you as its little marionette doll to control you every day and I I think that's that's when a lot of people go astray with their happiness with money is when it starts controlling them because it's so core to who they see in the mirror every day yeah that's like that cartoon of the person standing with a little cage in front of their face like they're they're giving up Freedom by virtue of some mental construct right I wonder if um perhaps even better than uh Paul's idea of shrinking one's ident to make it operational and make it verb based because it's one thing to say I'm going to not use my professional title of podcast or Professor author doctor but if one gets to the verb function that drove the pursuit of things in the first place I enjoy doing this I'm a curious person like like you know I have the I seem to mention him all the time and I'm just going to do it because it's my podcast um Rick rubin's a close friend and I feel so lucky for that friendship of course I love love the music he's produced but that's not why I love the friendship I happen to just really think Rick's a great guy but because he's so verb and action-based it's about almost everything Rick talks about in terms of creativity and productivity is about discarding with titles and concepts of who you were before and just being in the verb state of wherever you happen to be at that point in your life and creating offerings yeah and he actually likes to remove the concept of an audience he actually talks about this is your offering to God and the the audience may or may not like it but that in his words are the way is the way to frame it because otherwise you end up trying to satisfy people absolutely and then you're no longer in the process of of of exploring your curiosity or creativity so yeah I've decided at this moment and I'll make it I'll put it on record that I'm not going to think of myself as a podcaster I mean I did a lot of things I did you know pursued skateboarding pursued you tropical fish tanks pursued you know uh science and and research scien teaching which you know and then this public education and podcasting I fully expect that in 5 to 10 years I'll be doing something completely different but it'll still be attached to the verb state that drove every single one of those professions yeah or every every single one of those Pursuits because as Rick's taught me it's the energy that you need to continue to tap into that is self-rewarding the feelings of delight of friction and then release when you solve a problem it's not really about the profession or the title or even the the resources that come from that but that in fact the greatest resources in particular Financial Resources coming from identifying the verb state of being in pursuit of something that's truly unique to you yeah and that changes over time I'm always amazed at these examples like the Warren buffets and these people have been investing their whole life you pointed this out in your book that one of the the uh fundamental things about Buffett being so successful is that he's had a lot of time investing since he was 11 and he's 93 right it doesn't seem like he needs another venue it seems like he's got dialed that's his venue if he were if you were a golfer he'd be golfing at 93 yeah he's he's doing it because he loves to do it I think I think it's for me as a writer what's always been the case wonder if this and I think this might might might really apply to your own career I've always written for an audience of one which is myself I just want to write things that I think are interesting I want to write stories that I find appealing I want to write it in a style that I would enjoy reading and I don't I don't care that much about the audience who might read it of course I I want them to read it and maybe buy the books and enjoy it but I'm writing for myself and I think you always do your best work when you do that if you're writing or producing a podcast for an audience of one which is you and so um I think if you're doing it otherwise it's performative and and people do much worse work they're much less creative they're much less enjoyable when it's when it's performative when you start off by asking what does the audience want to hear or see do that but that's what most people do and even what does every writing 101 teacher teach their students know your audience I don't I don't think it's good it's good advice because know your audience very quickly becomes Pander to your audience not just as writers but in any form of work that you do pandering to your boss pandering to your quarterly metrics whatever that might be you're always going to do your best work if you have the independence and the autonomy to have an audience of one which is yourself Brian chesky of Airbnb talks about this he's like don't build a product that a thousand people like build a product that 100 people love or that one person you love and use it that's when you're going to do always do your best work you're not trying to manage a product or a book or a podcast towards some Metric or goal you're doing it cuz you love doing it much easier said than done for a lot of careers because if you're working for a company you you do have metrics you have to follow you do have formulas and policies you have to follow so it's not that everyone can do this but it's it's unavoidable that you're always going to do your best work when it's yours and you're doing it for yourself not because you're trying to reach some Metric I guess the phrase you know be a lifer I used to think that meant if you were a musician stay a musician if you're in finance stay in finance but I think now I'm going to revise that to one wants to be a life for at tapping into the energy of pursuing things that are really meaningful to them in that moment yeah in that phase of life because it's so different I mean when I was a kid I was obsessed with fish tanks and tropical birds and then skateboarding punk rock music and it changed I mean the venue changed but we don't really change as in in terms of identity very much right these professions and the these bank accounts and we don't actually we're not fundamentally Changed by them it's it's really a bunch of verb States that that drive all this and I actually hope that in 20 years I'm doing something different that I'm not writing about the same topic so maybe I maybe I hope I'm still writing and thinking and reading and learning but if you're always doing the same thing I think someone like Buffett is an incredibly uh Oddball Rare Bird who's been doing the same thing for 80 years and loves it like I I want to grow and adapt and evolve in in what I'm doing but if something becomes core to your identity then it's hard to release that and let go you feel like you have to keep doing it even when it's not that fun anymore and you're not getting the the the dopamine Rush of trying something new you're attached something you keep being a lawyer whatever it might be because that's your identity even when you don't like it anymore think about Michael Jordan playing baseball which he did for a little while he wanted to play professional baseball yeah so he gave himself the shot I think it's awesome even though it didn't turn out as well as it basketball turned out for him it just because it it just reflected his inherently competitive you know high performance nature to keep doing something or bzo so I keep bringing up but you build the biggest most successful company in the world Amazon what what do you do in your retirement you start a rocket company kind of thing it's like you you like maybe he did I I don't know this I don't want to put words in his mouth but maybe he did get a little bit bored with Amazon and it was he needed to do something else but he's not going to retire he's not going to play golf he's not going to sit on his boat he's going to go build another company always have to be doing something even if it's growing and adapting you're working on a new book and uh I eagerly anticipate the release of that new book when's it coming out September 2025 okay so we got a little while to wait um are you willing to share a few things that you're thinking about or that um you know we might to see in that book yeah I think there there are pieces of the book that you and I have talked about today uh but the book is called the art of spending money and I I make a point of the book is not called the science of spending money because spending money is not a science it's not something where you can say here's the formula that works for everybody it's an art and what is an art it is different for everybody it's subjective it's often contradictory and that's I think that's what way to spend money should be so at no point in the book do I say here's how you should spend your money because I don't think anybody can accurately do that for a broad audience it's a look at the psychology of Envy of keeping up with the Joneses of social aspiration of identity that we've been talking about managing money and kids of being jealous of other people of wanting to get attention for yourself it's a look at the psychology of that without offering any firm concrete advice which I would say a lot of people don't like that a lot of people are like well just tell me what to do but I I try to make a point in the beginning same with my first book psychology and money of I can't tell you what to do because I don't know you and what's what's right for you is going to be maybe not right for me you have to figure it out for yourself but I can tell you what's probably going through your head as you're going on that journey I can tell you about the psychological pitfalls and challenges and advice uh of that is that is psychological it's not what you should do but here's how most people and why most people fall for envy and why if you understand the mechanics of Envy how silly it can be that's that's what the book dives into in a lot of ways what sounds like you're describing is um kind of identifying the sources of self- Seduction yeah where we we by virtue of social media or just by virtue of Being Human We compare what we have to see if it really is what it is uh you would think that we would be pretty good as a species at just experiencing things kind of like the dog sitting next to the lake given that we can understand that we have this propensity to you know compare and um to regret things of past but not be able to anticipate future regret you'd think we be we would be better at that but clearly we're not well this I guess this gets back to basic Evolution Evolution doesn't care if you're happy it cares that you reproduce and you grow over time that's that's what it's maximizing for it doesn't really care whether you have a good time during the process make more of yourself and take care of the young and then you're dispensable keep going Lis K says more of me that's that's what we're trying to do and and and whether you're happy or not doesn't doesn't really play into the situation and actually might reward the person who is gaining a ton of resources even if they're miserable in the process who's making a ton of money in the process even if they wake up miserable every morning they're gaining a lot of resources that might increase their their Fitness over time happiness doesn't play much of a role do you think birth rates are going down because um people feel that they have to use more of what they earn for themselves or that it's harder to establish a relationship to money and resources that makes them feel capable of taking care of others I think it's it's so complex it doesn't lead to simple answers but I think there is a lot of evidence that what happens why societies all over the world this has always been the case have fewer kids when they become wealthier is because their expectations for those kids go up so if you're living in a in a poor Society poor economy or during a poor era you could have 10 kids because you knew all 10 of those kids or at least the ones who survived were going to become Farmers that's what they were going to do and uh that was that was their only hope that was all they could do and you didn't need to provide a lot of resources for them if I give them basic food and shelter and clothes that's all they need to become a farmer and I think if you fast forward to today's economy the expectations are so much so much higher where you want your kid to become a PhD to become an astronaut to become a hedge fund whatever it might be and there because of that you need to provide so much more resources for that kid I need to Foster their growth and development from the time that they are infants and provide them tutors and after school activities and maybe send them to private school and definitely send them to a college which is going to cost a fortune because the expect ations for what you need to provide are so much higher you feel like you can only provide that to maybe one maybe two kids which would have been a a couple Generations ago three or four kids and a couple Generations before that 10 kids there's also a very Grim statistic about it used to why do people used to have 10 kids because six of them died before they were five and so if you needed those hands on the farm you needed to have a lot of kids to make sure you had a lot of teenagers who could help you one day and so I think we're blessed to now live in a world where thankfully the infant mortality rate is collapsed so much that we don't need to play that Lottery game that we used to what are you teaching your kids about money and it what age should uh we start to do that and for those listening who don't have kids um I suppose it's never too late to learn I think one one of the points I always make that I've learned the hard way parenting is I I I don't think you need to sit your kids down and teach them about money because they're paying attention whether you know it or not kids are so incredibly good at learning they're better learn they're better at learning than adult are particularly for things like language and whatnot but you don't need to say sit your kids down and say this is how much we spend and this is what we value and this is why I say they're paying attention they're figuring it out every time they hear you say I can't afford this every time we're at the store and they say oh look this is on sale let's get two of these they're making a mental note of everything every time they hear you bicker about work every time they hear you talk about a raise even if it's just in the Next Room they're piecing it all together and I don't think they even know it but they're so good at learning that they're building a mental model and so even if never sit your kids down and teach them by the time certainly that they're teenagers they know a lot about money and maybe some of those things are are good maybe some is bad but they're paying attention and so I think the only thing you can do as a kid or as a parent I should say is to lead by example because we talked about this earlier the propensity to Rebel as as a kid as a teenager you talked about the smoking ads where they just wanted to do the opposite of what everyone else is doing I think particularly for teenagers which I don't have yet um but if you sit them down and say this is what you should do you should always do this you should never do that their propensity to Rebel is enormous so I think I I should think it can backfire if you try to teach them I think the best you can do the only thing you can do is lead by example with people one thing that a lot of not just very wealthy people but moderately wealthy people will say is and ask is how do I teach my kids about money without spoiling them how do I use my money to help my kids without spoiling them that's that's a big topic for a lot of people even if you're like a a middle- class family how do I you know leave a small inheritance or help my kids should I buy them a new car or should I help them through College I think a big thing that is is easy to overlook uh is two things you might think as a parent that you are teaching your kid grit and independence by withholding resources from them and you're doing it very well-intentioned you need to earn your I earn my money and this is mine you got to go figure out your own I think it is very easy to overlook that you are not teaching your kid Independence and grit you're teaching them to resent you and I I have a good friend Chris Davis who told the story now he's an extreme example Chris Davis's grandfather Shelby Davis who was a billionaire investor one of the greatest investors of all time and Chris tells a story that uh when he was a kid and his grandfather took him skiing his grandfather would say if you want me to buy you a lift ticket you need to hike up the hill first and ski down hike to the top and if you do that then I'll buy you a lift ticket and Chris said the lesson that they learned from that was not grit and Independence and hard work the lesson they learned from it was Grandpa's kind of a jerk sometimes and it's I think that's an extreme example but you see that a lot with with kids one like very practical takeaway from this is that I think as a parent you have to live the same lifestyle as your kids it's very difficult to say Mom and Dad fly first class but you're back in coach does anyone actually do that oh absolutely and maybe that's maybe that's still a very extreme example but what the you think as a parent that the kid is learning is oh if I work as hard as Mom and Dad one day I'll be sitting up there and they don't the lesson they learn is Mom and Dad are think that they are superior to us or Mom and Dad are superior to me I'm inferior to them I think this is why you see a lot of very wealthy kids who are just psychologically broken because I I think you have well-meaning parents who are like look we're very wealthy but you're not you got to earn your way and all the kid hears throughout their life is I'm inferior I'm inferior I'm inferior I'm inferior and by the time they they become adults that's it's so ingrained into who they are that they can't take a step forward they can't advocate for themselves and so look that's that's what the very wealthy deal with but I think that's that's what I think a lot about with kids the other thing that every parent with more than one kid will uh understand and recognize this my two kids are could not be more different their personalities their goals uh even with the same parents living under the same roof they are roof they are a million miles apart and so had if you say had like what what are you teaching your kids like I I I don't know who they're going to be when they grow up I don't know what their goals or their aspirations are going to be so is it right for me to tell my daughter like oh here's how you can save and become super wealthy over time what if she doesn't want to live that life what if she does have more of a YOLO personality of like oh I just want to go travel the world I don't I have no aspirations to become super wealthy and retire early uh so you have to let them them figure it out for themselves and realize that what might be right for you and what may have been right for the era in which you and I grew up in might not be right for them it might not fit the era that they grew up in I like this saying um none of us know what it's like to be you know picking age 13 years old in 2024 we think we do because we were 13 years old at one point your earlier descriptions of uh depriving kids of the first class ticket um putting them in coach and and the the parents flying In First Class it it makes me realize that we like to think that those sorts of things will drive integration of the lesson but each one of your examples pointed to the fact that kids are integrating based on the emotion they experience at the time they're not thinking about the larger lesson they're thinking about in there in their moment they're think I'm hiking up this hill and this sucks and they're not piecing together things over time I'm like okay I'm doing this and he's trying to teach me a lesson right there it's really uh they're very attached to their immediate feelings right and maybe it would be different in Chris Davis's example if the grandpa hiked up the hill with them because then the lesson you're taking is like oh we're going to do this together and and that is teaching the value of hard work I'm going to do it with you I'm going to suffer with you so leading by example rather than by humiliation I think is the way to do it with kids when I was a kid um my dad used to walk me to this point along our street where then he would split off to go to work he so a scientist he would go to his laboratory and I'd go off to to kindergarten in first grade and I remember one day asking him what he did for a living and uh he's a physicist and uh and he said well I'm a physicist and I said what's that and he explained a little bit about what it was and I'll never forget we still talk about this he and I I'll never forget um I said do you like it and he said well you know that feeling the night before your birthday I said yeah and he said I feel like that every day and then I think he also said and I'm still a little bit murky on this one I need to touch base with him about this sometime again soon was he said yeah you don't always get presence it doesn't always work out but the feeling that you might or that you're likely going to or there's a possibility that just feels so good and I think I must have internalized that lesson because what I like is work yeah I don't think I'm addicted to work although someone in my life have accused me of that um and I'm willing to be open to that possibility but it wasn't even really about Discovery it was about the possibility of discovery and so I I think in in terms of teaching to kids and teaching to peers and you know teaching among humans getting people in to think about the verb states that really motivate them from the best place seems to be the kind of General theme throughout today's discussion and in your book somewhat I'm not trying to summarize to to too fine a point here but if I may it seems like get and what Rick Rubin has said about you know he has this like just Supernatural track record at bringing out the best creat ative elements in people from different genres of music it seems to be about tapping into these verb states of like what is the thing that brings out your best as opposed to thinking about the rewards that come from that yeah but it's hard right we we see those numbers we see those the followers the dollars Etc we see the metrics of comparison it's tough it's it's it's there's a work to this that is not obvious I think it'll always be like that we're never going to live in a world where people uh don't compare themselves to others we're never going to live in a world where people don't feel in adequate to others who have more than them but back to kids I think this is a a great Pace to place TI this together if you ask most parents what do you want for your kids most parents will say I just want them to be happy I just hope I I hope they're happy one day and then if you said well do you hope that your children are rich and successful parents might say like yeah but mainly just happy like I I just want them to be happy regardless of what they're doing if they're a kindergarten teacher I want them to be happy and I think um the parents themselves say that because they haven't done that themselves because the parents themselves have chased money over happiness and they see the downside of it and I that's that's very common and that's why they say I I I hope my kid does this because I haven't done a good job of that myself because the Temptation is to do that is to pursue something that's not going to make you is going to make you richer but not necessarily happier now that's not an argument against money or working hard which I want to do I want to work hard and make money and have more money of course but I think you there's such a stark difference between using money as a tool to make yourself happier versus as a yard stick to compare yourself against others by and so much in the modern world is is the latter we're not using money to make ourselves happier or Freer or more independent or to sleep better or to spend more time with the people we enjoy we use money to measure ourselves against other people it's just do I have more than you is my car faster than yours my house bigger than yours and all of that is completely separated from what we actually want like for our kids and ultimately for ourselves which is can I use this to become happier and live a better life what a wild concept but it seems just spoton so we need to think about money a little differently or a lot differently if we are to get the most satisfaction from our work and from resources it requires a lot of looking in the mirror into saying like who am I and what do I want I think that's the biggest thing particularly when we started this conversation by saying everybody is different what's right for me is not right for you inherent in that is that you have to understand yourself and a lot of people a lot of financial damage is done when people have a financial plan that is right for another person but it's wrong for them and that's dangerous because it's the right financial plan maybe for a lot of other people so it makes sense it's rational it makes sense on paper on the spreadsheet looks good but it doesn't fit your personality that's when a lot of damage is done so I think to do better with money you need to spend a lot of time thinking about who you are and your family and your goals and your aspirations realizing that all those things will change and adapt over time so what was right for you 10 years ago might not be right today and you know in a way that might seem selfish like tuning out the rest of the world tuning out other people and co-workers and and neighbors and whatnot and being just saying how can I use this as a tool to become happier to live a little bit better life like what's the purpose of money if it's not that I love it well Morgan thank you so much for doing the work that you do it's an incredibly unique perspective on this thing that we all have to deal with grapple with and and uh hopefully can develop a a symbiotic relationship with money and it's clear from talking to you today and also from reading your book that you know there's a a strong central cord of benevolence in all of this I I don't know if that was your intent it seems to just come through in who you are um but when I read your book and as we talked today it's just so clear like that you want the best for people uh so I think that's an important thing to highlight because there are a lot of people out there telling people how to make money uh what to do or not to do with their money but you're telling us how to live more meaningful lives which is uh something just order of magnitude more important so for that and the work that you've done and that you're doing I'm eagerly anticipating your book next September uh

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman. And I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is episode three of the podcast. And it is office hours. Office hours, as many of you know, it's where students come to the office of the professor, sit down and ask questions, requesting clarification about things that were confusing, or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic with more depth and detail. Somebody asked, what is the role of moonlight and fire-- I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle or things of that sort-- in setting circadian rhythms? Is it OK to view moonlight at night? Or will that wake me up? Will a fire in my fireplace or using candlelight be too much light? Great question. Turns out that moonlight, candlelight, and even a fireplace, if you have one of these roaring fires going in the fireplace, do not reset your circadian clock at night and trick your brain into thinking that it's morning, even though, if you've ever sat close to a fireplace or even a candle, that light seems very bright. And there are two reasons for that are very important. The first one is that these neurons in your eye that I discussed in the previous episode, these melanopsin ganglion cells, also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells, those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day. And those cells respond best to the blue yellow contrast present in the rising and setting sun, so-called low solar angle sun, also discussed in the previous episode. But those cells adjust their sensitivity such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight, even a full moon, a really bright moon, or fire, because we talked about just how crucial it is to avoid bright lights between the hours of about 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM, except when you need to view things for sake of safety or work and so forth. I also received a lot of questions about red light. In principle, red light will not stimulate the melanopsin retinal neurons that wake up the brain and circadian clock and signal daytime. However, most of the red lights, in particular the red lights that come on these sheets or these products that people are supposed to view them in order to access a number of health effects, those are way too bright and would definitely wake up your body and brain. So if you're thinking about red light for sake of avoiding the negative effects of light later in the day and at night, then you want that red light to be very, very dim, certainly much dimmer than it is on most of those commercial products. Now, do you need red lights? No, although red lights are rather convenient because you can see pretty well with them on. But if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock. They won't have this dopamine disrupting thing that we talked about in the previous podcast. OK, a huge number of people asked me about light through windows. Setting your circadian clock with sunlight coming through a window is going to take 50 to 100 times longer. You can download the free app Light Meter. You can have a bright day outside or some sunlight. Hold up that app. Take a picture. It'll tell you how many lux are in that environment. Now, close the window. And if you want, close the screen. Or don't open the screen. You can do all sorts of experiments. And you'll see that it will at least half the amount of lux. And it doesn't scale linearly-- meaning let's say I get 10,000 lux outside, 5,000 looking out through an open window. And then I close the window. And it's 2,500 lux. It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight for twice as long if it's half as many lux. It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means you look for five minutes. It doesn't scale that way just because the biology doesn't work that way. Best thing to do is to get outside if you can. If you can't, next best thing to do is to keep that window open. It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts. Why is it OK to wear prescription lenses and contacts when those are glass also but looking through a window diminishes the effect? Well, we should think about this. The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes by prescription or on your eyes are designed to focus the light onto your neural retina. So let's think about why I'm making some of these recommendations because I think it can really empower you with the ability to change your behavior in terms of light viewing and other things, depending on time of year, depending on other lifestyle factors. The important point to understand is that early in the day, your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms are looking for a lot of light. OK, I want to talk about seasonal changes in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism. So as all you know, the Earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis. So part of that day, we're bathed in sunlight, depending on where we are. The other half of the day or part of the day, we're in darkness. The Earth also travels around the sun. 365 days is the time that it takes one year to travel around that sun. The Earth is tilted. It's not perfectly upright. So the Earth is tilted on its axis. So depending on where we are in that 365-day journey and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere, Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere, some days of the year are longer than others. Some are very short. Some are very long. If you're at the equator, you experience less variation in day length and therefore night length. And if you're closer to the poles, you're going to experience some very long days. And you're also going to experience some very short days, depending on which pole you're at and what time of year it is. The simple way to put this is depending on time of year, the days are either getting shorter or getting longer. Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology according to day length, except your brain, body, and cells don't actually know anything about day length. It only knows night length. And here's how it works. Light inhibits melatonin powerfully. If days are long and getting longer, that means melatonin is reduced. If days are getting shorter, that melatonin signal is getting longer. So every cell in your body actually knows external day length and therefore time of year by way of the duration of the melatonin signal. By understanding that light and extended day length inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends to be associated with a more depressed or reduced functioning of these kind of activity-driving and mood-elevating signals and understanding that you have some control over melatonin by way of light, including sunlight but also artificial light, that should empower you, I believe, to make the adjustments so that if you're feeling low, you might ask, how much light am I getting? When am I getting that light? Because sleep is also important for restoring mood. So you need sleep. You can't just crush melatonin across the board and expect to feel good because then you're not going to fall asleep and stay asleep. Melatonin, not incidentally, comes from, is synthesized from serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated with feelings of well-being, provided that proper levels, but well-being of a particular kind, well-being associated with quiescence and calm and the feeling that we have enough resources in our immediate kind of conditions. It's the kind of thing that comes from a good meal or sitting down with friends, or holding a loved one or conversing with somebody that you really bond with. Serotonin does not stimulate action. It tends to stimulate stillness. Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine, which is a reward, feel good neuromodulator that stimulates action. And actually, dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine, to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action. It's actually made from dopamine. So you can start to think about light as a signal that is very powerful for modulating things like sleep and wakefulness but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels. And I talked about this previously. But I'll mention once more that light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels to the point where it can start causing problems with learning and memory and mood. That's one powerful reason to avoid bright light in the middle of the night. Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes, I've been mentioning neuromodulators, things like serotonin and dopamine, which tend to bias certain brain circuits and things in our body to happen and certain brain circuits and things in our body not to happen. One of the ones I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrine, which is a neuromodulator that tends to put us into action, make us want to move. In fact, when it's released in high amounts in our brain and body, it can lead to what we call stress or the feeling of being stressed. Several people asked me, what's the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline? Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands, which sit right above our kidneys. Epinephrine is the exact same molecule, except that it's released within the brain. Epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing. And they tend to stimulate agitation and the desire to move. I got a lot of questions about exercise. What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well? When should I exercise, et cetera? There are basically two forms of exercise that we can talk about, although, of course, I realize there are many different forms of exercise. There's much more nuance to this. But we can talk about cardiovascular exercise, where the idea is to repeat a movement over and over and over continuously. So that would be like running, biking, rowing, cycling, this kind of thing. Or there's a resistance exercise, where you're moving, lifting, presumably putting down also, things of progressively heavier and heavier weight that you couldn't do continuously for 30 minutes. Now, you will see some places, aerobic exercise is best done in the morning and weight training is best done in the afternoon. I think there's far more individual variation than that. I think there are, however, a couple of windows that the exercise science literature and the circadian literature points to as windows related to body temperature in which performance is optimized, injury is reduced, and so on. And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking, three hours after waking, and the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking, which is when temperature tends to peak. A note about working out first thing in the morning-- last time, we talked about non-photic phase shifts. If you exercise first thing in the morning, your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit. There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits that will lead you to want to wake up at the particular time that you exercised the previous three or four days. So that can be a powerful tool. But you still want to get light exposure because it turns out that light and exercise converge to give an even bigger wake up signal to the brain and body. So you might want to think about that. Some people find if they exercise late in the day, they have trouble sleeping. In general, intense exercise does that, whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn't. Many of your questions were about neuroplasticity, which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. There was a question that asked whether or not these really deep biological mechanisms around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera, were subject to neuroplasticity. And indeed, they are. Some of that plasticity is short term. And some of it is more long term. There's a really good analogy here, which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule, where every day, say, at 8:00 AM, noon, and 7:00 PM is when you eat your food-- I'm not suggesting you do this. But let's say you were to do that for a couple of days. After a few days, you would start to anticipate those mealtimes where no matter where you were in the world, no matter what was going on in your life, about 5 to 10 minutes before those meal times, you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated, which is your body's way of trying to get you to forage for food. And that's because of some peptide signals that come from the periphery, from your body, things like hypocretin orexin that signal to the hypothalamus and brainstem to make you active and alert and look for food and feel hungry. So there's kind of an anticipatory circuit that's a chemical circuit. But eventually, over time, the neurons, the neural circuits that control hypocretin orexin would get tuned to the neural circuits that are involved in eating and maybe even smell and taste to create a kind of eating circuit that's unique to your pattern, to your rhythms. The same thing is true for these waking and exercise and other schedules, including ultradian schedules. If you wake up in the morning and start getting your sunlight, you start exercising in the morning, or you exercise in the afternoon, pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that and start to secrete hormones and other signals that prepare your body for the ensuing activity of waking up or going to sleep. So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm, even if that rhythm isn't down to the minute, you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits. And it becomes easier to wake up early if that's your thing or exercise at a particular day if that's your thing. That's the beauty of neuroplasticity. A number of people asked, what can I do to increase plasticity? And that really comes in two forms. There's plasticity that we can access in sleep to improve rates of learning and depth of learning from the previous day or so. And there's this NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, that can be done without sleeping to improve rates of learning and depth of retention, et cetera. So let's consider those both. And you can incorporate these protocols if you like. Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies. First, let's talk about learning in sleep. This is based on some work that I'll provide the reference for. That was published in the journal Science. Excellent journal. Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies done by others in his book Why We Sleep. The studies, just to remind you, are structured the following way. An individual is brought into a laboratory, does a spatial memory task. So there tends to be a screen with a bunch of different objects popping up on the screen in different locations. So it might be a bulldog's face. It might be a cat. Then it might be an apple. Then it might be a pen in different locations. And that sounds trivially easy. But with time, you can imagine, it gets pretty tough to come back a day later and remember if something presented in a given location was something you've seen before and whether or not it was presented in that location or a different location. If you had enough objects and changed the locations enough, this can actually be quite difficult. In this study, the subjects either just went through the experiment or a particular odor was released into the room while they were learning or a tone was played in the room while they were learning. And then during the sleep of those subjects the following night and the following night-- this was done repeatedly for several nights-- the same odor or tone was played while the subjects were sleeping. They did this in different stages of sleep, non-REM sleep and Rapid Eye Movement sleep, REM sleep. They did this with just the tone in sleep. If the subjects had had the odor but not the tone, they did it with putting the tone. If they had had the odor while learning-- so basically, all the controls, all the things you'd want to see done to make sure that it wasn't some indirect effect, some modulatory effect. And what they found was that providing the same stimulus, the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone if the subjects heard a tone while learning, if they just delivered that odor or tone while the subjects slept, rates of learning and retention of information was significantly greater. This is pretty cool. What this means is that you can cue the subconscious brain, the asleep brain, to learn particular things better and faster. So how might you implement this? Well, you could play with this if you want. I don't see any real challenge to this, provided the odor is a safe one and doesn't wake you up and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up. You could do this by having a metronome, for instance, while learning something, playing in the background or particular music and then have that very faintly while you sleep. So you could apply this if you like and try this. The other form of neuroplasticity is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep but the neuroplasticity that you can access with non-sleep deep rest. So NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, as well as short 20 minute naps, which are very close to non-sleep deep rest because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep during short naps unless they're very sleep deprived-- NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning when done for 20 minute bouts to match an approximately 90-minute bout of learning. So what am I talking about? 90-minute cycles are these ultradian cycles that I've talked about previously. And we tend to learn very well by taking a 90-minute cycle, transitioning into some focused mode early in the cycle when it's hard to focus. And then deep focus and learning feels almost like agitation and strain. And then by the end of that 90-minute cycle, it becomes very hard to maintain focus and learn more information. There was a study published in Cell Reports last year-- great journal. Excellent paper showing that 20-minute naps or light sleep of the non-sleep deep rest taken immediately after or close to it-- doesn't have to be immediately after you finish the last sentence of learning or whatever it is or bar of music. But a couple of minutes after transitioning to a period of non-sleep deep rest where you're turning off, the analysis of duration path and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning to a significant degree, both the amount of information and the retention of that information. So that's pretty cool because this is a cost-free, drug-free way of accelerating learning without having to get more sleep but simply by introducing these 20-minute bouts. I would encourage people, if they want to try this to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes of ultradian learning cycle, which brings us to the next thing about learning and plasticity, which is nootropics, a.k.a. smart drugs. [SIGHS] This is a big topic. That sigh was a sigh of concern about how to address nootropics in a thorough enough but thoughtful enough way. There are elements to learning that we've discussed here before that are very concrete, things like the ability to focus and put the blinders on to everything else that's happening around you and in your head mainly, distractions about things you should be doing, could be doing or might be doing, and focus on what you need to do. And then that's required for triggering the acetylcholine neuromodulator. That will then allow you to highlight the particular synapses that will then later change in sleep. So no nootropic allows you to bypass the need for sleep and deep rest. That's important to understand. Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle a bunch of things together. Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine. You can't just ingest more stimulant to be more focused. It doesn't work that way. Most nootropics also include things that increase or are designed to increase acetylcholine, things like Alpha-GPC and other things of that sort. And indeed, there's some evidence that they can increase acetylcholine. So we need the focus component. We need the alertness component. The alertness component comes from epinephrine, traditionally from caffeine stimulation. The acetylcholine stimulation traditionally comes from choline donors or Alpha-GPC, things of that sort. And then you would want to have some sort of off switch because anything that's going to really stimulate your alertness that then provides a crash, that crash is not a crash into the deep, kind of restful slumber that you would want for learning. It's a crash into the kind of-- let's just call it lopsided sleep, meaning it's deep sleep. But it lacks certain spindles and other elements of the physiology-- sleep spindles that really engage the learning process and the reconfiguration of synapses. So right now, my stance on nootropics is that maybe-- maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you-- I'm not recommending it. But in general, it tends to use more of a shotgun approach than is probably going to be useful for learning and memory in the long run. I'd like to continue by talking about the role of temperature in sleep, accessing sleep, staying asleep, and wakefulness. Temperature is super interesting as it relates to circadian rhythms and wakefulness and sleep. First, let's take a look at what's happening to our body temperature across each 24-hour cycle. In general, our temperature tends to be lowest right around 4:00 AM and starts creeping up around 6:00 AM, 8:00 AM, and peaks sometime between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. There's also an important way in which temperature matches day length. In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out, not always. But in general, that's the way it is. And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside. So temperature and day length are also linked. Metabolically, they're linked. Biologically, they're linked-- excuse me. And atmospherically, they're linked for the reasons that we talked about before, about duration of day length and other climate features and so forth. So one of the most powerful things about setting your circadian rhythm properly is that your temperature will start to fall into a regular rhythm. And that temperature has a very strong effect on things like metabolism and when you will feel most willing and interested in exercising. Typically, the willingness to exercise and engage in any kind of activity, mental or physical, is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest, when the slope of that line is greatest. That's why 30 minutes after waking is one of those key windows as well as three hours after waking and then when temperature actually peaks, which is generally-- generally about 11 hours after waking. So this is why we say that temperature and circadian rhythm are linked. But they're actually even more linked than that. We've talked before about how light enters the eye, triggers activation of these melanopsin cells, which then triggers activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian clock. And then I always say the master circadian clock informs all the cells and tissues of your body and puts them into a nice, cohesive rhythm. But what I've never answered was how it actually puts them into that rhythm. And it does it two ways. One is it secretes a peptide. A peptide is just a little protein that floats through the bloodstream and signals to the cells. But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature under which those cells exist. So temperature is actually the effector of the circadian rhythm. Nowadays, there's some interest in cold showers and ice baths. Getting into an ice bath is very interesting because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis. Now, you should know from the previous episode that as that temperature increases, it will shift your circadian rhythm. And which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm will depend on whether or not you're doing it during the daytime or late in the day. If you do it after 8:00 PM, it's going to make your day longer because your body and your central clocks are used to temperature going up early in the day and throughout the day and peaking in the afternoon. If you then increase that further or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8:00 PM after temperature was already falling, even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple of degrees or you do that with exercise-- doesn't have to be with the ice bath-- you are extending, you are shifting forward, you are phase delaying your clock. You're convincing your clock and therefore the rest of your body that the day is still going. You're giving it the perception, the cellular and physiological perception, that the day is getting longer. And you will want to naturally stay up later and wake up later. So for those of you that are having trouble getting up-- and this is going to almost sound laughable. But a cold shower first thing in the morning will wake you up. But that's waking you up in the short term because of a different mechanism, which I'll talk about in a moment. But it also is shifting your clock. It's phase advancing your clock in a way that makes you more likely to get up earlier the next day. It's going to make you want to wake up about half hour to an hour earlier the next day than you normally would. Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling, it will tend to delay and make your body perceive as if the day is getting longer. But temperature is-- again, it's not just one tool to manipulate wake up time and circadian rhythm and metabolism. It is the effector. It is the way that the central circadian clock impacts all the cells and tissues of your body. Light is the trigger. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock that mediates all these changes, also influenced by non-photic influence, like exercise and feeding and things of that sort. But temperature is the effector. Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating. When you travel and you land in a new location and your schedule is inverted 12 hours, one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly is to get on to the local meal schedule. Now, that probably has to do with two effects. One are changes in temperature and eating induced increases in body temperature. Now, you should understand why that would work. As well as eating has this anticipatory secretion of hypocretin orexin that I talked about earlier. Many people asked questions about food and neurotransmitters and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness, and mood, which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover. But I'm going to try and distill out the most common questions. We've talked a lot about neuromodulators, like dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine. You may notice in those discussions that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan. Tryptophan actually comes from the diet. It comes from the foods that we eat. Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. It comes from the foods that we eat. And then once we ingest them, those compounds are circulated to a variety of different cells and in tissues. But it is true that our food and the particular foods we eat can influence things like neuromodulator levels to some extent. Nuts and meats, in particular red meats, tend to be rich in things like tyrosine. That tells you right there that because tyrosine is the precursor of dopamine and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine, that those foods tend to lend themselves toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine and the sorts of things that are associated with wakefulness. Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat also impacts our wakefulness. If we eat a lot of anything, whether or not it's ribeye steaks, rice, or cardboard-- please don't eat cardboard-- your stomach, if it's very distended, will draw a lot of blood into your gut. And you will divert blood from other tissues. And you'll become sleepy. So it's not just about food content. It's also about food volume. Fasting states generally are associated with more alertness, epinephrine, and so forth. And fed states are generally associated with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin and the kind of things that lend themselves more towards sleep and less toward alertness. And fed states are generally associated with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin and the kind of things that lend themselves more towards sleep and less toward alertness. There are a couple effects of food that are independent-- or I should say, a couple effects of eating because the food won't do it when it's sitting across the table-- but of eating that are powerful for modulating circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera. And that's because every time we eat, we get eating-induced thermogenesis regardless of what we eat. And now you know from the discussion about temperature that if you're eating early in the day, you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier so that you'll want to wake up earlier the next day. If you're eating very late in the day, even if you can fall asleep after that, there's a tendency for you to want to sleep later the next day. So as we finish up, I just want to offer you the opportunity to do an experiment. It might be interesting, just a suggestion, to write down for each day when you went outside to get sunlight and when you did that relative to waking. And then you might just take note of when you exercised. And you might note when you might have felt chilled or cold if you do. Or you might have felt particularly hot or if you woke up in the middle of the night when you felt particularly hot. And then the last thing you might want to do is just write down if and when you did a Non-Sleep Deep Rest protocol, NSDR protocol, anything that you're using to deliberately teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness to more calmness in the waking state. By doing this, you can start to reveal some really interesting patterns. It's really about taking the patterns of behaviors of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise and superimposing that on what you're learning in this podcast and elsewhere, of course, and what you already know and trying to see where certain problems or problems or pain points might be arising. Maybe you start to find that using cold exposure early in the day is great for you. But using it late, if it's too late in the day, that's not great. Or if you're into the sauna or even-- some people, including myself, if I take a hot shower or sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night, well, then I get a compensatory decrease in body temperature. And I sleep great, provided I hydrate well enough because that can be kind of a dehydrating thing to sit in hot conditions. But if I do the sauna early in the day, unless I exercise immediately afterward, then I tend to get the temperature drop, which makes sense because we can get in the sauna. You get vasodilation. You throw off a lot of heat. And then you generally get a compensatory drop in temperature. If you do that early in the day, that's right about the time that temperature is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body. So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists of your own physiology, of your own brain and body, and seeing how the various tools that you may or may not be using are affecting your patterns of sleep, your patterns of attention and wakefulness. It's vitally important that if you do this, that you know that it's not about trying to get onto an extremely rigid schedule. It's really about trying to identify variables that are most powerful for you and that push you in the direction that you want to go and changing the variables that are pushing your body and your mind in the directions that you don't want to go. Self-experimentation is something that should be done slowly, carefully. You don't want to be reckless about this. And this is where I would say manipulating one or two variables at a time is really going to be best as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once to really identify what it is that's most powerful for you. And above all, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: How to Limit Your Exposure to Endocrine Disruptors

Description:
Dr. Shanna Swan discusses the dangers of bisphenol A (BPA) and its chemical relatives, emphasizing the importance of reducing fluid intake from plastic vessels and the prevalence of these chemicals in canned foods.

Transcript Language: English
When it comes to reducing BPA exposure and some of these forever chemicals that you mentioned, seems like reducing fluid intake from plastic vessels is going to be number one. The primary source of BPA is in the lining of cans. So any drink, or soup, or anything that comes in a can. Any can, all cans? Any can, unless it's a high-end, you know, elite company that's made the change from BPA to an alternative lining, and they'll say that. So, and by the way, BPA has some bad relatives such as BPS and BPF. And maybe you'd be interested in this story. So when it came out that BPA was estrogenic, which is what it is. And by the way, it's kind of the evil twin of phthalates because phthalates are anti-androgenic and BPA is estrogenic, and phthalates make plastic soft and BPA makes plastic hard. You don't want either, okay. So when this came out that this was a bad thing, the manufacturer started selling things that say BPA-free. I'm sure you've seen that. The trick is that instead of BPA, they use BPS. Sneaky rats. And BPF. That's so sneaky. And these are chemicals, these are lookalikes, they're analogs, and they're just as harmful.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine and I'm wearing these red lens wind down Roa glasses because we are recording this late at night which is unusual for us and bright light in particular short wavelength bright light in the blue and green part of the spectrum quashes melatonin and it makes it hard to sleep and I want to sleep tonight these red lens glasses filter out the green and blue short wavelengths that would otherwise disrupt my sleep my guest today is Dr Ethan cross Dr Ethan cross is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and the director of the emotion and self-control laboratory he is also the author of the bestselling book chatter the voice in our head and how to harness it today's discussion is a really special one because we discuss something that each and all of us have which is a voice in our head that is our voice and that voice can range from encouraging to discouraging it can be repetitive in ways that can be very intrusive and it has a profound effect on our emotional state our confidence our levels of anxiety and indeed what we are capable of achieving in life Dr Ethan cross's laboratory has done groundbreaking research to understand what is the origin of this voice in our heads and can and should we control it and indeed the answer is yes today's discussion gets into many things that people struggle with and many things that you can do to improve your life such as how to regulate the chatter in your head how to overcome ruminations and intrusive thoughts and we also discuss what to do with your actual voice for instance data pointing to the fact that venting your negative emotions to others is actually bad it tends to amplify bad emotions we talk about that research we also talk about other forms of outward speech and inward speech that inner voice that you can partake in in order to improve your emotional state and shift your emotional state so today's discussion really centers around common questions and common scenarios and common challenges that everybody grapples with and of course we all have a voice in our head today you're going to learn to listen to it to regulate it and indeed to steer it in the direction of mental health physical health and performance I'm also excited to tell you that Dr Ethan cross soon has another book coming out entitled shift managing your emotions so they don't manage you and I tremendously enjoyed chatter his first book and I very much look forward to reading shift when it comes out we provide links to the work in Dr Ethan cross's laboratory as well as links to his previous and forthcoming book in the show note captions before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is expressvpn expressvpn is a virtual private Network that keeps your data secure and private it does that by routing your internet activity through their servers and encrypting it so that no one can see or sell your data now I'm personally familiar with the effects of not securing my data well enough several years ago I had one of my bank accounts hacked and it was a terrible amount of work to try and have that reversed and the account secured so after that happened I talked to my friends in the tech community and they told me that even though you may think your internet connection is secure often times it is not especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks such as those on planes in hotels at coffee shops and other public areas in fact even when you're on the internet at home your data may not be as secure as you think the great thing about expressvpn is that I don't even notice that it's running since the connection it provides is so fast I have it on my computer and on my phone and I just keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet if you want to start protecting your internet activity using expr VPN you can go to expressvpn.com huberman and you can get an extra

sleep tracking capacity one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep every single night is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay St deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely improve the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation pod cover

again that's 8sleep.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Ethan cross Dr Ethan cross welcome great to be here right before we went hot mics as they say uh we were talking about interrupting one another um and the fact that you're from New York I'm going to try not to interrupt you because the audience doesn't like that however I am very interested in what um you're going to tell us about emotion regulation but especially this thing that you call chatter the voice in our heads and prior to learning about your work I always thought that chatter and the voice in our heads was you know overwhelmingly negative that's what we hear how do you combat that negative voice in one's head but you have some very interesting ideas about the utility of chatter like maybe how it even arose and what it's for so maybe we start there yeah so I think this is a a great question because um the inner voice is something that we carry with us wherever go but we don't tend to learn what it is right and actually sometimes I I get up there and speak to people and um they often wonder like what is a purported serious scientist doing talking about a squishy topic like the voice inside our heads and it turns out that this is a remarkable tool of the human mind so when I use the term inner voice when I'm talking about is our ability to silently use language to reflect on things in our lives and it turns out that's a type of Swiss army knife that we possess it lets us do many different things so just from the outset let me distinguish chatter from other inner voice operations I think of chatter as a dark side of the inner voice and we'll get to that in a little bit but having the ability to silently use language that is a boon to The Human Condition so I'll give you a couple of benefits that it serves what's your favorite sport sports team um the Harlem Globe Trotters because they're undefeated as I understand oh yeah best record in in any sport I don't think they've ever lost a game did they ever play against other teams the the Washington generals okay sorry for the Washington generals um so if you were to go to a uh game and root for them what would you say um go Globe Trotters go Globe TRS okay can you repeat that phrase silently three times in your head right now yes okay you you've just used your inner voice so your inner voice is part of what we call our verbal working memory system basic system of the human mind that lets us do something that I think is both extraordinary but totally ordinary also your verbal working memory system it's a mouthful lets you keep information active for short periods of time so before we had cell phones how did you memorize phone numbers like what would you do repeated in your head yeah and it had sort of a song to it yeah right I can remember my childhood phone number still even though that number is long since long since gone I mean the whole area codee's gone in fact really well it the number is probably still there but under a different area code I know because I try calling it every once interesting well it's funny when I when I uh go through this content I give talks or workshops I often say 20951 repeat that in your head three times that's my childhood phone number I'm like go give it a shot give them a call so for all I know that person may be getting lots of phone calls it's not it's not my phone number um but that's your verbal working memory system you go to the grocery store and you try to remember what you supposed to get most people don't do that out loud like oh crap what was I supposed to get milk cheese eggs repeat that silently in your head so that's one thing your inner voice allows you to do keep information active verbal information your inner voice also helps you Sim and plan so before presentations or interviews a lot of people report going over what they're going to say before that event do you ever ever do this yeah I mean my mode of preparation for things like solo podcasts and talks is um it's not scripted out line by line in advance but I have a structure in my mind and it's more like remembering the first line of each paragraph in my head and then the rest just kind of falls out yeah we have a very similar similar style I will I will bullet out what the key ideas are and as long as I could bullet that out I am good to go but I will also rehearse those bullets in my head AB BC D so uh that's you using your inner voice as well now before a big presentation like a live event I will go over the opening to my presentation and sometimes just carry that dialogue through when I'm going for a walk around the hotel before the event may I ask about the walk um when I prepare for Live Events or solo podcasts and long before I was involved in either of those activities um for lectures of any kind or classroom discussions where I had to stand up in front of the class I would find that walking and listening to a song would maybe simultaneously maybe separately would dramatically shape the kind of cadence and energy of the delivery of the the talk yeah I love the fact that you brought up songs there so if you want to take a little detour here um so in in in my new book shift we talk about or I talk about how the different shifters that exist to push your emotions around and sensation sensory experiences are one powerful and I would argue often overlooked modality for shifting our emotions so if you ask people why do you listen to music what do you think most people say it makes me feel good feel right it's about emotions feel good so one study the the number was around like 95 96% of participants who were asked said exactly gave the answer that you just gave but then if you look at in other studies hey the last time you felt anxious or angry or sad what did you do to push your emotions around the number of people who report using music to modulate their experience drops way down 10 to 30% music is a a really powerful tool for modulating our emotions I actually um uh an unintentional parenting victory for me was when my youngest daughter was around five or six and I was coaching soccer I lived for these soccer games on the weekend I wasn't one of these overbearing coaches who would you know go crazy on the sidelines it was just such joy to just watch these these kids play and typically my daughter was was really excited to go to the game but one morning she was just like not into it at all she was bum like she was bummed out it was bumming me out I was you know catching her emotions we can talk about emotional contagion later and um got into the car and it just so happened that my my cell phone was connected and the next song on the playlist happened to be Journeys Don't Stop Believing so you know the song I presume uh don't judge me for having this on my playlist please the song comes on and you know I start jamming out to it you know singing out loud like an embarrassing dad and then I look in the back seat and I find her bopping her head and then the chorus comes we get really excited and then I pull up to the soccer field and she just bursts out of the car and is like invigorated that is the power of music to impact us so I will often also have songs on prior to Big talks that I'm I'm getting ready to you know get in that mental frame of mind and I don't think it's a coincidence that many athletes do this as well they've stumbled onto this tool that is quite powerful for pointing our emotional experience or our emotional trajectory in the direction we wanted to to point so it's interesting I I was thinking about music in reference to um shifting emotion as you just gave an example of you know feeling like a motivated and then your daughter's motivated by the yeah don't stop right yeah okay I'm not going to sing it going we'll do it together we not do that someone will cut the clip and they'll run it out they'll spool it out and then no I have a truly terrible singing voice but um I Wonder has the study ever been done or something similar to this where um people who are feeling pretty good or very good are exposed to sadder music and vice versa people are feeling sad exposed to um to sort of um ecstatic music or or positive lyrics um because I've often wondered whether or not humans like or dislike when things or people try and shift their state you I know in myself when you know I'm like feeling upset about something I don't want to feel upset I don't think anyone wants to feel upset but if I hear a song there's like that's positive there's there's a moment where I'm like I can feel it kind of pulling on me and you sort of know like I could follow that trajectory and probably get out of this and sometimes one does and sometimes one doesn't you know we're and this gets to I think a more fundamental issue which is why I'm asking uh which is are we supposed to feel our emotions as a way to you know sort of dissolve them when we don't want them kind of the cathartic approach or with listening to sad music when we're sad just amplify the sadness these are great questions and um I have a couple of they touch on a couple of amazingly important issues that we need to get into so let's just do them serially so number one has the the study been done where you expose people to different kinds of emot um music sad versus arousing you know happy music do you see that push people's emotions around yes in fact sensory tools like music or visual images are one of the most powerful tools that we have in our Arsenal for pushing people's emotions around in the context of experiments so we want to induce a particular kind of state we can play certain kinds of music or show people images that are designed to elicit positive or um negative emotional experiences so images being another sensory modality Vision so so that's number one number two there's this very interesting phenomenon where when we are in a particular emotional state let's say we're feeling sad we often don't reflex L seek out the happy music we don't go to Journey instead we go to Adele right we're going to Chicago I'm giving you my age bracket here right like the music that has sad associations for me so there's this mood congruency if I'm feeling a certain way I'm going to go deeper into that state and have the music facilitate me why on Earth would we do that are we all masochistic do we just want to feel even worse this gets at I think a critically important point that is not always talked about which is all emotions are functional when they're experiencing the right proportions not too intensely and not too long so sadness as an example is an emotion we experience when we've experienced some loss that we can't we can't Rectify right away like something has happened and you can't fix that so you've lost someone and so what does this emotion do well it it it hijacks the way we are thinking feeling and our bodies are responding so it motivates us to introspect to turn our attention inward to reflect on this situation to now try to make sense of it right something really important in my life has happen I now have to change the way I'm thinking about my life so I can find meaning and move on my physiology is slowing down so I can engage in that slow introspection but what's also really interesting about sadness is it's also impacting my facial display giving a sign to all of the people in my environment to say hey maybe we should check up on that person that guy cuz he looks like he's on his own in a corner right so can you detect when someone is sad if you see like a sad facial expression yes um when I used to teach these summer courses at Cold Spring Harbor in Northshore of Long Island that students would come in from all over the world and I've been there it's a great Sumer camp for scientist Al Laboratories all year and um my I eventually was director of a course there and my co-director and I used to have this um debrief at the end of the first day or two where we would talk to one another and we would you know go over the list of names and we'd say um and she was remarkably good at this just uh extraordinary like a superpower at saying you know I think everyone's settling in well but I noticed that so and so was kind of like might not be adjusted to the lag or might not be acclimating so well it's a very tight-knit group and the course is quite long for a course like that but it's important that everybody kind of feel engaged early on yeah um and people have a tendency to dominate in those intellectually you know competitive environments and and she could just pinpoint who it was that was feeling a little bit outside the group we knew how to amarate that really quickly and from her I learned a bit of how to recognize the signs and it was rarely um just facial expression included that and some other cues that she just seemed to have a unconscious or conscious genius around um so uh for me I learned some of that from her I like to think I got better at it but I think some people are are just extraordinarily good at that detection and it enhances social interactions and so some people are really good at detecting it others are really good at displaying it I'm going to go back to my my my daughter so you know if something happens where she feels sad she exhibits this exaggerated response like she'll stick out her lower lip and even if I'm kind of upset at her like it is amazing the power that that has on me I have over it is so so beautifully manipulative manipulative you know no man manipulative and um it it's it's a testament to the power that these displays can have on us so I want to go back to one other um question you raised in your last comment and we'll go back to the inner voice and its functionality um you raised the question about being shifted by others other people and perhaps either just our surroundings music or spaces sometimes you don't want to have your emotions be shifted and in fact when other people try to do that it can elicit what we call reactants like you get defensive because I don't want you pushing me in the particular direction I think that's a really important point that we need to be aware of as people living and working in these social environments where we're often well-intentioned but sometimes our well-intentioned behaviors can backfire and so there's this this beautiful research which shows that if you see someone suffering and you volunteer to help them and they haven't asked you to help them that can blow up in your face because that what a does is it often communicates to people that you are thinking that they're not capable of handling their own circumstances and most of us like we're motivated to think that we're capable of handling ourselves and so there are still ways you can help people in those circumstances it's called providing invisible support which involves providing support to the person who can genuinely benefit from it but not shining a spotlight on the fact that that is what you are doing so how might this transpire there's some really simple things you could do so let's say my wife is um really overwhelmed with stuff and she hasn't asked me for help but I know she is at her Wits End work and kids and other kinds of stuff that are on her plate I can I can proactively do things to lessen her burden if it's her turn to pick up the dry cleaning and the groceries I'm doing that voluntarily I'm I'm doing that and I'm not coming home and saying hey sweetie look what I did today I did all these things you know can I have a pad on my back that's not what we're talking about it's about your group your your your lab is working under a deadline right to submit a Grant application and they don't have time to eat and you proactively have pizza delivered to the lab it's those little things that can help give you two more examples let's say that um someone on your team is really struggling with their their ability to translate their work for for popular audiences and that's something they're motivated to do really important skill for scientist to be able to translate what they do for others to consume before you pull them aside and say Hey you know I notice that you're stumbling on a few different issues and here are a couple of things I think you can do better before you do that direct intervention you might have a team meeting where you share out best practices hey what are the two things that I've learned that really have benefited my ability to communicate with different audiences what you're doing there is you're getting people the the resources they can benefit from but you're not shining a spotlight on the fact that you are directing it to them so it's kind of a back doorway of of helping or of Shifting the last uh the last tool I'll mention brings it back to sensation one of the most powerful ways we can shift other people is is through touch tactile sensation um you know what's the first thing that you do with a child to suo them when they are born hold them hold them skin- to- skinin contact I remember uh both times my my kids were born it was like you know I want to get in on that like you know cuz my wife got first first dibs with with both of our daughters like I want some of that you know skin- to- skinin contact uh that doesn't end after we leave the womb the the comfort that we experience the release of stress fighting chemicals that occurs when affectionate Embraces are registered uh that continues throughout the lifespan so if my daughters who don't particularly like Dad to volunteer advice to them on most things nowadays uh if I know they're having a bad day like I'll go over and you know I'll rub their back in a totally UNC creepy way that is an important caveat we should give to everyone who's listening what we're talking about here is affectionate but not creepy or unwanted touch it is touch that is mutually desired and there is some research which shows actually that when it is not desired you don't get these benefits and in fact you get the opposite Plus usually like lawsuits as well yeah sure no I I um I definitely believe that as a primate species which we are we are old Old World primates um I think they call it allopathic grooming like you'll see these images of these monkeys and lots of different species of of primates um you know just sitting nearby one another where one just has its even just its um I said its hand yes it's PAW it's hand it's PAW on the on the one next to it and they'll just sit like that for long periods of time yeah and then sometimes they're doing like an active grooming of of removing you know parasite this is very important in in uh primate world uh as we know but you know grooming and and and you know picking and these kinds of things you see it in couples it's actually can be kind of endearing I suppose at its extremes it's kind of gross but you know it's it's rather endearing to see um somebody kind like remove a piece of lint off somebody somebody you know their partner's uh jacket or you know just or even just touch that is it's not doesn't look like it's geared towards any specific outcome yeah right it's uh and it doesn't necessarily appear romantic or that it's grooming so maybe the lint example isn't the best one but where you just see people that are just like actually on the flight down this morning cuz I had to fly in early it was I was sitting on the aisle seat in the middle was a a boy he was probably 14 15 and his mom was at the window seat and I went up to uh to use the restroom came back and he had fallen asleep on his mom's shoulder and I I took a look it was a very endearing moment and then when we landed I said you know the ability to sleep anywhere as a superpower and he said I I learned it from my dad he said and it was a moment where I just thought it was just a very pleasant thing to see them in this touch on on the plane he clearly felt comfortable enough to do that remember thinking like yeah humans were a lot like the we're a lot like the other primates yeah there's there's a beauty to it and you know it is it is a tool it is one kind of shifter that has to be obviously used in the appropriate context all of our sensory modalities are powerful tools for I would argue relatively effortlessly shifting our emotions and I think that's really important because people often think that regulating our emotions is hard work to the extent that they believe you can regulate your emotions at all we'll talk about that in a little bit too I'm sure but but it all you know self-control emotion regulation like let me like roll up my sleeves and really kind of get in there yes it can at times be extraordinarily difficult to manage our emotions and some of the tools that we have are effortful one example would be expressive writing this wonderful tool for working through problematic experiences you sit down just let yourself go for 15 to 20 minutes a day for 1 to 3 days this is the penny Baker this is the penny Baker writing effect this is this is a a just a remarkably wonderful um side effect free You could argue intervention for helping you deal with curveballs that life throws at you you vast amounts of data supporting the practice you vast amounts of data Benny Baker really deserves in my opinion uh if not a the psychology equivalent of a Nobel Prize I don't know what that is but um it deserves real deep praise for um developing that method because it's essentially zero cost takes a little bit of time and there's just what hundreds of studies hundreds of studies showing that these 15 10 to 15 minute cathartic writing just free associate writing usually with as I understand with a with a writing better um we did an episode where I I talked about this and and received a note from um from him and um was grateful that we didn't get anything badly wrong in fact he was pleased with it I think that um he deserves a lot of credit we a powerful tool for selfhealing we actually just re um restarted a a prestigious speaker series at Michigan the cats newcome speaker series which is um designed to honor luminaries in the field and we actually kicked it off with Jamie coming to speak about his extraordinary work um because this is really a gift I think not just to the field but humanity and the butt though here is that it's an effortful tool it takes 15 minutes to use there is nothing wrong with that lots of things that we do in life are effortful but we also know that we don't like exerting effort as a species we like to conserve our resour sources as much as possible so if there are easy things you could do as well it's good to know about what those are and these sensory shifters music um you know looking at images right these are modality taste touch these are ways of pushing your emotions around pretty effectively for short periods of time that in a pinch like when your your daughter's not in a great mood or when you want to get pumped up before an important event can be useful and we often just go through our lives not recognizing how we can strategically harness them so that's my plug for uh for s for sensory shifters I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that includes prebiotics and adaptogens I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing at a time when my budget was really Limited in fact I only had enough money to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat Whole Foods and unprocessed Foods it's very difficult to get in a vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from diet alone in order to make sure that I'm at my best meaning have enough energy for all the activities I participate in from morning until night sleeping well at night and keeping my immune system strong when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health my performance recovery from exercise all of those improve and I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take my ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome in the brain that when I regularly take ag1 that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go

emphasized on this podcast is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improv skin health and wound healing improvements in acne reduced pain and inflammation improved mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself now what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning they use specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations personally I use the ju whole body panel about 3 to four times a week and I use the juv handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try ju you can go to juv spelled jv.com huberman juv is offering Black Friday discounts of up to $1,300 now through December 2nd 2024 again that's ju jv.com huberman to get up to $1,300 off select ju products let's go back to um just close the loop on the inner voice and the benefits that it provides so we talked about two verbal working memory right keeping in verbal information active for short periods of time and we talked about simulating and planning things like going over what you're going to say before an interview or um an important presentation let's turn to self-control and motivation so you exercise can you've talked about exercising no I I try to exercise um six days a week although some are short workout some are longer yeah you ever talk to yourself when you exercise oh all the time so let's hear it the world wants to know Andrew what do you say to yourself on your exercise depends on how well rested I am how motivated I am um I'll give two examples at the opposite poles of uh the motivational scale I was traveling two weeks ago and I um was doing some exercises for that there's a muscle on the back of the shoulder the rear deltoid it's um I don't think anyone's favorite muscle to train but it's a very important one that's when you do this one you're right for shoulder posture and stability and got to train those uh that muscle group because otherwise people tend to get this inward rotating like you know thumbs pointing toward belly button and shoulders rolling forward thing and there are a number of reasons why it's important so you got to do the rear delt thing and I sat down to do the first work set after a couple warm-ups and I remember thinking like I love training I love training I have since I started training when I was 16 and I thought to myself for some reason I don't want to do this this morning and then I thought okay David gogins would probably start swearing at himself in his head so I started that a little bit and that didn't really work for me sorry David um and then I thought I'm going to go through every possible inner voice I can think of so I heard Joo willing voice I'm friends with Joo and her just saying like yeah whatever you're just weak you know or just uh like do it anyway kind of mentality and I just started cycling through all all of them and I made a deal with myself that when I ran out of voices to use that's when I would stop the set and I probably tripled the number of repetitions that I would normally get with that weight so it was it was like one part motivation one part distraction one part frustration and I was just pulling from the um catalog of possible voices of um kind of Coach like voices and uh it worked out pretty well yeah and then then at the Other Extreme I can recall many times because I put effort into it where I'm well rested I'm hydrated get appropriate amounts of caffeine in my system which I love and sit down to train and I absolutely love to train under those conditions the sun is shining music's playing and I just remember this was during a set this was a leg day always the hardest day set of heavy hack squats and just thinking I love this but I have this inner voice where every time I I start a repetition I go through thing where I brace my midsection so I don't hurt my back and I always look directly at the ceiling and I think about my Bulldog Costello and I think I'm gonna do this one for you I'm gonna do this one for you and I know at those moments my inner voice goes to he would probably just be sitting there like why are you working this hard Bulldogs don't like to work um so I I'm not really in a complete sentence generation inner voice kind of thing um but you have a very rich inner world right you are you're you know um verbal working memory stream is filled with with words when you are working out yeah and I'll tell you this I was going to ask you this later in the episode but um maybe it's relevant now I think it is when I was a kid after my parents would tuck me in to go to sleep at night I used to lie in bed and rehearse voices that I had heard throughout the day and I felt like I could hear them in their tone of voice and then I'd make them say different things just for my own entertainment so could have them say whatever I wanted but in a particular voice and um my friend sometimes teas me that I'll give people voices like I'll give someone like a Marge Simpson Voice or something I'll just they're like she doesn't sound like that at all but I'll just sort of create a narrative in my mind so yeah lot of lot of um chatter in there a lot of lot of voices yeah but not super organized it's not like I'm constructing a play it's just kind of you know it feels like things geys are up I you know I toour with them maybe and then but it's kind of a mish mash it's not super regimented these aren't complete sentences well you know one of the reasons why the penny Baker effect is believed to be so useful is because it imposes a structure on the stream going through our head which is often times not organized and when you find that inner verbal stream going in the negative Direction so negative selft talk so the chatter right you're an idiot such an idiot or you're looping over a problem without making any progress putting those words in you know actually taking that inner stream and and making a story out of it is essentially what the penny Baker writing cues you to do because we are taught when we write we write in sentences there's a structure to our writing that we impose on our thinking up here in our minds it's a free-for-all it can go in all sorts of directions and that chaos is in part what can make chatter so aversive so glad you're bringing this up our very first guest ever on this podcast was a guy named Carl dth bioengineer he's a practicing psychiatrist he's one of The Luminaries of Neuroscience he developed these um light sensitive uh channels to be able to manipulate neurons in animal models but also now in human clinical work as well and one thing that he shared was that after he puts his kids to sleep I think now they're grown but um in the evening he'll sit deliberately sit still completely bodily still close his eyes and force himself to think in complete sentences for maybe an hour or so maybe more and I thought to myself wow like that that's a very disciplined practice it also speaks to what you're saying which is that typically thinking in complete sentences is not the default the mind so I don't know what his specific reason for doing that is he shared a few of them on that uh podcast episode but I'm sure there are others as well uh but I tried it it's very difficult to especially with eyes closed to not drift into multiple narratives kind of that the stream sort of split into your tributaries and then you know it sort of you dissolve into sleep or meditation experience almost dream likee state where you're you know these Lial States well that's I think where the writing provides a tool to structure your thinking talking is is a has a similar modality so when we talk to people there is a structure to the way way we converse where we're not if I were to just talk to you the way I pinball in my mind you wouldn't be able to understand me and you would think I'm out of my bleeping mind right because I would be unable to have a a meaningful conversation with you so there's some research which shows that if you get people to think of um to recall a chatter provoking experience so think about something negative that's happened to you and then you randomly assign them to just think about it work it through in their mind versus write about it so I.E a penny Baker writing like condition or talk about it to someone else the talking and the writing both do better in terms of how they feel when they're done as compared to the just thinking because there's no guard rails to the way we think that we are taught I should add because we're going to give people guard rails later in this episode so in addition to using the penny Baker approach and by the way we'll provide link to some um resources for the penny Baker journaling because there's some free online resources that I think are really powerful for people to use if they want to use that as a template um for cathartic reasons or just you know get one's mind around a problem or something I'm very familiar with waking up and just feeling like everything is kind of not a storm in there but a a bit too disorganized to um to get my head right you know and so I need things to get my head right sometimes it's music sometimes it's writing I sounds like journaling is just a really useful prce practice overall um it's a it's a useful practice and it's an underutilized practice so we did um two pretty large studies during Co to look at how people how are people regulating their emotions on a daily basis to deal with the anxiety surrounding Co and we gave them a series of tools that they could check off if they use the tools that day and we learned a couple of really interesting things uh number one there are no one size fits-all solutions for folks so remarkable variability characterized the tools that work for person a versus person B uh number two it was seldom the case that people used one tool in general people used on average three or four tools each day which I think is another really important take-home because I am often asked as for example what is my favorite tool for managing emotions I don't have a favorite tool because I'm typically using multiple tools and most people are doing exactly the same so it's it's kind of like what we're learning about emotion regulation is in some ways it's it's similar to physical exercise you you're not only going to work out your rear deltoids with the same exercise every day you would have like funky looking shoulders if you did right and you'd probably be pretty weak in lots of other parts of your body you're doing multiple things and the multiple things that you do to exercise I'm guessing are different from the multiple things that I do to exercise yet we we may well be equally fit well you may be a little bit more fit than me but I doubt it you get you get the drift so there's this beautiful uh variability to how we manage our inner worlds to bring it back to expressive writing we found that expressive writing when people used it was really really useful it moved the needle on their Co anxiety but it was an underutilized tool people didn't do it very much and I think that's in part because it is somewhat effortful I want to ask another question about movement that falls on the other end of the spectrum to what we're talking about now which is structuring one's thoughts in the form of writing in order to parse an idea or work through an emotional state in 2015 I by the way I use these anecdotes not because um I want to focus on me but just as generalizable anecdotes okay the specifics here don't matter but I think probably most people are familiar with having an important decision where they have to weigh um you know path a versus path B and I was in that place I was I was actually choosing between a job at one one institution another institution Each of which had tremendous advantages neither had any you know like striking disadvantages but it was a really hard decision and those close to me at that time will tell you that it was just brutal been there yeah I made everybody around me suffer tremendously to the point where people are just like flip a coin now I'm not an indecisive person I think um you know it's one of these things where big decisions I think deserve a time and attention and and it was a time constraint thing so I was pouring over this procons list I was watching YouTube videos trying to figure out best ways for decision making I was trying to I actually um isn't isn't it amazing by the way when we're in those situations and I know exactly what you're talking about because I was pretty sure I was in exactly the same position the things you do in those circumstances to get some insight are are wacky like I'm sure you were Googling things that you had no business Googling these kinds of decision trees and I mean it turns out they mathematical models that um like there's the the the um actually my colleague at uh NYU Tony mavin I forget the name of the model but there's a model about how many um towns you should evaluate it's an old kind of old example of towns you should um evaluate in terms of where to start a business like is it two is it three and and there's an optimal strategy there in any event most of it wasn't helping I do believe that at some point you don't want too many committee members because it just gets confusing so the the two best pieces of of information came from the following practices one was a colleague said forget all the superficial proon stuff and I actually think this is proved to be very useful in all domains of life for me he said take yourself through a typical weekday in one place versus the other wake up where you going to go how are you going to travel take yourself through the practicals of the day because because everything else Falls away once you're at a place or you're in a type of relationship take yourself through a given day don't think about the relationship or the institution that you're going to work for the school you're going to go to that's important but take yourself through the entire day so I did that and then he said also do it on a weekend because you know well in our profession uh we tend to work all the time but occasionally you take a day off and so that was very useful the other thing that was very useful which was completely surprising to me was at that time um I was training in a boxing gym and I was doing some speed bag work and decent at it you know you get into a rhythm and and what's so great about speed bag work is that you get into a rhythm where you forget that you're trying to do the movement in a particular way these um Central pattern generators as we call them in Neuroscience take over and you're just kind of you know turning your hands over and away and you're like every once a while you can think okay you need to put a little more hip swivel into this or a little more head movement and practice my slips or something but it's largely unconscious after a certain point and I was doing that and all of a sudden boom a thought just geyser to the surface and I made my decision and that was my final decision yeah and I never went back from that decision and so it was in the act of not trying to parse things through words that words sprung up from my whatever unconscious somewhere in my brain cortical or something cortical I don't know and it was like that's it and and I I I was overwhelmed by that and again I don't share all that because I I think it's speed bags or it's the example I gave before that's going to solve it for everybody but that that these answers to hard problems seem to come from very diametrically opposed approaches verbal construction of complete sentences with paper or deliberately like daero does and then also like not trying to get an answer at all Boom the answer shows up what in the world is that so it speaks to this idea that first of all there are no one fits all solutions to addressing many of the big kinds of problems and decisions we have to face so there are different modalities to self-discovery and insight and yes you can think very rationally and work it through and write about it and have conversations with other people and then you can also allow your unconscious problem solving Machinery to to do its thing we don't understand completely how this works but we do know that your experience is not infrequent many people report having moments of insight when they are when they are not otherwise engaged and and you know one line of thinking is that we are doing problem solving behind the scenes that we're not aware of and the and the solutions are bubbling up to awareness so I actually this may be the wrong usage of terms but I weaponize this process for myself so uh before I exercise before I get on the treadmill or or row or do whatever I'm going to do I will load up the particular issue that I'm trying to find a solution for sometimes it's how to word a a paragraph it might be if I'm working on a book how to find the right kind of story if it's a uh an interpersonal issue that I've got to smooth over I load that up and then I just get on the device it's usually an aerobic exercise that I'm doing and I just I just I don't really hard think about it in any fixed way but inevitably the ideas the potential Solutions bubble up into awareness that is a real valuable tool that I possess that I think allows me to to have success in various areas of my life it also identifies one of the reasons why chatter can be so unbelievably pernicious so we didn't get to all the benefits of the there's one more benefit of the inner voice that I want to get to but I'm going to take a detour here for a second CU I think this is really important if we think of chatter as the dark side of your inner voice you're basically continuing to Loop over the same problem in your head without making any progress what if this happens why did this happen I'm such a imbecile you're just continually going over that negative phenomenon or experience you're not making any any Headway one of the things that that does is it consumes our our attentional resources it acts like a sponge that soaks up those limited resources and so what that means is when I get on the treadmill or rowing machine and that's typically the time that I spend innovating right coming up with solutions that allow me to progress personally and professionally I don't have my mind's not working to solve those problems instead it is stuck dealing with this other muck where I'm not getting it anywhere and and so we actually see if you look at the literature that one of the ways that chatter undermines people is it interferes with their ability to to focus and solve problems and that's a that's just one way it undermines people but that is a huge huge liability is there an association between trauma and elevated levels of internal chatter uh I would say even more than an association so we often think of chatter as uh what we called is a a trans diagnostic mechanism so it's a mouthful that predicts various kinds of mood disorders so what that means is Chatter refers to a process a process of looping turning the same material over and over in your head the content of that looping can take many different forms you could inject some sad cognitions in there I'm a such a is it okay to say should I say sure people I mean David Goggins was on this podcast yeah I mean pretty much anything goes typically we don't swear at each other but I'm pretty thick skinned if you need to you know I've been called way worse than anything youve been boxing I I actually boxed in high school I don't recommend people box unless they're you know they're professional and even then I mean I must say as a neuroscientist it's a lot of fun yeah and on W Wednesday nights I'd Spar a little bit but I will say this it's um there are other sports where you can go level 10 out of 10 yeah more safely much more safely for the brain like Brazilian jiu-jitsu and things like that you know where you techically don't want to insult the brain yeah I I as a neuroscientist I can't encourage people to Bo I I I I would agree um in any case uh I promise not to LEAP across the table if you do the same fair enough deal Fair Deal um so basically chatter refers to this this process of looping over and over if you inject some sad cognitions in there I'm an imbecile how can I you know I'm never going to live up to to my potential I don't belong here like so then you get if you take that to an extreme high intensity and you perseverate over time then you're getting towards depression if you inject anxiety provoking cognitions oh my God what if this happens and what if that happens and you go down that path of uncertainty and and fear well that leads you to more of the anxious route and if you are are filling that loop with traumatic memories and reminders of really painful experiences you can get pushed towards trauma too so it is a it is a process that cuts across many different really serious conditions that we grapple with in society but I want I want to also be clear to to folks who are listening that if you experience chatter that does not mean you have any of those disorders If you experience chatter Welcome to The Human Condition my friends because most of us do at times and so we often don't experience it as intensely or for long stretches of time which tends to characterize some of those clinical groups I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my IM immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from talk doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because i' had been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetyl cysteine both of which can support glutathion production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently join their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function if you had to hire light for now and we'll get back to others in a moment the best maybe one or two ways to combat chatter yeah what would those be well that's um let me tell you about a couple of things that I do personally because like so like as we we try to regulate lots of different emotional experiences different tools work for different people and different situations there are you know upwards of two dozen or more science-based tools that that I that I covered when I wrote chatter when I got into shift the broader train of regulating your emotions there are even more tools out there so I don't want to presume that the tools that work for me are going to work for everyone uh my my first line of defense when it comes to chatter are two distancing tools so when I'm using the term distancing what I'm talking about is not avoidance per se we should talk about avoidance later but what I'm talking about when I say dist ing is the ability to step back and view myself from a uh a slightly more objective perspective and it turns out there are many different tactics that exist for doing this one tactic that I find very powerful is is language so I can manipulate the words I use to refer to myself so I will often use my name and the second person pronoun you to try to think through a problem Ethan how are you going to manage this situation if you think about when use words like you they are the verbal equivalent of pointing a finger at someone else and what when you use your name and you to work through a problem it's automatically switching your perspective it's getting you to relate to yourself like like you're giving advice to someone else and it turns out that's a really powerful tool because one of the things we know about human beings is we are much better at giving advice to others than we are taking that advice ourselves have you ever experienced this Andrew gosh no yes of course absolutely I mean our our Optics are just much clearer when we're um in observation than when we're internally unless I find um that I dedicate some real minutes or hours basically a sort of meditation not unlike the complete sentence construction exploration that we were talking about before just going Inward and really saying okay let's let's have a conversation about this true and having a conversation with myself in there and that always leads to an obvious truth yeah or sometimes a decision node that isn't clear to me yet but it leads some place that feels like forward yeah um but you're taking Special Steps to be able to to to align yourself with the advice that you would give to someone else like reflexively sometimes we stumble right oh absolutely I mean I and and the number of different ways that we can distract ourselves this is what I was going to ask in a few moments but I'll take the opportunity now I I am wondering as we're talking about this today if one of the more powerful hooks of social media is the scroll aspect that with essentially zero effort we can pick up a device and scroll through images and movies and it it will update us according to update the uh the imag and topics of course according to what it senses as our dwell times on certain pages and all of a sudden we don't have to think about what's in our head yeah uh my dad used to refer to um surfing the internet because at that time it was that and scrolling social media as kind of a a cognitive chewing gum it keeps us busy but it doesn't provide any real nutrition well you know it's interesting if you go back to um when Facebook first came on the scene one of the early prompts that it would use to get people to contribute textual information to do you remember what this was what is on your mind so you would be cued to share what is on your mind and you know it in in some ways you could think of various forms of social media as providing people with a giant megaphone for their inner voice right is literally asking you or it did what is on your mind right now so that's in terms of posting like what's on your mind but in terms of consuming information which I think most people on social media seem to be consumers more than creators um I mean it's remarkable to me how I can you know pick up the phone and I have a specific phone with Instagram and x on it and it's those apps are not on any other phones so that it's segregated from yeah if somebody sends me a tweet or sends me an Instagram post on I'm not going to I'm not going to open it I can't open it on those phones right and that's helped a lot we should come back to that because that's also modifying your your spaces which is another tool that I think is underutilized so we should talk about that too we'll definitely um touch on that what I find is I'll say okay I'm going to take six minutes at six minutes till the hour take six minutes this and what's incredible is how fast six minutes seems to go by that's what's so striking it's it's remarkable and not always bad so we often talk about social media like it is a de facto harm to society there are negative features of social media that are well documented uh there are also some I would argue Redemptive qualities to it uh I'll give you one of my my personal ones which is you know sometimes like to unwind before bed I'm thinking all day I want to just watch some ridiculously funny short reels yeah raccoon videos yeah I mean you know my wife looks over at me she's like what are you laughing at and then I sometimes I show her and she goes why are you laughing at that right so but but you know the algorithm has learned the specific kinds of funny videos that I like and know I'm not going to tell you what they are and it it it it just lightens the load and so that's a way that I'm using social media very strategically to shift my emotions in a Direction I want them to be shifted at a certain time I think when we talk about social media and our our emotional lives the real challenge we face is how to learn how to navigate these new digital environments in ways that serve us rather than serve against us and undermine our goals we we we basically got thrown into social media without any rule book yeah we're the experiment we're the experiment and but if you think about it's a it's a new environment we were born into this physical world and our our parents our caretakers from the time we are able to understand things and probably before they are teaching us they're social I izing us how to navigate this space profitably they don't just like Lord of the Flies throw us into the world and let us let us kind of figure it out outcomes wouldn't be likely as good as they are for us if we didn't have the kind of instruction that we receive and we're only now developing that knowledge base to understand hey here are the healthy versus harmful versus benign ways of navigating social media and I'm talking about social media now like it's this unitary environment different social media applications of course have their own norms and rules of the games you could think of them as like little different countries they have their own little micr cultures that you want to learn how to navigate and scientists are really busy trying to understand how they function But It's Tricky and It's tricky because creators can change how these applications govern by a press of a button right you could change the way the algorithm works and then you've got to start over to some extent I've been told that by people in my life that one of the main reasons they get onto their phone in the middle of the night if they happen to wake up is that it allows a very um soothing distraction compared to trying to wrestle with the you know fire hose of thoughts in their head yeah and that yeah it's kind of like the way you describe these funny videos that you won't disclose to us that sounds like um you know they typically involve pranks oh okay noted um we used to hear um that people um you know would have a drink after work to just kind of like you know take the edge off or something like that I feel like social media is doing that for a lot of people yeah the way you describe it fits with that idea and that I I certainly believe that from everything we know about the Circadian Health literature that you want to avoid looking at your phone um between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. most nights nobody's perect but that if you wake up in the middle of the night one of the worst things you can do is get on your phone and start scrolling social media but I'm guessing people do it because it feels even worse to just sit there with your thoughts in the dark it's a shifter but this is a perfect um segue back to you know you asked me about the tools that you recommend for fighting chatter and I'm telling you about the ones I use so there's a second tool that I will use automatically when I I detect the chatter brewing and I call it my 2 a. chatter strategy and I call it my 2 a.m. chatter strategy because every I seemingly like four to 6 weeks I will go to bed happy and content and then I'll wake up at 2: a.m. and like it is all going to hell really fast what time do you typically go to sleep uh usually around 11 11:30 interesting yeah this is a common problem for a lot of people and there are some tools like long exhale breathing and things that that clearly work I I long ago made a ision I refuse to believe any thought that occurs between the hours of 2: a.m. and 5: a.m. I just refuse I don't believe it it's it's as if somebody's lying to me in my head yeah and one could argue well maybe that's where the truth is coming out because your forebrain is not so good at suppressing these you know unconscious uh thoughts and sure all good but as you point out they are rarely the kind of thoughts that one can work with positive or negative so the tool that I use actually um implicitly activates an idea like the one you are describing so at 2 a.m. when the chatter strikes and by the way you say like this is common this is more than common when I present to audiences and you know thousands and thousands of people over over the years and I ask hey you ever you ever get 2 a.m. chatter maybe 2:30 a.m. all the hands go up this is a I don't want to say Universal Affliction but it is an incredibly common problem that people struggle with like the chatter at night so what I do is I use something called mental time travel mental time travel into the future and what I do is I I ask myself and I typically use my own name to do it so I'm blending another distancing tool distance selft talk I said Ethan how are you going to feel about this tomorrow morning no matter how bad the chatter ever is at 2 a.m. to your point when I wake up the next morning and my my brain is fully fully awake and I have access to my my prefrontal C text and I could think constructively about things it is never as bad that next morning as it is in the middle of the night we of course have learned that over time because how many how many mornings have we woken up in our lives we could do the math if I was more sophisticated I'd do it on the flight I can't right but like many many mornings we have experienc this like chatter at 2: a.m. at 7:00 a.m. not so bad so when you jump into this mental time travel machine and you ask yourself how am I going to feel about this tomorrow morning next week next year 10 years from now what that does is it activates this understanding that what you are going through as bad as it may seem it is temporary it will eventually subside and that does something very powerful for a mind that is consumed with chatter it turns the volume down on it which for me is often all I have to do to get back to bed so the official name for this tool is not mental time travel it is called called temporal distancing and it's a flexible tool you can you can ask yourself if you're struggling with a problem how you're going to feel about it tomorrow next week 10 years from now and it's another way of of broadening your perspective it's another kind of distancing tool that has a lot of science behind it so those are the those are two the two of the cognitive things that I do on my own and that nips a significant chunk of the chatter that I experien in the bud when it happens and I should add that because I know about what chatter is and I know about how these tools work I am exceptionally strategic in utilizing those tools the moment I detect the chatter Brewing so people will often ask hey do you ever um do you ever experienced chatter like yeah of course pinch me I'm a living breathing human being I do at times but I'm really good at detecting it and then implementing Tools in an almost automatic manner if this happen s if the chatter strikes then I'm going to coach myself through the problem using my own am andu and I'm going to jump into the mental time travel machine and ask myself how am I going to feel about this in the future if that's not sufficient then I'll go to like the level two response which consists of if weather permits I'll go for a walk in a in a safe natural setting I always feel the the the need to give the caveat about safe and natural because where I grow grew up in Brooklyn like the the natural settings were the place you you got mugged so they were not safe but you know a park I I find restorative and there's a ton of work highlighting the restorative features of green spaces but then what I'll also do is I will um I'll I'll I'll dial up the the chatter Advisory board so I have a couple of people that I have carefully thought about what these people do for me when I have a problem and they importantly don't just let me vent my emotions or or cathect to use that term before just I don't just get it out a lot of people think that the key to feeling better is to venture emotions there's research on this venting is good for strengthening bonds between people it's good to know that you know we're buddies now I could call you up if I'm struggling you're going to listen to me and empathize with me that's great for our relationship but if all you do is just validate what I'm going through and you don't take the next step to additionally help me look at that bigger picture and problem solve I leave the conversation feeling really good about my relationship with you but the problem is still there so just venting ends up leading to what we call co- rumination which can be pretty harmful the people on my chatter Advisory Board they know to First validate empathize with me learn about what I'm going through they've got my back they communicate that powerfully but then once they do that they start working with me to broaden the perspective to try to think through that problem which I'm having difficulty doing sometimes when the chatter is really really loud and you know typically when I get to that stage um I'm in pretty good shape I love your examples of how you deal with chatter your example of going to sleep and the reason I asked when you go to sleep at about 11: p.m. and waking up at 2:00 or 3: and that being a very common issue is as far as I understand reflective of the fact that early in the night our sleep is dominated by slow wave deep sleep with less rapid eye movement sleep and then somewhere right about that transition time it's not necessarily 2 or 3 a.m. per se but given that you asleep for about 3 4 hours after about 3 4 hours of sleep the proportion of our sleep that is rapid eye movement sleep relative to deep slow wave sleep shifts dramatically the intensity of our dreams shifts dramatically they become more emotionally Laden and that whole process of having those rapid eye movement um sleep Associated dreams is strongly associated with the removal of an emotional load in the morning when we wake we know this because if you selectively deprive people of early night versus late night sleep and so on the reason I mentioned this is that um one tool that I certainly have found useful is that well two tools really if people just understand that one of the reasons they'll wake up Suddenly at 2 or 3: a.m. is that they're undergoing this transition from a one kind of one form of sleep to another it's almost like a different Beast altogether and that heart racing emotionally lateen thoughts is characteristic of where they're supposed to be in the Sleep architecture cycle and so for me so that's that's um number one the other is that um the tool that you provided of of getting into this mental time travel I I'd like to just double click on this um notion of time perception in sleep and dreaming I mean time is very fluid you can be one environment than another it seems compressed a lot happens in a short amount of time when we are in chatter in the daytime to what extent does it alter our perception of time um and I have a very specific reason for asking this because I believe that one of the main uh got of unifying features among the tools for dealing with depression anxiety Etc When I Survey the research is almost all of them journaling meditation even some of the medications for that matter involve taking people into a different sort of um time perception mode and it's a kind of an abstract idea but I I think um this this may resonate with some of the issues related to chatter that when we're in a mental frame That's not healthy for where we want to be at that moment awake when we need to sleep you know anxious when we want to be calm and so forth that changing our time perception seems to be the most useful thing that we can do or at least among the most useful so what's the relationship between chatter and time perception and tell tell me more about what you mean by time per ception uh uh how broadly or finely we are binning time so we know that as autonomic arousal let's call it stress but wakefulness and autonomic arousal goes up we're F slicing time in fact the pupils get bigger we actually see you know depth of field changes we get higher resolution image of much less this is it makes every bit of evolutionary sense you know we can deal with fewer things better yeah and typically it's the thing that we're fixated or ruminating on when we're relaxed think about like sitting back on a beach and you're watching the clouds go by it's almost like you're rate yeah is slower so your you know higher frame rate is like slow motion this is why people who experience trauma often feel like things are or a car crash like see it in slow motion it's not in slow motion you're fine slicing time yeah it's kind of a remarkable thing right this is also how athletes learn to play with their levels of autonomic arousal Fighters can see punches coming in at it's almost like slow motion but they can react with full speed likewise with tennis players will describe this so what we're talking about is dynamically changing the frame rate of one's experience yeah it's a very interesting question and there's not much data that I'm aware of directly linking chatter with these um with time perception and the way you're describing it but what does come to mind are are experiences of flow which in many ways you might you might consider the opposite of chatter flow being this state where um you know you're just in the moment and and and time is effortlessly passing your the demands of the situation completely match the skills that you bring to bear it almost seems like the antithesis of what you're describing when I think about time in chatter what what I becomes most accessible for me is this tendency that we have to really zoom in very narrowly on the object of the chatter on the thing that is causing that distress and we focus you know so narrowly on it which of course makes a great deal of sense because what are we taught to do from the time we're little kids when we have a problem think about it share it yeah there you go you got it on try number one zoom in focus on the problem roll up your sleeves and get to the bottom of it and so that's that kind of really you're getting in there in fine grain detail and um you know some that does work for us a lot of the time but turns out when you inject a lot of emotion into the equation that can get really troubling and that's where this zooming out taking this broader view whether you do that through Visual modalities IM ination modalities like mental time travel you could time travel into the future like I've just described you can also go back in time like I do this quite a bit when I'm struggling with some kind of adversity I will go back in time and think of another experience in my life or someone else's life that I I know of when times were even worse and they got through it and oh if I got through that well sure as heck I can get through this and so that's expanding our perception of time are are are looking at that bigger picture to work through something in the present moment how often do you think people and I do believe this is related to chatter but if it's not we can set this aside uh for another day uh how often do you think people are in kind of negative or positive fantasy like as they move through their day I'm sure a study has been done asking people what they're thinking about I me how often is it actually tied to what they're doing or they're supposed to be doing or are they think about like what they're going to do this weekend or maybe even constructing entire narratives of things that are like non-existent that they would like to exist or you know occasionally we'll see this person I think we've all seen this person kind of mumbling to themselves and it doesn't look like they're mumbling Pleasant things that's because they've just been rejected by a journal editor their article the experience of every scientist um and it's of course always reviewer number two's fault they didn't read the paper carefully enough of course and none of us have ever been reviewer number two by the way we've all been review number too um little academic inside inside ball humor there um you know you'll see somebody mumbling to themselves and it and it doesn't it doesn't look like they're mumbling Pleasant things yeah we don't know what they're saying to themselves but I'm guessing if we tap them and said hey what were you m mumbling I I would guess that more than 50% of the time it was um kind of frustration with stuff you kind of see this like the frustrated person it's it's a hard thing to observe actually yeah so so um people have looked at this and my memory of this wonderful paper I think was published in science I think I think the title was a Wandering mind is an unhappy mind and um basically the Takeover from the article was that people spend between well if you look at this paper and lots of others like it what what we can deduce is that people spend between 1/ half and onethird of their waking hours not focused on the present so between 1 half and one/ third of the time we're drifting away and we're thinking about other things and this one particular paper link that process with thinking about things that cause you to feel worse I think there's huge levels of variability there though um I think a like being lost in thought can be a wonderful experience I love love love love mind wandering I think it's one of my strengths it is the source of idea generation for me it is also the source of emotion regulation I will one of you know my sleeping pill metaphorically speaking is is mental time travel it's getting away from the present it is fantasizing about the future right thinking about the good things that could happen the potentialities or going into the past and savoring some of the the positive things that happen I'm thinking about you know the the the soccer game where my kids scored goals or something good happened to someone I know or to me and and and that to me is a wonderful way of going to bed that is mental time time travel it is not being in the moment which actually raises another really important point that I want to get in there and I'd love to get your take on this because in popular culture we often hear that it's really important to be in the moment this has emerged as a type of cultural Maxim like be in the now and and this idea is often conveyed so strongly that if you're not in the moment we sometimes think there's something wrong with us like oh we got to train attention to bring it back to the present being in the present can be very useful in many contexts and certainly when we experience chatter we start worrying about the future or ruminating about the past refocusing on the present our breath a mantra yes lots of data support the utility of that but I always like to remind people that the human mind evolved to be able to travel in time and lots of amazing things accompany that process if I can't go into the past not only am I not savoring positive experiences which add joy and vitality to my life I'm also not learning from my screw-ups which sadly happened to me on a somewhat regular basis right I'm learning from my mistakes by revisiting the past and if I'm not going into the future then I'm not I'm not planning I'm not simulating I'm not fantasizing so we want to be we don't want to shut down mental time travel I think what we want to learn how to do is how to travel in time in our minds more effectively without that time travel machine breaking down in the past which is what happens when we get stuck on an experience or in the future when we just find ourselves fixating on something that we're anxious about so um so being in the moment can be good but it is not the end point I think we always want to strive for to what extent do you think that texting and smartphones but namely texting has interfered with sort of time tested meaning over hundreds of thousands of years uh time- tested mechanisms for us to process our emotions and our thoughts to arrive at better ways of thinking feeling being um you know nowadays if you get on a train or a plane or you're in an Uber or you're walk into your car and you have a like a thought about something oh that grant that idea it's so easy to just get into a mode of texting passive passive participation maybe through social media scrolling again not universally bad but you can go to passive kind of almost semi- dissociative State like you're not you're not really in the parking lot anymore you're half in your phone and half in the parking lot um and texting polling people around you as opposed to you know quote unquote in the old days where you had to actually grapple through this stuff as you describe your um the tools that you use to deal with chatter and to process information and to you know work with your thinking and your emotions you strike me as somebody who um has a rich Jungle Gym of things to play with in there yeah and a toolkit and uh an emergency switch if you need it and all that stuff whereas most people I think um just they have their phone who you going to call who you going to text what what site are you going to Google Google search to um I mean it can't be good well um it often isn't but it it it can be harnessed and and here's what the way I think about texting and really how social media and the opportunities it gives us to communicate with others whenever we want how this has thrown a curveball into the way we manage our own emotions and sometimes inadvertedly affect the emotions of not just other people but groups of people and societies so when we experience emotions we are often intensely motivated to share those experiences with others there's this wonderful research program by a Belgium psychologist by the name of Bernard R who spent his whole life looking at what do you do when you experience emotions and and he found over many decades of work that you're motivated to verbalize it to get it out and there are a couple of reasons for that we want to relate to other people get their support but we also want to usually process it in the pre-social media era um two things had to happen typically to share our emotions first you had to find someone to share them with uh and typically in the process of looking for someone either to find someone face to face or or via phone time would pass now what we know about time is that as time proceedes our emotions in general tend to fade so there's this wonderful work on the duration of emotional experiences and our emotional experiences all follow a common trajectory so something happens in the world or in our mind we imagine something that is provoking in some way our emotions get triggered and then as time goes on they eventually Peter out and depending on who the person is and what they're dealing with you know some people may Peak more intensely than others and fade more quickly some maybe have shallower Peaks and take longer to subside but they all follow that basic trajectory over time so let's go back to the pre-social media era right so you got to find someone to talk to and while you're trying to find someone to talk to time is passing that's acting to temper our emotions now once you find someone to talk to either face to face or via phone the moment you start talking you are now a wash in all of this feedback this emotional feedback whether it's coming from your face like you're giving me all sorts of information right now I would benefit from smiling if you could there we go thank you I'm just joking for those who are listening but I'm getting information from you and if I'm talking to someone on the phone likewise I'm getting their vocal tone is expressing to me how they feel that is also working to constrain how we communicate with others and it's typically keeping our emotions I would argue in check in balance in proportion we're stripping away time with social media and we're also stripping away that kind of emotional feedback this enables us to release our emotions in a much more unfiltered way and I think this is why you often have situations that people are saying things via text or online that they would never say to another person's face or over the phone and I think this is one of the factors that can promote some uh pretty negative forces in society so cyber bullying and um you know the spread of moral out AG surrounding certain issues that might take a more constructive form if they were done in a different context now that is not to say that social media isn't useful for spreading certain kinds of of messages that require attention and are deserving of collective distress it can be an amazingly useful tool that brings about needed change but I think we do need to be conscious of how interacting with this technology has really fundamentally altered the way we communicate emotional information when I think about the different ways to parse a a problem a real or imagined problem um and I think about the role of web searches um it immediately takes me to either social media or to it could be Reddit could be some article that was written and posted online in 2019 you know these will resurface they repurpose these things all the time it's I don't why they do that I just got emailed this morning about an interview to fact check that I did in 2019 go figure I mean it's cool that there's um I guess that there's um archival material on the internet that not everything is fleeting um certainly in the podcast space you know we like to think that the information on this podcast will archival um and we can update it over time and and that actually brings me to the the the very specific question which is about AI you know with AI web searches are now changing fundamentally they're you're no longer being brought to a site that is just a designated site you're getting information back that's the you know the the amalgam of a lot of information funneled through presumably the large language models are changing all the time but funneled through U kind of your search Behavior your preferences Etc so web searches are no longer just um site destination uh Journeys they are you know uh recipes of information that are filtered and combined and given back to us which makes me think that maybe AI can provide a kind of pseudo self that is wiser than ourselves in any moment or potentially wiser than we are in any moment because they can access information that is not dependent on like bodily State shifts like like at 2:30 in the morning 3:30 in the morning a a small problem can seem huge and a huge problem can seem absolutely overwhelming just crushing us mhm at 7:00 A.M it's different when we search on the web now like how to you know how to get through bankruptcy let's say somebody's dealing with bankruptcy they're going to there's information to go to but with AI it can give you the information in the form and in the and from the sources that are most meaningful to you and it doesn't even if it's 2:30 in the morning for you the AI is fresh it doesn't need to sleep right that seems to me like a distinct advantage over our own minds and I know AI is controversial is it going to get smarter than us is it going to tell us to go do bad things kind of thing okay that's a whole different discussion but seems to me the AI could be pretty good maybe even terrific at helping us resolve problems because it doesn't have these State shifts and it's really tailored to us well it it can be and I think you know AI I think of it as a as a new tool that is has you know amazing potential um and I actually think it has the potential to help us advance on a problem where psychologists like myself currently find ourself fixed so if I if I look back at the last 20 30 years of research on emotion regulation I'm talking here not just about managing chatter but managing the whole Suite of unwanted emotional states that we might encounter in our lives what I can do is I can point to several individual tools that are empirically supported science-based tools and scientists have do done a really good job profiling how these individual tools work mechanistically they've often gone down to the to the brain level they've looked at them in intervention context and everything in between so we have a pretty good sense of how individual tools work but what we are now learning is individual tools are not the name of the game because we are often doing multiple things to manage our emotions and the combinations of tools we use within people they often vary across situations in ways that we don't completely understand and there's variability between people as well so the the Blends or cocktails of tools that are most beneficial to us remain to be illuminated so if someone comes to me with a problem I can go through all the tools in the toolbx what I can't do is I can't prescribe combinations of tools and say hey for the kinds of problems that you are experiencing and the kind of person that you are here are the four things that you should do but that person over there they should do these six things I think AI has the potential with the right inputs to help us learn about those patterns that explain how to optimize emotion regulation on an individual basis and that is a remarkably tantalizing possibility for that technology you mentioned you have kids yeah um when my sister who's three years older than I am uh was a kid my dad tells the story that um she had an imaginary friend Larry Larry was a girl lived in a purple house you know this imaginary friend Larry had all the the um the components of a a child's mind that is unrestricted by all the barriers of naming and things like that you know um and my dad said that my sister used to play with Larry in her room for hours just talking to Larry and like you know with her doll houses and her toys and her things and doing and then one day my dad uh he loves this story I don't know why he loves the story in particular but he he was standing outside her door and she was playing with Larry her imaginary friend talking to Larry and then she stopped and turned around and he said um how's Larry and she said Larry's dead and he she never talked about Larry again like it was this sort of collision between Fantasy Life and real world this is how I interpret it and that was it yeah Larry was done yeah poor Larry poor Larry well maybe it was time you know I mean she was maybe going to be seven soon and maybe maybe it served her well so I've always wanted to ask somebody this question I think you are the person to ask this question are Imaginary Friends common in children and are Imaginary Friends the primordial form of our internal dialogue with our self just fascinated by and are there some adults who maintain imaginary friends and the re and I'll set an additional context which which will be especially relevant to the listeners of this podcast which was in the very seat that you're sitting about this time last year David Goggins was here and he was talking about you know how he pushes himself through tremendously hard things and during that discussion it became very clear that David has a an array of different voices that are all him but that serve different roles yeah and it was a remarkable thing to hear him articulate that because to to those of us on the outside we observe as like one person but he's constructed in an elaborate inner world to be able to equip himself to do the things he does and I just have to wonder whether or not this whole thing of imaginary friends provided it doesn't take us into the realm of psychosis and delusion could actually be useful yeah isn't it remarkable that this is um this is such a common human experience and for most people they never talk about this with anyone else because this is such a private experience so I often start start presentations with a quote from rapael Nadal the tennis great uh him answering a question about what's the hardest thing that he struggles with and he says it's it's managing the voices plural in my head and I and I go to the audience and I say hey what do you do if someone comes up to you at a party and says Uh there's struggling with the voices inside their head right like that is typically warning sign right that maybe something is aai here and someone needs support yet this is a very common feature of the human experience that we just never really touch on so to answer your question is a common to for kids to have imaginary friends and maybe talk to themselves yes um uh I believe this is called the study of pretense um according to one famous Soviet Psych ol ologist named Lev votsi one of the ways self-control is first learned is actually through selft talk and so what happens is you you as a child will hear your parents telling you to do things Andrew you should do this or don't do that and sit this way and not that way and then what children will often do is go off on their own and they will repeat those kinds of messages out loud to themselves and so if you've ever been around young kids you've probably seen them talking out loud to themselves or playing with dolls and no Jimmy shouldn't do this Jimmy should do that some kids do it in the form not of with an actual toy but they have an imaginary friend in their mind that they are engaging with these different interactions and what the kids are doing in those contexts according to this idea is they are they're practicing self-control they are they are repeating the things the messages that their caretakers have told to them right they are rein forcing it in those ways and then as time goes on and your sister demonstrated this that outer voice becomes our inner voice and we have the capacity to recruit that inner voice then throughout our lives but it is interesting that during moments of extreme stress many people sometimes report actually talking to themselves out loud right and there's very little research on this and a lot of this is um anecdotal but I have um when speaking to a lot of individuals say yeah sometimes I will actually just start talking to myself out loud and I thought something was wrong with me and it's always when I'm struggling with uh like a major stressor so if we go back to reviewer number two right in the academic world I remember once I wrote this invited article and um a reviewer did not say very nice things to me in this in this response and I remember just walking I was I was it was so offensive I remember walking around the neighborhood and I why don't you say that to my face you know and I was just repeating what they said and I was rehearsing it I was getting more and more upset and then ultimately working through it but it almost seems like in real moments of stress we revert back to this very primordial way of regulating ourselves that we first exercised when we were kids which is this selft talk and so so David has become exceptionally skilled at harnessing different voices according to you to manage the challenges that he is facing uh I've heard David talk on a number of occasions and uh I think there is another important point to to bring up here which is I'm pretty sure that when David is activating different voices they're not always a very gentle voice that is encouraging him to take it easy and be kind to sometimes yes and sometimes this is important because negative selft talk is often equated with harmful outcomes negative emotions are functional when they're activate in the right proportions sometimes being firm with yourself can be quite effective so if I go to when I'm exercising and I'm doing classes sometimes where coaches are telling me to do really painful things like sometimes I'm pretty tough on myself I'm channeling my high school wrestling coach who is really hard on me right you know you you you you better like shape up you know you can't you know wimp out here that serves an a motivating function for me there so if we're recruiting some negative voices that isn't bad per se what is bad is if we start looping that is the what we really want to equate with chatter it's getting stuck in those thought Loops that's when things get get harmful when those negative emotions are tweaked too intensely or for too long a couple of times we've talked about the relationship between pH physical activities and mental activities um in particular taking a walk going into green spaces and I was delighted to hear when you said that there's a vast literature supporting the use of green spaces yeah for calming ourselves is that essentially what the data show well it goes a little bit um Beyond even just calming so yes there is data linking uh going for a walk in a in a beautiful setting with uh feeling better uh but but but scientists have actually gone even deeper to understand the the various mechanisms through which interacting with green spaces and other kinds of environments can help us and so there are two major Pathways that I often talk about one is interacting with a green space can be cognitively restorative so as we talked about earlier when people get stuck experiencing chatter or other kinds of big emotions uh our attention often fixates on on the problem at hand we focus really hard in trying to work through the problem and that can drain us of our precious attentional resources well when you go for a a walk in a safe natural setting you're surrounded by interesting cues that capture your attention in a very gentle way so I'm talking about the flowers and the the the the the trees the scents The Sounds our attention often drifts onto those features of our environment now most of us are not doing the uh equivalent of carrying a magnifying glass and studying this the geometrical structure of the leaves and the flowers right we're just kind of taking it in but the surroundings are are sufficiently intriguing to capture to grasp our attention and that gives us this opportunity to restore that precious commodity so there's work there's a lot of work showing that going for a walk in a safe natural setting um can be cognitively restorative that's another feature nature that or another mechanism through which nature exposure can help us the other pathway that I just find so it's this is so so cool from a research point of view going for walks in in in natural settings often elicit the emotion of awe which is an emotion we experience when we're in the presence of of something vast and Indescribable something that just feels bigger than ourselves so in um in the arborium near my house there are these trees that have been there for hundreds of years and you look up at these trees and you think my God like you've been there way longer than me and my parents and my grandparents and you probably will be there longer than all of my progeny like wow that just broadens my perspective or an amazing Sunset you can also experience this emotion through Feats of of innovation so I'm a I'm a science geek I guess you could say and for me the the the two biggest awe triggers are uh number one the images of the Galaxy that the latest telescope produces which if you follow this we sum physicists have sometime somehow figured out Engineers how to take pictures of what the the universe looked like billions of years ago somehow I don't understand the physics we can see what it looked like this you know vast amounts of time ago and we also of course have the equivalent of an SUV currently roaming on Mars sending us back footage of that planet so when I think of that like we've actually landed a vehicle on another planet this vastly expands like I am filled with awe so when we are experiencing something vast and Indescribable like that this is the ultimate perspective Roder so it leads to what we call shrinking of the self we feel smaller when we're contemplating something vast and Indescribable and when we feel smaller guess what else feels smaller problems are problems so this is a an easy way of utilizing the world around you to powerfully manage your emotions and so what I love about that work is it highlights the fact that there are tools that are just hidden in plain sight they're waiting to be harnessed and if you know where to look you can often find them and the nature by the way isn't the only set of environmental tools that exist there are lots of ways that you can interact with your environment strategically to help you feel better we often develop attachments to places for example so um have you you're probably familiar with the concept of attachment figures so there are these uh figures from our childhood that um we often though not always securely attach to they are a source of safety and comfort and they serve a powerful regulatory role in our lives and our partners if we're in positive relationships as I am love you um as to my wife she is an attachment figure for me well we also develop these associations with places and so sometimes places can be the source of safety and comfort going back to those places during times of distress can be really rejuvenating um I know I know one person who um discovered that uh you know his there was infidelity in his relationship and what really helped him get a grip on the situation was going back to his childh at home and sleeping in his bedroom at home that was the the turning point that allowed him to reroute his ability to navigate his life um that's an example of of the power of places to affect us so so how many times do we think about hey what are the places that are my emotional oases if you will that I can go to when I need it we can also structure our environments like you and I are both talking right now across the table from one another we don't have our cell phones out on the table no not for me not even in the room not in the room for me either if we did and we had it facing up we would be distracted Would we not without question even facing down I think there's some literature on this right still a queue it's still an emo there's a cognitive tether like we're sort of I mean because the thing signals um a particular a particular reward and a and a particular set of behaviors right just like a pen only a few things you can I mean probably many things you do with a pen but typically one this is not John Wick here this one thing that we're talking about we're not we're not getting uh we're not getting Innovative here with with these objects but right when the pen excuse me when the phone is present even if it's face down it cues the uh the opportunity to make a call receive a text look on social media scroll the internet find out what's happened to and so by leaving our phones outside of the space we are we are managing our emotions in a very blunt and effective way when laptop screens are open in my seminars I know that I've already lost the battle because I know this this the the object the stimulus is so tempting even if I'm the most captivating professor in the world which I am not I aspire to be captivating but I know that I'm always going to lose compared to the screen the email them to close I as them to yeah no laptops in my in my class wow how is that received so far so good um you know I I explain to them I actually explain to them the science behind this I explain why I'm doing this and I say that hey if I have my laptop open and I'm in your shoes I this is a divided attention task I'm not able to focus as well as if I don't have it open and in the courses that I teach it's more about discussion and thinking through things so they don't really have a need to you know type notes for exams which I think makes it easier for me um but but modifying our space is really strategically like this is another valuable tool in um in our toolbox like when we have people over for football watching parties let's say it's pretty common where I come from in an arbor and uh I my favorite food in the world is is pizza and we have this wonderful New York City city style pizza place in ant Arbor now I will order vast amounts of it much more than we need and when the the game is over I will insist that everyone take it with them because I know if if it is in the refrigerator and I open the refrigerator later that night to just get some water if I see the pizza box the queue it will elicit a emotional response this desire this repetitive response to consume the pizza which is not the goal that I have from either a fitness or a motion regul regulatory point of view so I am structuring my spaces strategically all the time to give me the best chance of being successful at at meeting my regulatory goals I'm so glad you brought up pizza and New York Pizza and the fact that you're from New York here's why um and again I give a personal example only as uh a template for people to think about themselves sure either where it matches or doesn't match what I'm about to ask I love being in nature I love being up in Yos and rural areas and at the coast I was love love being in nature and the quiet of nature I find my my mind slows and my thoughts um and my emotions enter a a pace that just is very soothing I also love being in New York City I was first in New York City when I was about five or six years old and I remember telling my dad who's from another big city Bor Osiris I remember telling him like I can't I can't believe this exists like can we come back here and I I swore that I would go back as many times as I possibly could and I I love going to New York City despite it having many problems it's still a wonderful City when I'm in New York there's tons of activity there's tons of stimuli yeah and I also find that my mind achieves that slowed Pace another parallel construction here and then I'll I'll wage the the specific question I've worked with professors U my postt adviser for instance and my graduate adviser worked extremely effectively these are hyperfocused unfortunately both of them have passed but hyperfocused brilliant people truly brilliant and their offices were a complete disaster and we'd say Ben you need to clean your office and he would say no no no don't move anything like otherwise I won't know where anything is and I'm like how can you know where anything is like this this it look it looks like an earthquake hit yesterday and he was don't touch anything and he and he could find things in this like dizzyingly messy environment as some you know he was the The Stereotype of the professor sitting hunched over at his keyboard at 2: in the morning cuz at that time I worked really late you'd go into Ben's office you hey you know and it organized thinking amidst chaos yeah and the New York example would be the parallel and at The Other Extreme nature also seems to bring this about so two specific questions is there a Continuum of let's say daytime let's forget about middle of the night of daytime kind of default of chatter I think of this as kind of RPM in a car like like how is the car idling like when you turn on the car you just sit there like if the transmission's working well and everything's working well it's like hums it a nice it's not redlining yeah some people seem to be redlining all the time yeah and they calm down in t in cluttered environments so how much is do we have a kind of a set point a chatter set point assuming everything else equal well rested etc etc and then why is it that external environment matching our internal chatter somehow like can adjust that internal set point it seems I realize this is very abstract but for me it's very useful to think about where my mind goes into its most Pleasant and effective States yeah um your example of your advisers resonates so strongly with myself is your office a mess well it it entirely depends on my mental state and prior to really getting involved in the space I had no insight into why sometimes my office was a total mess and sometimes it is in Span unbelievably organized and clean uh and so let me share with you some of the research in the space because I think it'll bear on this question you're asking a lot of people find that when they are experiencing chatter they reflexively start organizing their spaces so I'm a great example of this I my entire life if we called my mother up right now please let's not do it but if we did uh she could attest to the fact that there would always be a trail of of towels and clothing from the bathroom to my bedroom and all over the place and my office is similar um piles of papers and books and that's when life is good I'm kind of free flowing I'm getting in there I'm being creative I'm generating ideas and I'm not really worried about everything around me in fact I'm really good at typically like tuning out my surroundings to to focus in on the task at hand I could work in a coffee shop I could work almost anywhere and I I love it when I'm experiencing chatter though and this is true from the time I was little I would always start putting things away I would always start organizing things making them nice and tidy um my office is always spotless sometimes I even take it further presently when I'm experiencing chatter I clean up my office then I go into the kitchen and I make sure that's nice and tidy and if it's really bad like I'll clean up my kids rooms and things like that this is a very common experience when you're experiencing chatter you don't feel like you are in control you're not in the driver's seat the thoughts and feelings are taking over and they're pushing you in directions and to places that you don't want to be it's an aversive State and it's chronically activated for a lot of people human beings in general We crave control we like to know that the world is orderly and predictable there's s survival value that that communicates to us right if we know things are certain and and you know proceeding in a in a predictable way creating order around us compensates for the lack of order and control we feel inside it's called compensatory control and this is the explanation that is often provided for why so many of us augment our spaces to counteract in this case our emotional state and so I don't know if that perfectly answers your question but it it for me highlights the way that we are tightly Tethered to our surroundings in some circumstances when I'm not experiencing chatter it really doesn't matter if the place is nice and tidy versus not like no big deal but when I move motivated to think feel and behave in a particular way then my circumstances are becoming more important I mean the the military is a very Salient example where people have have their their um their kit in order yeah um uh in order to essentially be able to proceed with the job right and and people can say what they will about the military but the the structure and the hierarchy of the military has provided a structure and an order for people to um essentially um harness a a take go from a chaotic life to a structured life that's right you know and um it's an extreme example um but having everything squared away is is one of those things I I got certified a scuba dive a few years ago and you know it occurred to me early on in the first Dives that you know if if your kit isn't squared away and you don't have everything worked out things can go badly wrong and the um severity of the of the potential consequences or the potential severity of the consequences uh I suppose it's the right way I say it is a good reminder like to have everything in check this isn't the kind of thing where you can afford to forget a piece of gear or to not check a valve or you know uh it it's potentially life or death and that serves a an Adaptive role it's it's kind of nice to have a an activity actually where where that's that's the case whereas we get into our cars and we might pull out the driveway and then go down the street and now you see people texting and driving all the time hopefully less as time goes on and you know you see then you might put on your seat belt you know like a you know a quarter mile down the road you might put on first right I always put mine on first when you know when I remember I'm sure now someone will catch me with my seat belt off but um I drive with a seat belt and so on and so on the physical steps that we take to organize ourselves and the environment and our relationship to the environment really do seem to to change our brain into a different brain than were we to not do those things the way I carve up the emotion regulation space is there are multiple shifters that exist some of those shifters are inside us so there are these sensory shifters we talked about there are tensional shifters we haven't gotten into that yet but you know we can shine our mental Spotlight on or away from things that are causing emotions and we can be strategic in how we do that there are perspective shifters way we the way we think about our circumstances reframing distancing those are all on the inside but then there are also shifters that exist outside of us in our relationships how other people can push our emotions in different directions sometimes other people can be amazing assets sometimes tremendous liabilities there are physical shifters like in our spaces and we just talked about those you can then go a layer out even further and talk about culture as a shifter people talk about culture as the air we breathe right we are we are in different cultures throughout our lives and sometimes we move from one culture to another within the day so you know if you're going to your your lab or you're on campus at Stanford that's one very specific culture with certain values and norms and and and weird practices maybe um that's no offense to Stanford by the way that's more academics Academia has some weird practices if you then go to your podcast Community right the the team in the studio that we're sitting here there are different there's a different culture that characterizes the way you function here and those cultures that we are a part of they powerfully shape our emotional lives they indicate they they they influence what kinds of emotional experiences we value so what kinds of emotional experience are we motivated to have they give us practices rituals to meet those emotion regulatory goals that we have as well so that's another kind of influence that I don't think we often think about but that is really quite powerful it brings me back again to the the smartphone you know the smartphone carries an infinite number of contexts into the different environments with us um so we're on the train but we could be paying attention to something overseas and I was on the plane this morning and I I just marveled at the number of screens MH on this um frankly very densely packed plane was like probably fourth grade when a kid brought in a little mini TV and I remember thinking oh my goodness that's like a mini TV it looked kind of like a walkie-talkie and the resolution was terrible and of course it was all black and white they had color TVs by the way when I was when I was young it just hadn't made it to the mini TV and we were basically walking around with little mini TVs all day yeah with near infinite number of channels combined with texting I mean it's wild remarkable science it's science fiction if we were to turn back the clock to when we were kids to think about what we have in our pockets right now or on our wrists or some people the glasses that they are wearing we probably wouldn't have believed that this was possible when we were kids I agree I agree and I I'm just struck by the fact that our brains can adapt to this but I do think that most people probably wonder about about you know like what's the optimal way to live and and the word optimal gets people a little you know little triggered sometimes believe it or not I'm not talking about what puts people into their best performance mode or this or that I'm not talking about biohacking I'm referring to you know there's age-old question you know what what is a good life and and that's a completely different podcast that we should probably do at some point but it probably involves being able to pay attention to things and be present but also let one's mind drift and be socially present and have relationships and on and on do you think that we are in fact more challenged nowadays in the default mode of so many contexts arriving with us in our pocket When we arrive in a situation like you said come to the studio I'm as long as my phone's face down or away from me I'm in the studio otherwise I brought the whole world with me yeah this is a question that comes up quite a bit and it's a really hard one to answer because we haven't of course been tracking people's chatter and emotion disregulation levels over the centuries I think it's absolutely true that we now have um new forms of technology that are perennially now presenting us with challenges that we need to figure out how to overcome but they are also providing us with opportunities so um to be clear I think social media and Technology uh can and does do a lot of harm and I think it can and does do a lot of good for us as well and the real challenge we face right now is figuring out how to navigate those those digital technological Landscapes and I think we probably jumped into them um without a user guide too quickly and we're only learning now 15 years later or whatever the number is that that was the case but um but I don't know that I would I don't know that well I'll speak for myself I think net positive there's a lot of good that has come from these Technologies if we think back centuries ago um it's not clear to me that the world wasn't a a challenging Place either I mean you know um we used to to get into fights and pull swords and uh there is huge you know people would invade readily if you go back further and we there was the threat of illness and you know we weren't living nearly as long and so I think it's easy to also forget just how far we have come as a species but and this is I think a really important but and I think about this often the issues that we are talking about today on this podcast this question of how we manage our emotional lives this is a question that we have been struggling with likely for as long as we have been roaming the planet in our current form because humans have constantly been evolving new technologies we've always been challenged by circumstances and those circumstances are constantly invol evolving providing new new threats to us that now we need to learn how to manage um when you know when I was digging deep into the history of emotion regulation for for for for shift um I couldn't believe it that when I when I um when I looked back at the first surgical tool ever developed you know what that is trening trening so tonation tell everyone who's listening what that involved trening is where you bore a hole through the skull in order to let out some volume of fluid some volume of fluid or or remove brain or brain or if we go back 8 to 10,000 years ago when this technology was first Cutting Edge right like the new iPhone of the times tonation for Spirits for maybe Spirits right so one of the reasons it was believed to be used was to allow the evil spirits to escape that are may maybe causing tremendous emotion disregulation so that was a Cutting Edge tool at one moment in time that we use to manage our emotions then let's let's jump into the mental time travel ma or just the time travel machine and go to the late 1940s where there was another major spike on the emotion regulation Innovation timeline you know where I'm going with this intended I'm guessing you're talking about the labotomy that's right the frontal labotomy Portuguese physician develops the labotomy I think it was initially called The Lucy um essentially making some holes in your frontal cortex through going up through the orbit of the eye through the eye sweeping it back and forth this was an an not just an outpatient surgery but a mobile surgery they would arrive to people's homes I think I could be wrong but I think a Nobel prize was given for the labotomy well there you go that's the relieved anxiety unfortunately it relieved a lot of other many other things relieved people's interest in pursuing lots of things it caused major major major um dysfunction and to be clear this is not an advocated emotion regulation intervention it hasn't been for a while well that's why I said don't box you know prefrontal cortical damage is is a common feature of people with or even I don't know if this is true someone needs to check but I I do hear that some sadly some soccer players who head the ball a lot deal with some front uh uh you know frontal cortical related dementia type stuff I'm guessing that's probably related to some genetic susceptability because at least to me the soccer ball is not very hard it's not like they're you know it's but um and then again there of course people who play a whole career of football yeah um or box less seldom boxing people get hit a lot in the head often have problems yeah they they develop problems yeah generally not a good thing but but you know just to go back to the labotomy what's amazing to me is like that was perceived to be such an advance that it won the Nobel Prize like the Nobel Prize because it calm people down calm people down right and and we so so I rais these issues to to just point that like we've been struggling to identify tools to manage our emotions effectively for a really long time and now fast forward to the present we have not solved the puzzle of emotion regulation yet but I would argue that we have made major advances in identifying non-invasive science-based tools that can be leveraged to help people lead more productive emotional lives and so um you know you raised this question earlier about what is a productive life uh what is a good life and uh I think answering that question is in part relev to how I think about how do you like Define self-control in many ways or emotion regulation or or let me not not just how you define it but what are the component parts so we've been talking about tools throughout this conversation all like these different tools that exist these different shifters for pushing our emotions or chatter around that's one core part of regulating effectively but another core part is our motivation or our goals and you need both motivation and tools so I can know about all the tools on the planet that scientists have discovered if I'm not motivated to manage my emotions I'm not going to use those tools if on the other hand I am highly motivated to regulate my emotions but I don't know what the tools are I'm not going to be that effective and I may in fact do some bad things right I may I may you know use unhealthy tools substances that really can very powerfully M you know substance abuse I'm talking about that can modulate my emotions but has some negative consequences so it's about what are my goals for me for my emotional life and do I possess the tools that allow me to accomplish those goals I think that is a formula for the good life hey here are the goals that I have and if these are healthy productive goals and I have the means to achieve them that should bring me a sense of satisfaction sometimes our goals of course aren't optimal and use that maybe controversial world word but um we do change our goals throughout our life but it's about finding the right set of goals for us as individuals and then identifying the tools that we can use to bring those goals to fruition yeah in keeping with this historical Arc of the tools that humans have used to try and regulate emotion you mentioned trening uh frontal lobotomy think about um a barbaric appearing uh procedure but one that actually is pretty effective in the right hands um and that is still commonly used today electric shock therapy um which at a mechanistic level you know we don't understand we don't really understand but it seems to lead to kind of massive dump of a bunch of neuromodulators dopamine serotonin but like you know almost willy-nilly like just um and then nowadays there's a lot of at least interest if not enthusiasm more work is needed on um the very psychedelics in particular psilocybin and MDMA uh for depression and PTSD um more specifically and while those are more in the serotonergic pathway the my read of the data is that you know they they're creating you know more brainwide connectivity at resting state I mean there's still fairly crude tools yeah in terms of you're massively changing the levels of given neurom modulators you people are undergoing variable experiences it's not directed in any any any way Nolan Williams at Stanford is combining those things with transcranial Magnetic stimulations to try and essentially highlight the activity of particular circuits during the Psychedelic Journeys and and after um things of that sort so it's getting more specific but I would say even today we we don't really have great pharmacologic or surgical tools for emotion now there's terrific neurosurgery going on mind you um but when it comes to behavioral tools tools for emotion regulation I feel like the psychologists you all you and your colleagues have done a tremendous job as have the people from you know for lack of a better name the sort of ancient traditions and from the uh Wellness Community you know things like long exhale breathing physiological size meditation Wendy Suzuki's Lab at at NYU showing you 13 minutes a day of meditation improves Focus emotion reg emotional state so it seems to me that the behavioral tools are getting way out ahead of the surgical and even pharmacologic Tools in terms of their specificity their safety and maybe even their potency would you care to reflect on on what you see as the most valuable tools for emotion regulation uh you've touched on some of them today but already but I mean taking a walk green spaces time you know mental time travel fantasy I listed a few more of these off I mean these might seem kind of uh more modal you know you know top level Contour things but they work right I mean the data say they work journaling yeah they I mean and they're they're mechanistically we you know we understand the mechanisms that that are underlying the benefits of these tools um they are easy to implement and in not always but for a lot of them they're easy and I think that's in part where their power resides um we are still trying to understand how the brain functions as you will know you've contributed to this I've worked on this a little bit myself too the brain is a remarkably complicated organ and and we still have a lot to learn um I'm a big fan of trying to understand how phenomena like emotion play out at different levels of analysis at the psychological level of thinking and feeling but also at the biological level in terms of patterns of neural activity and hormones and so forth and so on and so I think there's great hope that we will be able to eventually down the road try to help people manage their emotions through multiple different sources of intervention through the pharmacological level through the behavioral level through the interpersonal level but it's a messy messy space right now and I think one of the big problems is and this is in part gets to bigger questions about science and how science is done it can be hard to cross levels of analysis and there are multiple practical constraints that become active here so having the you know large enough samples and the right collaborators to look at how different kinds of interventions interact with one another working different populations and so we tend not to do those more complicated designs because they're a lot harder to do they take a ton more money a ton more time and effort and often times scientists are on timelines and their incentive structures that guide the kind of work that they do but big picture down the road I think the the the big questions are about how do these different kinds of interventions interact with one another the good news is though that for any person who is watching or listening who's motivated to manage their emotions right now there are many things you can do to start and it begins step one learning about what these tools are and then starting this process of experimenting with the tools I don't use that word experimenting lightly I wouldn't Advocate experimenting with with agents that have serious side effects of the sort that some of the biological interventions you articulated earlier do those kinds of tools I think should be used in the context of of medical supervision but a lot of these other tools that we're talking about small changes and how you think and behave and interact with your environments those are things people can start doing right now one of the most common questions I've received over the years is on YouTube in particular is how to stop intrusive voices and occasionally when people ask these questions they'll highlight that some parent or an ex or something will kind of a judge voice in there and they don't know if it's their voice or the other person's voice but it's in their head and it's very unpleasant um presuming this uh circles back to Childhood traumas or other forms of traumas but irrespective of the origins are there any tools specifically to deal with intrusive thoughts and and thought patterns maybe even OCD like thought patterns um so a couple of of responses to that so uh first of all I think Step One is recognizing that if you are hearing another voice uh like if you can hear your your dad's voice in your head it's not your dad who is in your head that is a simulation that you are engaging in that your brain is capable of producing and so that I think can be informative for for people who are curious about these inner worlds like I can I'm not referring to auditory hallucinations I'm referring to you know the language of somebody maybe not in their that person's voice but they're hearing like maybe not you're a bad person but like you're you're never good you're not good enough like it's not enough or or or just feeling like so you know they can't enjoy what the the good things in life because of these intrusive negative voices here's something that I hope listeners and viewers will find exceptionally liberating as I have found liberating from just knowing the science so actually I talk about these intrusive thoughts in in shift um they are incredibly normative and so there's research which looks at like how frequently have you experienced an intrusive thought over the past week or month or two months the proportion of people who experience these dark thoughts is exceptionally High uh I don't remember the exact percentage but it is in my book and it is like near ceiling I will do an exercise with my my classes my undergraduate classes where I will ask them to anonymously uh describe the whether they've experienced like a dark thought over the past week almost all of them are capable of Genera and some of this these thoughts are really really dark I uh I will often experience a very dark intrusive thought when I'm exercising at the gym you're looking at me with curiosity and a bit of concern right now no not concern I'm just fascinated you know I have ideas about why this may be but I'm just I'm just fascinated I don't know that I've had dark thoughts in the gym but I it's interesting here's my dark thought watch out if you see me in the gym from here on so if I'm carrying like a a a heavy dumbbell from a bench to a rack I will sometimes have a thought of dropping it on on the face of another person on a mad oh my goodness it's terribly dark terrible ter a terrible terrible thought so why why am I experiencing that is most likely um the brain's simulating worst case scenarios to prevent me from doing it of course I don't want to drop a dumble on someone I never have and so that's one explanation for why this is so normative it's it's your brain's way of constantly we're there's a theory that we're constantly simulating all sorts of possibilities for what could happen and most of these simulations the probability of them coming to fruition are exceptionally low infinitesimally small but on occasion some of the wacky ones do Escape into awareness and that's when we get the dark thought about harming someone or doing something illegal in a pretty aggress you know egregious way or in my case dropping the dumbbell on you know the person stretching on their face and so here's what I find liberating me understanding that this is just how my brain works well that doesn't mean now that I'm I'm something wrong with me as a human being right that I'm morally corrupt in any way my brain's going to sometimes produce these kinds of dark thoughts I'm not going to act on them and as long as I'm not acting on them it's all good it's almost like when people learn about the physiological response to anxiety before they know what is happening that can often be an incredibly distressing experience like all of a sudden your stomach is churning your your palms are sweating but in research which shows like if you if you communicate to people hey this is just your body preparing yourselves to adaptively respond to this uncertain circumstance you face all of a sudden you are totally flipping the frame and now this is I'm a l Lamborghini right I am rising to the occasion my body is doing what it should be doing to allow me to excel here that's the kind of flip that I think understanding the frequency and origins of intrusive thoughts can have for folks so step one is just recognizing If you experience intrusive thoughts at times again welcome to The Human Condition it's it's a little blip in how our brain operates uh but a lot of these tools have also been shown to be useful for nipping repetitive thinking in the body so when you're Cur you're curtailing chatter you are also um curtailing the likelihood of perseverating the reason why we often perseverate on on problems we're experiencing is we are we're highly motivated to make sense of these circumstances so we can move on with our lives and our brain this wonderful problemsolving organ that we possess it just keeps churning until we solve that problem and that's surfacing all sorts of related thoughts here and there until you until you get there and so you solve the problem those thoughts tend to subside too I have um two uh two points both of which are essentially questions um I think it's relatively common for people when they go to a bridge or a dam or something very like something very high with the potential for you know essentially a fatal fall where they to jump off to to have the thought you know what keeps me from jumping off when in fact they absolutely don't want to jump off and it seems like it's another examp example like it's registering the danger and the severity of the the consequences it also I realize helps us understand the level of risk that's right you know I think Alex honold who you know famously did free solo to lcap um a remarkable movie by the way just along the lines of what we're talking about you the way the movie is constructed and I think Jimmy chin and and colleagues who made that movie just such an incredible job not just with the cinematography but you know he survives from the very beginning of the movie and yet it's terrify to watch the whole thing and it's kind of a a hour 45 minute um expedition of exactly what we're talking about uh in that movie as I recall Alex spells out the um the assessment of risk and consequence right you know um you level of risk level of consequence and and how that's a those are key parameters to evaluate and and he's obviously done that for himself and he succeeded and I hope he never does it again only because uh he seems like a really uh delightful person would it would be nice to keep him around um and he's doing other important work now but the point being that I think it's a it's a very natural thing to evaluate risk and consequence in a way that quote unquote feels dark yeah but it's actually highly adaptive through the lens that we're talking about it um so that's one point well just just to that point if I can interject so um just to to normalize this further for folks so uh my family is very special to me as it is to most people when my first daughter was born we used to live in this house that had this on the second floor there was a I don't know if you'd describe it as an overpass but it was open to the floor beneath and I remember having these intrusive thoughts of at night when we'd have to bring my daughter into the bedroom to feed her or change her diaper whatever I would have these thoughts of carrying her and then dropping her over into the you know and splat like not pleasant thoughts to experience in the middle of the night it's speaks to this point that you are raising that was likely my mind's way of homing in on a really really important issue in my life that I want to make sure never ever ever happens it is not an indication that I'm morally corrupt or incredibly dark person it's it's how my brain is operating so yeah you're assessing risk and consequence in an Adaptive way um yeah it's it's uh it's fascinating to think about the second comment slash question um I'd love your thoughts on is you know I had this Bulldog I talk about him all the time this Bulldog Mastiff and and he had one default behavior that if he couldn't engage in it would create anxiety in him and that was he liked to chew right he he liked to gnaw things as a puppy he actually would teethe on bricks in the backyard I was like oh my goodness it looks so painful to me sometimes bite through a lip you know the the Bulldog part of their phenotype is that a lot of the pain receptors have been bred out of their face and so they and I just think oh my goodness I go out there and I you know I was like distraught at how much pain he must be causing himself it was obviously less than I I perceived but nonetheless this gnawing Behavior was what was so you could just see it it gave him such pleasure right you give him something a CH and just you could just see the anxiety like dissolve out of him I've known a number of people that are fairly high intensity in terms of they speak fast you high density of thought information Etc at least outward who claim that they have got sort of a high RPM internally and I I vary and depending on time of day and time of year on this but I place myself more or less into that category engaging in an activity that harnesses my full attention perhaps we could call it flow but nonetheless engaging in an activity that harnesses my full attention feels to me so unbelievably satisfying yeah so unbelievably satisfying I think it's for two reasons one is the the benefits of doing those activities studying learning podcasting doing research you know connecting with someone in a really directed way like getting into that tunnel with them as we're doing now there's a positive feature and then there's the also the removal of a negative like that those RPM are not humming in the back in the background and I think for a lot of people you know like Ultra Runners and um you know I I know a lot of former addicts that start running marathons and get so and stay sober yeah it's remarkable how physical activity or cognitive activity can kind of take us into that plane of focus that both makes us productive makes us fitter but also relieves this inner voice it kind of like lets the tension out the same way that I observed Costello letting the tension out through gnawing on these bricks or rawh hides or whatever whatever it was and so my question is um is is there as I'm assuming a relationship between the physical and the mental do we basically have a certain amount of energy in us and it varies between people and we need to harness Andor adjust that level of energy and to do that in ways that hopefully make us a living or you know bring our social relationships more closely together well uh it's certainly plays out in physical context as you're describing but it also as you alluded to plays out in cognitive contexts when there is this match this sweet spot between the the the demands like you're in a situation that is is actually challenging either physically or cognitively and the the resources that you bring to that situation perfectly match the demands so it's a taxing situation but you are able to engage with it completely that is the formula for getting stuck is the wrong word for getting immersed in these kinds of flow states which are for many people the the goal that they have in their lives both recreational and professionally and so you as someone who is ideally getting into these flow states with your guests I would hope and imagine and that's always the aspiration like that must feel really good I mean you talk for a long time with people does it feel like a long time when you're having those conversations no time perception completely changes I I do this for two or three hours a week and then when we do a solo episode sometimes the recordings longest ever yet is 11 hours you know edited down but those can be anywhere from you know 90 minutes to 4 hours and or a live event um and I couldn't tell you it just seems like time just time dissolves away and when you know that is because you are so absorbed in the moment and meeting the the challenges of that situation that all of your attention is commanded to that that point in time that moment and that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for all of the uh the chatter to percolate in in the background and so you know one often you might think like an ultra marathon or what's the correct term is that it it's called an ultra I think uh we have some uh triathletes here in the room our producer Rob Moore um sitting to my left um we've never done this before but how long is an ultra anything longer than a marathon is that right he's giving a nod he's going to remain silent um anything longer than a marathon is considered an ultra and so that's a lot of time on the one hand to to be alone with your thoughts right and you might think that might just be grounds for experiencing chatter but it's also a particularly challenging kind of physical feat that you have to devote a lot of resources to meeting those physical demands and right so that can Propel you into a state of flow and then you get some um Runners High to boot some like chemical boost to enhance your mood and all of a sudden now you have people running you know 130 miles I'm exaggerating how long is it oh people I mean people have done 200 mile ultas 150 M Ultras people we have a friend uh you know again my producer Rob Mo and I have a friend Ken Ry out who um does these sorts of races in the um Gobi Desert um he did it without any prior training in the desert then one I mean there but you know these Ken in particular I'm thinking about right now he's a very high energy guy I would be concerned about Ken and his family not their safety but their sanity if Ken didn't run that much because he's just he's he needs to burn it off he just has that much energy and the whole concept of energy is something that I'm getting more and more interested in you know as we age we tend to have less energy what is that is it mitochondrial density and function probably but what we're talking about here is a sort of cognitive velocity you know it's not an official term but it's one that I'm using more and more nowadays because I like you know that this um people should try this I'm curious have you've ever done this you sit down to read a page of a book trying to remember the information maybe it's technical maybe it's not and then you flip the page and you try and read a page of the very same book a little bit faster than you're comfortable while trying to retain the information and I find that there's this like sweet spot for reading where kind of like there's a sweet spot for running where going a little faster sometimes actually feels like it requires less effort you know well it's it's interesting that you say that because I actually engage in that exercise quite frequently so um you know I'm constantly reading for my job right if I'm not reading J articles I'm reading books for you know research and I'm doing writing books and the way I do it is often through an audio form and I will put the speed rate up to 2x I'll often go as high as I can go on the app and I can retain a huge amount of information going that fast but it does require that I'm very Vigilant I'm really carefully attending to that audiobook when I'm moving at that speed and so it's it's a it's not I would do on vacation when I'm trying to consume uh a book or information for fun uh you know there I just want to kind of just gently go let the let the paragraphs you know kind of pass my gaze and and take it in slowly and almost even Savor Savor the words on the page but but in other context I do Channel up the velocity and it can be incredibly engaging it can also be depleting so when you have conversations that really you find immensely rewarding and you know cognitive philosophy and I love that term is is is you know a 10 out of 10 when you're done do you ever find it a little tiring not immediately um but my personal challenge in life is um I don't transition States very well so it takes me a little while to drop into a state but then I stay there so I'll come out of here still thinking about it and talking about this to myself or with others for for a fair amount of time maybe on the order of you know half an hour to hours yeah um I've learned this about myself over the years it's it's very effective for Science and for certain things less effective for other areas of life I've learned ways to transition faster but um then I will notice if I do you know record a solo and a guest episode and some intros and stuff in the same week that yeah on on Saturday I'm I'm kind of like my mind feels like it's like white noise and I I've long thought that having I used to call them low cortisol days you know just a day where I'm just kind of like veg and you're more tired probably on those days huh yeah just let myself reset it was actually in my list of questions to ask you about resetting going into kind of a state of wordlessness and just letting things just spool out um for an hour like not trying to control anything not trying to control anything in the universe except you know basic functions right cooking shows prank reals um these are yours these are these are mine and um like I am you know we often take for granted too that the the TV in front of us is a is another emotion regulation device right and actually people who are creating programs are deliberately trying to push your emotions in particular directions from the score that accompanies movies and news and the news so I don't want my emotions being shifted in a Direction that is contrary to my goals right before I go to bed I am at a typically High Velocity level throughout the day starting with physical stuff and exercise to the cognitive stuff and the the politicking and the science talks and all that stuff when I'm finally done going through my email at night I want like a good hour of just total mindless vegetation and it puts me in a wonderfully Serene state to then slide into bed jump into that mental time travel machine like do the fantasizing or saering and then puts me to sleep and so um you know I really value technology there for for helping me do that and I think that is the Counterpoint to having this High Velocity kind of experience I will often when I teach like sometimes I'll teach for like 3 hours so it's you know equivalent to what we're doing right now it is so unbelievably engaging and rewarding and like this is why I got into this business you are you're you know you're having great conversations and you're hopefully like changing the way people think about things getting them um to discover interest all that good stuff couple hours later when I come home first of all I need a little refractory period to switch out of work life into home life which can often be challenging on the personal front cuz like my kids are just waiting there well my youngest kid is waiting there my oldest kid is now in her room doing her own thing but they want to play right away and I I need some time just to de impress but then once I do I've got to lean further into that state and so that's that is Shifting and understanding how to shift that's a different kind of shift but it is all about shifting our states to meet our goals and trying to understand how to do that well and I think that is the subtext to everything that we are talking about here yeah it's such an important aspect of life and I do think that everyone would do well to evaluate fors eles how quickly well not well you know not trying to place a grade on it but how quickly or slowly one transitions into and out of States how much your how much of your thoughts and emotions and um experience you're carrying forward from one context to the next uh I think about that a lot and and I it's something that I I try and work with a lot especially you know arriving home and there's people at home and you you want to engage in a particular way yeah and there there's actually a framework to help people do this that that I really like and it's interesting because you mentioned the military earlier and there's a a wonderful Cory and it's um I have an experien this too often in in my life where I see something in science that scaffolds on to an a a practice that another organization in this case the military implements to help people number one identify what are there in the context of what we're talking about what are their emotion regulation goals what are their shifting goals and how do you go from having those goals to bringing them to fruition and so um so in the military like Special Forces before they have complex complicated operations they will often first think about okay what what's our goal what's the outcome we hope to achieve then what are the obstacles that we can anticipate that might undermine our ability to achieve that goal and they'll go around the room and you know the the person in charge will like cold call IC Style on folks like what is the the um potential obstacle and then for every obstacle that they identify they come up with a very specific if this happens then we will do this and they have multiple if then plans for each of those different obstacles so if we go back to the research landscape there's a technique called whoop have you ever ever heard of this okay so it's whoops an acronym and I promise you I wouldn't use any acronyms but this is a useful one to it's a nemonic to remember something so um how do you go from knowing to doing whoop is designed to help you do that because what it is explicitly designed to do is Target each of the the places where goal Pursuit often breaks down step one what's your wish what's the thing you hope to accomplish let's be really clear about what that goal is we often don't stop to even think about what our specific concrete goals are okay now that we have that that goal let's let's give ourselves some opportunity to energize what is the outcome we hope to achieve if we fulfill that goal and what that's doing is like giving us this motivation now really energizing us to pursue it even further okay we've got the outcome but now let's get let's get realistic what are the obstacles what are the internal obstacles that might prevent me from achieving those goals right so that's why my wish is to to to be present with my family after work the outcome that I hope to achieve is to is to be uh a better father a better husband to have a a a richer social life in those regards now what are the obstacles okay internal obstacles I got plenty right like the temptation to check my email and get to inbox zero before the night is done or I love my science and I also want to do some of that work or maybe I'm going to get distracted by friends who call all of those things are obstacles that might get in the way of me achieving the goal being more present with my family now the final step let me come up with an if then plan if I'm tempted to check my email after 7 or 8 then I'm going to remind myself about how important it is to to be a dad so I'll do a low reframing if if someone calls after 9:00 p.m. and I'm engaging in an activity with with my kids then I'm going to politely Decline and you can imagine coming up with all sorts of plans for different levels of sophistication what those if then plans do is they they they try to make emotion regulation automatic because they identify a specific trigger if that's the if if this happens and then they pair that trigger with a response if then if then you rehearse that and this way when the trigger occurs boom you don't have to stop and think what should I do how should I behave you've got the plan and you implement it I've got if then plans for chatter if the chatter strikes then I do distant selft talk and mental time travel if the chatter is too overwhelming and those two tools don't work then I go to Nature and I go to my chatter advisers and so I have these if then plans that are linked up with my goals and that's a an important technology that I think we can we can invite people to try to exercise in their own lives to make it more likely that they will achieve their regulatory goals I love it so whoop spelled w o p the W if I have this correct is uh what's the goal what's your wish what's your wish the first o is the opportunity to energize yourself around achieving that wish AKA motivation that's right what's the outcome you hope to achieve yep great uh okay even better because what you said was shorter the the first o is what's the outcome you hope to achieve um the second o what are the obstacles you can anticipate that's right and in the research space it's mostly been personal obstacles but you can generalize out as you know uh the Navy Seals do as an example that's the branch of the military I was referring to that essentially uses a similar kind of framework to now you have me self-conscious about using the word optimize to optimize the way they respond on to um missions and challenges uh this is what they so they're not only dealing with internal obstacles obviously but also ones from the world around them don't worry about using the word optimize um you did it optimally and we'll soon Squatch any um pejorative around optimize during this episode and then the p in whoop is the plan an if then plan that's right so it's not a vague plan it's a very specific plan so that you know exactly which strategies and steps to implement should a occur B occur C occur that's right and so it's a general General framework which in part is I think why it has so so much value and there's research behind this showing it can help people achieve various kinds of goals now there of course will be many situations that you have not developed whoops for and that's okay because you're going to have all of these other tools in your toolbox to manage those situations on the fly when they occur but then once you encounter new situations and you discover what tools are effective then you learn you create your whoop and then you can become more strategic automatic and effortless with how you engage them down the road earlier you mentioned attentional spotlights and I'm fascinated by this I know that most people hear that we can't multitask but primates again of which we are old Old World primates in particular can do covert attention if I were not completely focused on you I could focus an attentional spotlight on you and your voice and pay attention to you but I could also monitor components of the room I can merge those spotlights mhm I can divorce those spotlights that's right but it's very hard to generate three kind of compatible attentional spotlights at once it seems like we kind of have two yeah maybe some people can manage three but I'm betting most people can't manage more than three well I think it becomes um especially difficult to manage even one when you're experiencing uh an emotional episode mod that is essentially hijacking your attention and attention is really important to talk about for a few reasons so number one as a species we have the most sophisticated attention deploy deployment system on the planet right we have the ability to strategically deploy our attention so we can we can willfully place it on the things we want or yank it away from the things we don't want or we can go we can sacot our attention back and forth when it comes to emotion though we are often taught certain maxims about how to deploy our attention that I think can sometimes be problematic because they fall into the uh category of prescriptive advice about magic pills so often we hear for example that when it comes to chatter or really big emotions things that you're anxious about or fearful you should not avoid the problem you should focus on it and there's been a lot of research on this and what we have learned is on the one hand chronically avoiding things is not good it's associated with all sorts of negative outcomes for our emotional lives and beyond our physical lives too our health but often times the the signature for adaptively coping with emotional curveballs is being able to focus on the problem at hand deploy your attention elsewhere take a break and then come back to it and so this was a question actually I learned from my grandmother inadvertently my grandmother was this very interesting woman who grew up in um in Poland uh during World War II had her entire family slaughtered during the war one of these kind of devastating experiences lived in the forest uh for years back and forth all this terrible stuff family massacred and so forth and growing up she made it out of the war moved to the states I remember being just so exceptionally curious about what she experienced and how she was able to overcome it and whenever I would ask her questions about this she would ALS she would always say you know don't ask me why or what happened why is a crooked letter that was a phrase she would use which was really interesting because she didn't speak English very well at all heavily accented language but she' mastered this curious ID idiom like why is a crooked letter in other words nothing good comes from dredging up the past or really trying to understand things your life is awesome you're in a safe place you have a loving family just enjoy life so she's trying to shelter me so she for most of the the time that I would know her during the year she would never focus on this horrific event that she experienced except one day a year there would be this this um Remembrance Day and we'd all pile into a a synagogue and we'd talk about or I would listen to them talk about their experiences and the emotions would would come come out so she would dose her exposure to to the emotional information turns out what she was doing is she was being strategic in how she deployed her attention she was focusing on the emotional issue at times when it was productive for her but at other times when it didn't serve her well she occupied her attention with other kinds of thoughts and experiences and a large literature is now beginning to emerge which shows that this capacity to be flexible in how we wield our attention when it comes to sources of emotional struggles can be a really really useful asset and so I think it's important to remind folks that these blunt prescriptions to like always approach a thing a problem or always avoid it they aren't always true and that often the the magic that surrounds emotion regulation I mean the magic not supernaturally but the beauty surrounds get is in being really fasile in how we can deploy our attention really appreciate you sharing that um personal anecdote um I've long struggled with the fact that so many of the sayings that were fed um like you know absence makes the heart grow fonder oh yeah well I also heard out ofsight out of mind so which one is it that's right you know and that's why eventually I became a scientist that's right um because you know it's both right and uh you know and you can see this in the fields of nutrition and exercise I mean there are certain core truths and I think the goal is always to get to those core truths and then there's some flexibility around those truths there's margins of error I I love what she shared you know why is a is a is a crooked letter um it reminds me of the the Bob Dylan Like Don't Look Back you I mean it's an these are profound questions yeah right like how much of our um Consciousness should we use to inforce that we don't spend time thinking about the past and and therefore miss out on the present and creating a a possible future and yet we don't want elements from the past to kind of you know fet into our psyche and then show up in ways that are destructive so it's it's a it's a complicated dance oh it's I mean our emotional eyes are anything but straightforward but we we do have guide posts to steer Us in how we deploy our attention and so so a couple of common her istics uh that I that I I like to use and describe to folks is so let's say say something bad happens and you divert your attention away you distract with a positive distraction not a harmful distraction and then the problem doesn't resurface keep going like you don't have to go back in time there's actually I experienced some friction sometimes with my dad around this issue so my parents were divorced and um you know I dealt with the the baggage surrounding that experience earlier in my life and when I think about it now I don't get upset like I understand why it happened I love both of my parents I've moved on I'm well adjusted but my dad likes to talk about this a lot whenever we speak and he you know we'll often bring it up and when he does I'm like well we don't have to talk about I'm actually totally fine this isn't a source of ongoing distress sometimes we're able to make sense of what has happened to us and move on with our lives and when that happens you know that's our our our cognitive machinery operating really really well we don't have to go back and revisit every single thing if on the other hand we are trying to get a mental break we're distracting and we find thoughts about these experiences continually intruding into our awareness and being distracting that is then a cue okay well let's focus in on it and then once you focus in on it of course there are multiple ways you can engage with that experience sometimes just bathing yourself in the emotional pain can be useful for facilitating a kind of what we would call habituation so getting used to the discomfort and realizing it's not so bad to be in the presence of those negative thoughts maybe you want to reframe how you think about the circumstance and we have wonderful cognitive apparatus to help us reframe things we can look at it from different perspectives we can focus on the silver lining we can contextualize it so you have lots of tools to engage with things once you refocus but you don't always need to refocus focus on the problem so you want to be flexible flexibility in how you deploy your attention is really the Mantra that that I personally live by based on what I know of how all of this works there are a couple of caveats I want to throw out there when I'm talking about distraction and and avoiding I'm talking about healthy distractions healthy avoidance there are unhealthier forms of avoidance that we know definitively are are are not productive like substance abuse we also know that if you adopt a blunt rule of always just chronically avoiding not good so you want to be balanced could we add to the list of um tools for avoidance that tend to be unhealthy and this isn't one that I default to but I know someone that told me that um she us to default into um overc consumption of of story like of of of audio books not that audiobooks are bad but you know fiction audio books and just kind of when when there was a problem rather than dealing with the problem you know overindulgence in in narratives that would just kind of consume the mind I guess any Behavior where we're not um dealing with the the kind of uh itch that we probably need to scratch at least for a short while yeah it's probably going to be maladaptive in the long run yeah I mean if the problem keeps like you want to be you want to listen to what your mind and body are are telling you and so if you find that the problem keeps resurfacing that's a q you need to engage and deal with it but a lot of the the experiences we have on a daily basis which may not be positive negative experiences as time moves on sometimes that's all we need to keep going with our lives and we do see in the literature that when you impose a particular view on folks like you have to do it this way that tends not to work out very well most of what we've been discussing today is one's emotional life and experience and chatter and inner narratives with oneself and their environment um technology nature and to some extent relationships but one powerful aspect of emotions that I think a lot of people wonder about and frankly participate in is this notion of emotional contagion yeah both positive and negative uh I think of like us you mentioned football football's being in Michigan right oh yeah I remember from the movie The Big Chill they like actually go play for that was I think they were all Alum of of University of Michigan it's it's a religion in in the city that I live in that's right is it right okay um and how many people go to one of these games so we actually it's called the big house actually the largest football stadium in in the country um so close to 110,000 waa that's a lot of people it's a lot of people and we sing in unison and um it's actually I I never really was into football before moving to an arbor and now I embrace it um it helps when you're the national championships which we were Champions which we were last year congratulations we're working we're working on it this year um cool maybe sometime I'll go to a game I'm I'm not a I don't dislike football I like football I don't think I've ever been to a to a professional football game oh you should we should definitely have you out there it is a load of fun okay I'll I'll Skip One game of the globe troter season to to go to uh Michigan a Michigan game um emotional contagion occurs in football stadiums occurs in digesting news we just had an election so a lot of emotional contagion in essentially opposite directions post elction um and on and on what do we know about emotional contagion it makes sense to me why we we would be so prone to it but where are the the the sort of rumble strips um so to speak and the ditch on emotional contagion yeah that's a driving analogy the rumble strips are the that when you start to drift towards the ditch yeah uh you know obviously the ditch is losing control in the negative Direction Mal adaptive Direction but like how can we start to identify the the rumble strips in in emotional contagion yeah so emotional contagion is a very powerful phenomenon um uh emotions can spread within seconds um they tend to uh we tend to catch emotions more quickly when we're not sure of how we should be thinking or feeling in a particular situation so we often are referencing other people in those instances as a source of information the people around us of course are a rich source of information this is also why we compare ourselves to other people so frequently right we're trying to learn something about how to respond and we know it can have these cascading effects both in everyday life in both the positive and the negative Direction but also um you know in in in the digital world we see these emotions that can spread really fast too so it's a it's a very powerful phenomenon it's one I'm often very attentive to when I come into the classroom like you're trying to you tend to not want to have a negative mood spread through an audience when you are teaching to them and so you're sensitive to that kind of certain kinds of displays or tones that might convey that kind of emotional response um and I think it's something that we need to be incre increasingly aware of especially when we're working in in any kind of group context like when you're working on a team it is really important to keep the team at the level of emotional tone that you feel if you're the leader or even a just a member of this team that is committed to it you want to keep that tone at the most productive level because if it dips below or above that can sabotage how um how well you perform and there's a lot of research on that both from directing my laboratory for a good number of years and from teaching and from certainly the podcast which is a small team of seven of us um I'm familiar with what you just described and um also for being a camp counselor that's probably where I learned it being a summer camp counselor when I was in college yeah that if you get um two or three kids that are like really pissed off about what you have to do over the next couple of hours it can send everything and you have to nip that in the bud right away you have to repair that and I'm I'm very very attentive to this when I am in group context especially when I'm leading those groups those teams those labs like really making sure that that kind of negative Mojo does not does not spread do you think nowadays um on University campuses there's a more of a tendency for students to raise their hands and say like let's spark an issue um and I'll just preface this by saying a a guy that I worked for as an undergraduate um a physiologist he told me that when he was teaching during the Vietnam War era he would be in the middle of a lecture about cold thermogenesis physiology his area of expertise and someone would just stand up and say what about the war in Vietnam and I remember him telling me that story I thought that's outrageous like really he said oh yeah all the time and you would have to stop and have to acknowledge it and let them have their expression I thought well that's wild now we we're living in times when um that's not all that unusual uh in the University classroom and on campuses so and online so you know it's interesting that that previous example from the 1960s now very relevant again so um do we let people emote or you know as a summer camp counselor someone pulled me aside and said you these kids have a lot of energy my only advice is be a channel not a dam something I never forgot yeah it's very useful in other areas of life too be a channel not a dam yeah um so how do you be a channel not a dam when people are having um really have the need to uh externalize negative stuff and it holds the potential for for emotional contagion well you know I haven't experienced firsthand the phenomenon that you're describing in the classroom but obviously a lot of my colleagues have and we see this playing out on lots of universities these are very turbulent times turbulence activates and we know going back to an earlier part of our conversation when people experience strong emotions are often motivated to share those emotions with other people that often takes the form of vocalizing them and that can elicit contagion throughout and so now we're beginning to actually understand how the emotional processes are are making their way through people groups and societies um what should you do in those circumstances well I think it depends a lot on on the context and and what the nature of the emotional response is and are there you know is the emotion becoming really counterproductive or harmful and you know there are differing views about when you should intervene and how to do it I think in general though you bring the um the Playbook of always wanting to kind of validate like your emotional experience is a genuine response that you are having to the situation in in most cases yes we can try to purposefully experience an emotion in a duplicitous way but I think in a lot of cases the kinds of phenomena we're talking about like these are just honest emotional reactions these are really difficult times and I think um trying to understand where those emotions are coming from is often a really great first step I mentioned to you before we started talking that I I had a this wonderful um conflict mediator come to one of my classes recently to talk about how do you not just engage with emotional groups but how do you engage with emotional groups at the same time that are having emotions because of one another and the approach that she has found to be be very successful in her career as a mediator is to ask folks to train them not to enter conversations to try to change each other's minds but to enter those conversations with a a state of humility and curiosity and genuine interest and in first and foremost trying to just understand the other group's position I haven't done that myself but it it it strikes me as a as a pretty viable approach to a first step to having conversations about difficult issues and you know it it makes me think about how in the lab we often define wisdom so wisdom is this concept of it indexes how well you are able to deal with social situations involving uncertainty like we don't know how these social situations are going to play out and wise individuals are skillful in navigating those circumstances how do you define wisdom what are its features well a few of its core features are humility recognizing that I don't know everything a commitment to perspective taking putting myself in the other person's shoes um dialecticism recognizing that the world is constantly in flux and circumstances are changing and we need to be aware of that and then also a general orientation towards the social good like doing good in the world and it strikes me that entering these difficult situations with that kind of mindset is potentially productive for um for bridging divides I love that and um what an appropriate area for us to round up in I think that right now clearly things are are tense but um what you've talked about today and uh at least from what I understand of how the human mind works in and around emotions our own and observing others and potentially contagion is that these tools can really help us do better uh that they're not just research papers they are uh implementable uh chunks of knowledge and in some cases such as what you've discussed today real gems uh so for that reason and for taking the time out of your research schedule I mean your researcher teacher your dad your husband you do many things you make it to football game somehow also into the gym uh where you don't drop dumbbells on people's faces intentionally um because you realize the dire consequences you you're just doing a ton of amazing work in the world I'd heard about and read chatter some time ago and yeah I just think it's it's incredible what you've brought to people's attention that has always no pun intended been on and in their minds yeah you know and I'm sure there are others in your field um but I want to specifically thank you on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching for paying so much careful research attention and public education attention to this thing that we call chatter and the inner voice and emotion regulation because this is really what makes up our lives it's as important in my mind certainly as cardiovascular health or any other aspect of mental or physical health so on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching thank you so much please come back again because your research is evolving we'd love to hear about the next steps we'll definitely provide links to your work and to the upcoming book which comes out in February of 2025 do you want to tell us the title of the book that's right it's called shift managing your emotions so they don't manage you great and presumably it's available for pre-sale now or soon yeah it's it's available and um it is uh it is essentially designed it is written to um to kind of just open the open the book on what emotions are what we often get wrong about them and what are the tools that we have to re them in and uh you know my hope is that IT addresses this big problem that I think we've been facing for a while just how to Wrangle these emotions that sometimes get the best of us great well uh I am personally going to order a copy by pre-sale I insist on that I don't take free copies I I I bu books cuz I'm a Believer in books so thank you for writing shift and come back and talk to us again well thanks for having me it was an incredible conversation so I appreciate it feel the same way thank you so much thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr Ethan cross I hope you found it to be as informative and as actionable as I did to learn more about Dr cross's work and to find links to his

Title: How to Improve at Learning Using Neuroscience & AI | Dr. Terry Sejnowski
Published: 2024-11-18 13:00:56 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Terry Sejnowski, Ph.D., professor of computational neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He is world-renowned for exploring how our brain processes and stores information and, with that understanding, for developing tools that enable us to markedly improve our ability to learn all types of information and skills.

We discuss how to learn most effectively in order to truly master a subject or skill. Dr. Sejnowski explains how to use AI tools to forage for new information, generate ideas, predict the future, and assist in analyzing health data and making health-related decisions.

We also explore non-AI strategies to enhance learning and creativity, including how specific types of exercise can improve mitochondrial function and cognitive performance. Listeners will gain insights into how computational methods and AI are transforming our understanding of brain function, learning, and memory, as well as the emerging roles of these tools in addressing personal health and treating brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Terry snowski Dr Terry snowski is a professor at the sulk Institute for biological studies where he directs the computational neurobiology laboratory and as his title suggests he is a computational neuroscientist that is he uses math as well as artificial intelligence and Computing methods to understand this overarching Ultra important question of how the brain works now I realize that when people hear terms like computational Neuroscience algorithms large language models and AI that it can be a bit overwhelming and even intimidating but I assure you that the purpose of Dr sow's work and indeed today's discussion is all about using those methods to clarify how the brain works and indeed to simplify the answer to that question so for instance today you will learn that regardless of who you are regardless of your experience that all your motivation in all domains of life is governed by a simple algorithm or equation Dr snowski explains how a single rule a single learning rule drives all of our motivation related behaviors and it of course relates to the neurom modulator dopamine and if you're familiar with dopamine as a term today you will really understand how dopamine Works to drive your levels of motivation or in some cases lack of motivation and how to overcome that lack of motivation today we also discuss how best to learn Dr sinowski shares not just information about how the brain works but also practical tools that he and colleagues have developed including a zeroc cost online portal that teaches you how to learn better based on your particular learning style the way that you in particular Forge for information and Implement that information Dr snowski also explains how he himself uses physical exercise of a particular type in order to enhance his cognition that is his brain's ability to learn information and to come up with new ideas today we also discuss both the healthy brain and the diseased brain in conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and how particular tools that relate to mitochondrial function can perhaps be used in order to treat various diseases including Alzheimer's dementia I'm certain that by the end of today's episode you will have learned a tremendous amount of new knowledge about how your brain works and practical tools that you can Implement in your daily life before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is betterhelp better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out completely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years and initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to one's overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every single week now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about essentially all issues that you want to second of all great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support or simply directed guidance what to do or what not to do in given areas of your life and third expert therapy can provide you useful insights that you would not have been able to arrive at on your own better help makes it very easy to find an expert therapist who you really resonate with and that can provide you the benefits I just mentioned that come with effective therapy if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in terms of the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft it is or how firm it is how breathable it is all play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress the US I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about 3 and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a match that is customized for your unique sleep needs for the month of November 2024 Helix is giving up to 25% off on all mattress orders and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get up to 25% off and two free pillows and now for my discussion with Dr Terry sinowski Dr Terry sinowski welcome great to be here we go way back and I'm a huge huge fan of your work because you've worked on a great many different things in the field of Neuroscience you're considered by many a computational neuroscience so you bring mathematical models to an understanding of the brain and neural networks and we're also going to talk about AI today and we're going to make it accessible for everybody biologist or no math background or no to kick things off I want to understand something I understand a bit about the parts list of the brain and most listeners of this podcast will understand a little bit of the parts list of the brain even if they've never heard an episode of this podcast before because they understand there are cells those cells are neurons those neurons connect to one another in very specific ways that allow us to see to hear to think Etc but I've come to the belief that even if we know the parts list it doesn't really inform us how the brain works right this is the big question how does the brain work what is consciousness all of this stuff so where and how does an understanding of how neurons talk to one another start to give us a real understanding about like how the brain works like what is this piece of meat in our heads because it can't just be okay the hippocampus remembers stuff and the you know the visual cortex perceives stuff when you sit back and you remove the math from the mental conversation if that's possible for you how do you think about quote unquote how the brain works like at a very basic level what is this piece of meat in our heads really trying to accomplish from let's just say the time when we first wake up in the morning and we're a little groggy till we make it to that first cup of coffee or water or maybe even just to urinate first thing in the morning what is going on in there what a great question and um you you know the I have a u Pat church and I wrote a book computational Brain and in it there's this levels diagram uh and it at levels of Investigation at different spatial scales from molecular at the very bottom to synapses and neurons circuits neural circuits how they're connected with each other and then brain areas in the cortex and then the whole central nervous system span 10 orders of magnitude you know 10th to the 10th in spatial scale so you know where is consciousness in all of that so uh there are two approaches that neuroscientists have taken uh I shouldn't say neuroscientist I should say that scientist had taken uh and the one you describe which is you know let's look at all the parts that's the bottomup approach you know take it apart and reductionist approach and you make a lot of progress you can figure out you know how things are connected and and understand how development Works how neurons connect but it's very difficult to really make progress because uh you quickly you get lost in the forest now the other approach which has been successful um but at the end unsatisfying is the top down approach and and this is the approach that psychologists have taken looking at behavior and trying to understand you know the the the the laws of behavior this is the behaviorists uh but you know even people in AI were trying to do a top down to write programs that could replicate human behavior intelligent Behavior and I have to say that both of those approaches you know bottom up or top down have really not gotten to the core of answering any of those questions the big questions but there's a whole new approach now that is emerging in both neuroscience and AI at exactly the same time at this moment in history it's really quite remarkable so there's an intermediate level between the implementation level at the bottom how you implement some particular uh mechanism uh and the the the actual behavior of the whole system is called the algorithmic level it's in between so algorithms are like recipes they're like you know when you bake a cake you have to have uh ingredients and you have to say how the order in which they're put together and how long and you know if you if you if you get it wrong you know it doesn't work you know the the it's just a mess now it turns out that we're discovering algorithms we've made a lot of progress with understanding the algorithms that are used in neural circuits and this U speaks to the computational level of of how to understand you know the function of the neural circuit but uh I'm going to give you one example of an algorithm which uh is is one we worked on back in the 1990s when um Peter de and Reed monu or postto in the lab and it had to do with a part of the brain below the cortex called the basal ganglia which is responsible for learning sequences of actions in order to achieve some goal for example if you want to play tennis you know you have to be able to coordinate many muscles and a whole sequence of actions has to be made if you want to be able to serve accurately and you have to practice practice practice well what's going on there is that the basil ganglia basically is taking over from the cortex and producing actions that get better and better and better and better and that's true not just of the the muscles but it's also true of thinking if you want to become good in any area if you want to become a a good uh Finance here if you want to get become a good doctor or a neuroscientist right you you you have to be uh practicing practicing practic iing in terms of understanding what uh you know what what's uh the details of the profession and what works what doesn't work and so forth and and it turns out that the basal ganglia interacts with the cortex not just in the back which is the action part but also with the prefrontal cortex which is the thinking part can I ask you a question about this briefly the basil ganglia as I understand are involved in the um organization of two major types of behaviors go meaning to actually perform a behavior but the basil ganglia also instruct noo don't don't engage in that behavior and learning a an expert golf swing or even a basic golf swing or tennis racket swing involves both of those things go and no- go given what you just said which is that the basil ganglia are also involved in generating thoughts of particular kinds I wonder therefore if it's also involved in suppression of thoughts of particular kinds I mean you don't want your surgeon cutting into um you know a particular uh region and just thinking about their motor behaviors what to do and what not to do they presumably need to think about what to think about but also what to not think about you don't want that um surgeon thinking about how their kid was a brat that morning and um and they're frustrated because the two things interact so is there go no- go in terms of action and learning and is there go noo in terms of thinking well I mentioned the prefontal cortex and that part the loop with the basil G that is one of the last to mature in uh you know early adulthood and you know what the problem is that for adolescence it's not the no-go part for for you know planning and actions isn't quite there yet and so often it doesn't kick in to to prevent you from doing things that are not in your best interest so yes absolutely right but one of the things though is that learning is involved and and this is really so a problem that we cracked first theoretically in the 90s and then experimentally later by recording from neurons and also brain Imaging in humans so it turns out we know the algorithm that is used in the brain for how to learn sequences of actions to achieve a goal uh and and it's a simplest possible algorithm you can imagine it's simply to predict the next reward you're going to get if I if I do an action well I will it be a give me something of value and uh and you learn every time you try something whether you got the amount of reward you expected or less you use that to update the synapses synaptic plasticity so that the next time you'll have a better chance of getting a a better reward and you build up what's called a value function so the cortex now over your lifetime is building up a a lot of knowledge about you know things that are good for you things that are bad for you like you go to a restaurant you order something how do you know what's good for you right you've had lots of meals in a lot of places and now that is part of your value function this is the same algorithm that was used by Alpha go this is the program that deep mine built this is an AI program that beat the world go champion and go is the most complex game that humans have ever come uh played you know on a regular basis far more complex than chess as I understand yeah that's right so uh go is to chess where chess is to something like Che Checkers you know other words the level of difficulty is another you way off above it because you have to think in terms of of of battles going on all over the place at the same time and the order in which you put the pieces down are going to affect what's going to happen in the future so this value function is super interesting and I wonder whether and I think answer this but I wonder whether this value function is implemented over long periods of time so you talked about the value function in terms of learning a motor skill let's say swinging a tennis racket to do a perfect tennis surf or or even just a decent tennis surf when somebody goes back to the court let's say on the weekend once a month over the course of years are they able to tap into that same value function every time they go back even though there's been a lot of intervening time and learning that's question number one and then the other question is do you think that this value function is also being played out in more complex scenarios not just motor learning such as let's say a domain of life that for many people involves some um trial and error it would be like human relationships we learn how to be friends with people uh we learn how to be a good sibling uh we learn how to be a good romantic partner right we get some things right we get some things wrong so is the same value function being implemented we're paying attention to what was rewarding but what I didn't hear you say also was what was punishing so are we only paying attention to what is rewarding or we're also integrating punishment we don't get an electric shock when we get the serve wrong but we can be frustrated what you identified is um some a very uh important feature uh which is that rewards uh by the way you know every time you do something you're updating this value function every time and and it accumulates and the answer to your first question the answer is that it's always going to be there it doesn't matter it's it's a very permanent part of your experience and who you are and uh and interestingly and and the behaviorist knew this back in the 1950s that uh you can get there two ways of trial and error you know small rewards are good because you're constantly coming closer and closer to getting the uh what you're seeking better tennis player or being able to make a friend but the negative punishment is much more effective one trial learning you don't need to have you know 100 trials to you know what you need you know when you're training a rat to to do some task with small food rewards but if you if you just shock the rat boy that rat doesn't forget that yeah one really bad relationship will have you have you learning certain things forever and this is also PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder is is another good example of that that can screw you up for the rest of your life so so but the other thing and and you you pointed out something really important which is that a large part of the prefrontal cortex is devoted to social interaction and this is how humans you know when you come into the world you don't know what language you're going to be speaking you don't know what the cultural values are that you're that you're going to have to be able to become a member of this society and things that are expected of you all of that has to become through experience through building this value function so this is and this is something we discovered in the 20th century and and now it's going into AI it's called reinforcement learning in AI it's a it's a form of procceed ual learning as opposed to the cognitive level where you think and you do things cognitive thinking is much less efficient uh because you have to go step by step with procedural learning uh it's automatic can you give me an example of procedural learning in the context of um a comparison to cognitive learning like is there an example of perhaps like how to make a decent cup of coffee using uh you know purely knowledge-based learning versus procedural learning where procedural learning wins and I I I can imagine one but you're the true expert here well you know no you know a lot of examples but uh my my just since we've been talking about tennis can you imagine learning how to play tennis through a book reading a book that's so funny on the plane back from Nashville yesterday the guy sitting across the aisle from me was reading a book about um uh maybe he was working on his pilot's license or something and I I looked over and couldn't but notice these diagrams of the of the plane flying and I thought I'm just so glad that this guy is a passenger and not and not a pilot and then I thought about how the pilots learned and presumably it was a combination of practical learning and textbook learning I me when you scuba dive this is true I'm scuba dive certified and when you get your certification you you learn your dive tables and you learn why you have to wait between Dives Etc and gas exchange and a number of things but there's really no way to simulate what is to take your mask off underwater put it back on and then you know blow the water out of your mask like that you just have to do that in a pool and you actually have to do it when you need to for it to really get drilled in yes you you you you you uh it's really essential for things that uh have to be executed quickly and and uh expertly to to get that you know really down path so you don't have to think uh and this happens in school right in other words you you you you have classroom lessons where you're given explicit instruction but then you go do homework that's procedural learning you do problems you solve problems and and you know I'm I'm a PhD physicist so I I I went through all of the classes you know in theoretical physics and um it was really the problems that really were the core of becoming a good physicist you know you can memorize the equations but that doesn't mean you understand how to use the equations I think it's worth highlighting something a lot of times on this podcast we talk about what I call protocols it would be you know like get some morning sunlight in your eyes to stimulate your supermatic nucleus by way of your retinal gangling cells audiences of this podcast will recognize those terms it's basically get sunlight in your eyes in the morning and set your circadian clock that's right and you can hear that a trillion times but I do believe that there's some value to both knowing what the protocol is the underlying mechanisms there are these things in your eye that you know encode the sunrise qualities of light it's Etc and then send them to your brain etc etc but then once we link knowledge pure knowledge to a practice I do believe that the two things merge someplace in a way that um let's say reinforces both the knowledge and the practice right so these things are not necessarily separate they bridge in other words doing your theoretical physics uh problem sets reinforces the examples that you learned in lecture and in your textbooks and vice versa so this is a battle that's going on right now in schools uh you're you know what you've just said is absolutely right you need both we have two major Learning Systems we have a cognitive learning system which is cortical we have a procedural learning system which is subcortical basil gangli and the two go hand in hand if you want to become good at anything that the two are going to help each other and what's going on right now in schools in California at least is that they're trying to get rid of the procedural that's ridiculous they don't want students to practice because it it's it's going to be uh you know you're you're stressing them that you don't want them to be to feel that you know that they're having difficulty so but we can but for those listening I'm covering my eyes because I mean this would this would be like saying um goodness there's so many examples like here's a textbook on swimming and then you're you're going to go out to the ocean someday and you will have never actually swam right and now you're expected to be able to survive let alone swim well it's crazy it's crazy but I'll tell you Barbara Oakley um has uh and I have a a moo massive open online course on learning how to learn and it helps students we aimed it at students but it actually has been taken by four million people in 200 countries ages 10 to 90 what is this called learning how to learn is it uh is there a pay wall no it's free completely free amazing and uh and you know I get incredible you know feedback uh you know faman letters almost every day well you're about to get a few more okay I did an episode on learning how to learn and my understanding of the research is that we need to test ourselves on the material the testing is not just a form of evaluation it is a form of uh identifying the the errors that help us then compensate for the errors and learn but it but it's it's very procedural it's not about just listen and regurgitating you you're you know you put your finger on it which is that and this is what we teach the students is that you have to uh there there the the way the brain works right is is not it doesn't memorize things like a computer but you you have to it has to be active learning you have to actively engage in fact um when you're you're trying to solve a problem on your own right this is where you're really learning by trial and error and that's procedural system if someone tells you what the right answer is you know you know that's just something that is a fact that it gets stored away somewhere but it's not going to automatically come up if you actually are faced with something that's not exactly the same problem but it's similar and by the way this is the key to AI completely uh essential for the recent success of of these uh large language models you know that the public now is beginning to use is that they're they're not parrots they just they're not they just don't memorize what they what they've the data that they've taken in they have to generalize that means to be able to do well on new things that come in that are similar to the old things that you've seen But allow you to solve new problems that's the key to the brain that the brain is a really really good at generalizing in fact in many cases you only need one example to generalize like going to a restaurant for the first time there are a number of new interactions right there might be a host or a Hostess you sit down at these tables you've never sat at somebody asks you questions you read it okay maybe it's a QR code these days but right um Forever After you understand the process of going into a restaurant doesn't matter what the genre of food happens to be or what city sitting inside or outside you can pretty much work it out sit at the counter sit outside sit at the table it's there a number of key action steps that I think pretty much translate to everywhere unless you go to some super high-end thing or some super lowend thing where it's a buffet or whatever you know you can start to fill in the blanks here if I understand correctly there's a an action function that's learned from the knowledge and the experience exactly and then where is that action function stored is it in one location in the brain or is it kind of an emergent property of multiple brain areas so that you're right at the cusp here of uh where we are in Neuroscience right now we don't know the answer to that question in the past it had been thought that uh you know the the cortex had uh were like uh countries on uh uh that Each of which each part of the cortex was dedicated to one function right uh you know there and and interestingly you record for the neurons and it certainly looks that way right in other words the there's a visual cortex in the back and there's a whole series of areas then there's the auditory cortex in the here in the middle and then the prefrontal cortex for social interaction and and so it looked really clearcut that it's modular and now we're facing is by uh we have a new way to record from neurons optically we can record from tens of thousands from dozens of areas simultaneously and what we're discovering is that if you want to do any task you're engaging not just the area that you might think you know has the input coming in the visual system but the visual system is getting input from the motor system right in fact you know there's more input coming from the motor system than from the eye really yes yeah an churchin at UCLA has shown that in the mouse uh this is so now we're looking at Global interactions between all these areas and that's where real uh complex cognitive behaviors emerge is from those interactions and now we have the tools for the first time to actually be able to see them in real time and and we're we're doing that now U First on uh mice and monkeys but uh we now can do this in humans so I've been collaborating with a group at Mass General Hospital to record from people with epilepsy and and they have to have an operation for people who are drug resistant to be able to uh take out find out where it starts in the cortex you know and and where is initiated where the seizure starts and then to go in you have to go in and record simultaneously from a lot of parts of the cortex for weeks until you find out where it is and then you go in and you try to uh take it out and and often that helps very very invasive but for two weeks we have access to all those neurons in that cortex that are being you know recorded from constantly and so I've used I started out because I was interested in sleep and I wanted to understand what happens in in the cortex of a human during sleep but then we be realized that you know you can also figure you know people who have these debilitating problems with seizures you know they're there for two weeks and they have nothing to do so they just love the fact that scientists are interested in helping them and and you know teaching them things and finding out where in the cortex uh things are happening when they learn something this is a gold mine it's it's unbelievable and I I've I've learned things from humans that could I could have never gotten from any other species amazing obviously language is one of them but there are other things in sleep that uh We've we discovered having to do with traveling ways there are circular traveling ways that go on during sleep which is astonishing nobody ever really uh saw that before but uh if you were to ascribe one or two major functions to these traveling waves what do you think they are accomplishing for us in sleep and by the way are they associated with deep sleep slow wave sleep or with rapid ey movement sleep or this is uh this is uh non-rm sleep this is a jargon this is uh during uh intermediate transition States the transition state okay our audience will probably keep they've they've heard a lot about slow wave sleep from me and Matt Walker from Rapid ey light slow a sleep yeah and so what do these traveling waves accomplish for us okay so in the case of the they're called sleep spindles they last the waves last for about u a second or two um and and they travel like I say in a circle around the cortex and it's known that these spindles are important for consolidating experiences you've had during the day into your long-term memory storage so so it's a very important function and if if if you take out see it's the hippocampus that is is is is replaying the experience is it's a part of the brain is very important for long-term memory if you don't have a hippocampus you can't learn new things that to say you can't remember what you did the yesterday or for that matter even an hour earlier but the hippocampus plays back your experiences causes the sleep spindles now to knead that into the cortex and and it you it's important you do that right because you don't want to overwrite the existing knowledge you have you just want to basically incorporate the new experience into your exist existing knowledge base in an efficient way that uh that doesn't interfere with what you already know so that's an example of of very important function that these traveling wavs have I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that includes prebiotics and adaptogens I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing at a time when my budget was really Limited in fact I only had enough money to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat Whole Foods and unprocessed Foods it's very difficult to get enough vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from diet alone in order to make sure that I'm at my best meaning have enough energy for all the activities I participate in from morning until night sleeping well at night and keeping my immune system strong when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health my performance recovery from exercise all of those improve and I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take my ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also noticed and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only November 2024 ag1 is giving away a free one-month supply of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in addition to their usual welcome kit of five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 as I've discussed many times before on this podcast omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain health mood cognition and more again go to drink a1.com huberman to claim this special offer today's episode is also brought To Us by David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 gram of protein only 150 calories and 0 gam of sugar that's right 28 gr of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein the These Bars from David also taste amazing my favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough but then again I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one and I also like the cake flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're incredibly delicious for me personally I strive to eat mostly Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source with David I'm able to get 28 g of protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and it allows me to do that without taking in excess calories I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon or even midafternoon if I want to bridge that gap between lunch and dinner I like that it's a little bit sweet so it tastes like a tasty snack but it's also giv me that 28 gram of very high quality protein with just 150 calories if you would like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is david.com huberman as I call there are one or two things that one can do in order to ensure that one gets sufficient sleep spindles at night and thereby incorporate this new knowledge this was from the episode that we did with Gina Po from UCLA I believe and others including Matt Walker my recollection is that the number one thing is to make sure you get enough sleep at night so you experience enough of these spindles and we're all familiar with the um cognitive challenges including memory challenges and learning challenges associated with with lack of sleep insufficient sleep but the other was that um there was some interesting relationship between daytime exercise and nighttime prevalence of sleep spindles are you familiar with that literature oh yes no this is a this is a fascinating literature uh and it's all pointing the same direction which is that you know we always neglect to uh appreciate the importance of sleep I mean obviously you're refreshed when you wake up but there's a lot of things happen it's not that your brain turns off it's that it goes into a completely different state and and memory consolidation is just one of those things that happens when you're fall asleep and of course you you know there's dreams and so forth we don't fully appreciate or understand exactly how all the different sleep stages are are uh work together but uh exercis is a particularly important part of of of getting uh the motor uh system uh uh tuned up and and that it's thought that the uh this the REM rapid eye movement sleep may be involved in that so that that's a that's yet another part of the Sleep uh stages you go through you go back and forth between um dream sleep and the slow way sleep back and forth back and forth during the night and then at the when you wake up you're in the in the REM stage more and more REM more and more REM but you know that's all observation but we you know as a scientist what you want to do is perturb the system and and see if you can maybe if you had more sleep spindles maybe you'd be able to remember things better so it turns out Sarah mednick who was at UC Irvine did this fantastic experiment so it turns out there's a drug called zulum which um is is goes by the the name ambian you may have some experience with that if I've never taken it but um I'm I'm aware of what is people use it as a sleep aid that's right it's it's it a lot of people take it in order to sleep okay uh well it turns out that it causes uh more sleep spindles really yeah it it doubles the number of sleep spindles if you you know if you take the drug uh you take the drug uh after you've done the learning right you do the learning at night and then you take the drug and you have twice as many spindles you wake up in the morning you can remember twice as much from what you learned and the memories are stable over time it's like it's in there yes yeah no it's it's it it it consolidates it I mean that's the point is what's the downside of ambient okay here's the downside okay so people who take the drug say if you're going uh to Europe and you take it and then you sleep really soundly but often you you find yourself in the hotel room and you completely have no clue you have no memory of how you got there had that experience without ambian or any other drugs where I am very badly jetlagged yes and I wake up and for a few seconds but what feels like eternity I have no idea where I am okay it's terrifying that well that that's another problem that you have with jet lag jet lag really screws things up but this is something where it could be an hour you know you you you took the train or you you took a taxi or something and you're and so here here now this seems crazy how could it be a a way to improve learning and recall on one hand and then forgetfulness on the other hand well it turns out what's important is um that when you take the drug right uh in other words it helps consolidate experiences you've had in the past before you took the drug but it will wipe out experiences you have in the future after you take the drug right yeah you Ste sorry I'm not laughing it must be a terrifying experience but I'm laughing because you know there's some beautiful pharmacology and indeed some um wonderfully useful uh Pharmaceuticals out there uh you know some people may cringe to hear me say that but there are some very useful drugs out there that save lives and help people deal with symptoms Etc um side effects are always a concern but this particular drug profile ambian that is um seems to reveal something perhaps even more important than discussion about spindles or ambient or even sleep which is that you got to pay the piper somehow as they say that's right that you tweak one thing in the brain something else uh something else goes you you you don't get anything for free that's a TR I think that this is something that uh is true not just of drugs for the brain but steroids for the body right sure yeah I mean steroids um even lowd dose testosterone therapy which is very popular nowadays um will give people more Vigor Etc but it is introducing a sort of um second puberty and puberty is perhaps the most rapid phase of Aging in the entire lifespan same thing with people take growth hormone would be probably a better example because certainly those therapies can be beneficial to people but growth hormone gives people more Vigor but it accelerates aging look at the quality of skin that people have when they take growth hormone it looks more aged they physically change and I'm not for or against these things it's highly individual but I completely agree with you I I would also Venture that um with the growing interest in um so-called neut tropics and people taking things like modafanil not just for narcolepsy daytime sleepiness but also to enhance cognitive function okay maybe they can get away with doing that every once in a while for a a deadline task or something but my experience is that people who obsess over the use of pharmacology to achieve certain brain States pay in some other way absolutely whether or not stimulants or sedatives or sleep drugs and that behaviors will always Prevail behaviors will always Prevail as tools yeah and and uh the one of the things about the way the body evolved is that it's it's it really has to balance a lot of things and so with drugs you're basically unbalancing it somehow and and and the consequence is as you point out is that you know what what in order to make uh one part better one part of your body or you you sacrifice something else somewhere else as long as we're talking about brain States and um connectivity across areas um I want to ask a particular question then I want to return to this issue about how best to learn especially in kids but also in adulthood um I've become very interested in and spent a lot of time with the literature and some guests on the topic of psychedelics um let's leave the discussion about LSD aside because do you know why there aren't many studies of LSD this is kind of a fun one no one is expected to know against the law I think oh but there's so is sosy in her MDMA and there are lots of studies going on about those yeah changed but when I was growing up you know as you know it was against the law right so that what I learned is that the that there are far fewer clinical trials exploring the use of LSD as a therapeutic because with the exception of Switzerland none of the researchers are willing to stay in the laboratory as long as it takes for the subject to get through an LSD Journey whereas psilocybin tends to be a shorter a shorter experience okay let's talk about psilocybin from a moment my read of the data on psilocybin is that it's still open to question but that some of the clinical trials show pretty significant recovery from major depression is pretty impressive but if we just set that aside and say okay more needs to be worked out for safety what is very clear from the brain Imaging studies that sort before and after resting state task related Etc is that you get more resting State Global connectivity more areas talking to more areas than was the case prior to the use of the Psychedelic and given the similarity of the Psychedelic journey and here specifically talking about psilocybin to things like rapid eye movement sleep and things of that sort I have a very simple question do you think that there's any real benefit to increasing brainwide connectivity to me it seems a little bit halfhazard and yet the clinical data are promising if nothing else promising and so is what we're seeking in life as we acquire new knowledge as we learn tennis or golf or you know take up singing or what have you as we go from childhood into the late stages of our life that whole transition is what we're doing increasing connectivity and communication between different brain areas is that what the Human Experience is really about or is it that we're getting more modular we're getting more segregated in terms of this area talking to this area in this particular way um feel free to explore this in any way that feels meaningful or to say pass if it's not a good question no it's a great question I mean you have all these great questions and we don't have complete answers yet but uh specifically with regard to connectivity um if you look at what happens in an infant's brain during the first two years there's a tremendous amount of new synapses being formed this is your area by the way you know more about this than I do yeah that's true but then you prune them right there's then the second phase is that you over abundant synapses and now what you want to do is to prune them why would you want to do that well you know synapses are expensive it's talk takes a lot of uh of energy to activate all of the neurons and the synapses especially because there's the turnover of the neurotransmitter and so what you want to do is to uh reduce the amount of energy and only use those synapses that have been proven to be the most important right now unfortunately as you get older you you have the pruning slows down but doesn't go away so the cortex Thins and and so forth so I think it's goes in the opposite direction I think that as you get older you you you're losing connectivity but you you retain interestingly you retain the old memories the old memories are are really rock solid because they were put in when you were young yeah the foundation the foundation upon which everything else is built uh but but it's not totally uh one way in in the sense that even as an adult as you know you can learn new things maybe not as quickly by the way uh this is one of the things that surprised me so Barbara and I have you know looked at the people who you know really were benefited the most it turns out that the peak of the demographic is 25 to 35 Barbara Oakley Oakley yeah she's she's she's really The Mastermind she's a fabulous uh educator and and uh background in engineering but what's going on so it turns out we we aimed our uh uh our Muk at kids in high school and college because that's their business they go every day and they go into work and they have to learn right that's their business but in fact very very few uh of of the students are actually uh you know they weren't taking the C why should they they they spend all day in the class right why do they want to take another class so this is the your um the the learning to learn class learning how to learn okay so you did this with Barbara so we did this I did with Barbara and now 25 to 35 we have this huge Peak huge so what's going on here's what's going on it's very interesting so you're 25 youve gone to college half the People by the way who take the course went to college right so this it's not like you know filling in for college this is like topping it off but you're in a Workforce you have to learn new skill may maybe you have mortgage maybe you have children right you can't afford to to go go off and and and and take a course of in get another degree so you take a moo and you discover you know I'm not quite as agile as I used to be in terms of learning but it turns out with our course you can boost your learning and so that even though you're not as your your brain is isn't learning as quickly you can do it more efficiently this is amazing I I want to take this course um I will take this course what um what sort of time commitment is the course you already point out that it's zero cost which is amazing yeah yeah okay so uh it it's bite-sized videos lasting about 10 minutes each and there's about 50 or 60 over the course of one month and are you tested are you self test yeah there there are tests there are quizzes there are tests at the end and there are uh forums where you can go and talk to other students you have questions we have Tas know it's and anyone can do this anyone in the world in fact we have people in India Housewives who say thank you thank you thank you because I could have never learned about how to how to be a better learner and I wish I had known this when I was going to school why do more people not know about this learning to learn course although you as people know if I get really excited about it or about anything I'm I'm never going to shut up about it but I'm going to take the course first because I want to understand the gut you you'll enjoy it uh we we have like 98% approval which is phenomenal it's it's sticky lot is is it math vocabulary no math no vo it's not we're not teaching anything specific we're not te we're not trying to give you knowledge we're trying to tell you how to acquire knowledge and how to do that how to how to deal with exam anxiety for example or how to how to uh you know we all procrastinate right we we put things off well n no I'm kidding we all procrastinate how to avoid that we we we teach you how to avoid that fantastic okay I'm going to skip back a little bit now with the intention of of double clicking on this learning to learn thing you pointed out that in particular in California but elsewhere as well um there isn't as much procedural practice based learning anymore um I'm going to play devil's advocate here uh and I'm going to point out that this is not what I actually believe but you know when I was growing up you had to do your times tables and your Division and you know and then your fractions and your exponents and you know and you they build on one another um and then at some point you know you take courses where you might need it like a graphing calculator to some people they going be like what what is this but the point being that there were a number of things that you had to learn to implement functions and and you learn you learn by doing you learn by doing um likewise in in physics class we you know we were attaching things to Strings and for macr mechanics and and learning that stuff okay um and learning from the chalkboard uh lectures I can see the value of both certainly and you explained that the brain needs both to really understand knowledge and how to implement and back and forth but noways you know you'll hear the argument well why should somebody learn how to read a paper map unless it's the only thing available because you have Google Maps or if they want to do a calculation they just put it into the top bar function on the internet and boom out comes the answer so there is a world where certain skills are no longer required and one could argue that the brain space and activity and time and energy in particular could be devoted to learning new forms of knowledge that are going to be more practical in the school and Workforce going forward so how do we reconcile these things I mean I'm of the belief that the brain is doing math and you and I agree it's electrical signals and chemical signals and it's doing math and it's running algorithms I think you convinced us of that um certainly but how are we to discern what we need to learn versus what we don't need to learn in terms of building a brain that's capable of learning the maximum number of things or even enough things so that we can go into into this very uncertain future because as far as you know and I know there's no neither of us have a crystal ball so what is essential to learn and for those of us that didn't learn certain things in our formal education what should we learn how to learn well uh this is uh generational okay so Technologies provide us with tools you mentioned the calcul calcor right uh well a calculator didn't eliminate uh you know the education you need to get in math but it made certain things easier it SP it made it possible for you to do more things and more accurately however interestingly uh students in my class often uh come up with answers that are off by you know eight orders of magnitude then that if that's a huge amount right it's clear that they didn't key in the calculator properly but they didn't recognize that it was it was a very far it was completely way off the beam because they didn't have a good feeling for the numbers they don't have a good sense of you know exactly how big it should have been you know order of magnitude basic you know understanding so it's it's kind of a there there's a the benefit is that you can do things faster better but then you also lose some of your intuition if if you don't have the procedural system in place I'm thinking about a kid that wants to be a musician who uses AI to write a song about a bad breakup that then is kind of recovered when they find new Love and I'm guessing that you could do this today and get a pretty good song out of AI but would you call that kid a songwriter or a musician on the face of it yeah the AI is helping and then you'd say well that's not the same as sitting down with a guitar and trying out different chords and and feeling the intonation in their voice but I'm guessing that for people that were on the electric guitar they were criticizing people on the acoustic guitar you know so we have this generational thing where we look back and say that's not the real thing you need to get the so what what are the key fundamentals is really a critical question okay so I'm gonna come back to that because this is how the way you put it at the beginning had had to do with uh whether your how your brain is allocating resources Okay so when you're younger you can take in things your brain is more malleable for example uh how good are you on social media I well I do all my own Instagram and Twitter and those accounts have grown in proportion to the amount of time I've been doing it so yeah I would say pretty good I mean I'm I I'm not the biggest account on social media but for a science health account we we're doing okay um thanks to the audience well well well this speaks well for the fact that you've uh managed to uh break you know to go beyond the generation gap because I can type with my thumbs Terry okay there you go that's a manual skill that you learn new new uh new phenomenon in human evolution I I couldn't believe it I saw people doing that and now I can do it too but uh but the thing is that if you learn how to do that early in life you're much more uh good at it you you can you move your thumbs much more quickly also uh you can have many more you know tweets go and not what are they called now they're not called tweets on X I think they still call them tweets because you can't it's hard to verb the the the letter X Elon didn't think of that one I like X because it's cool it's kind of punk and it's got black black uh kind of format and it fits with kind of the the the the you know the engineer like black X you know and this kind of thing but yeah we'll still call them tweets well okay we'll call them tweets okay that's that's good but you know I I I walk across campus and I see everybody like half the people are are Tweeting or you know they're they're doing something with their cell phone they're I mean it's unbelievable you have beautiful sunsets at the Suk Institute we'll put a link to one of them I mean it is it is truly spectacular awe inspiring to see a sunset at the Sal Institute every day is different and everyone's on their phones these days sad and and you they're looking down at their phone and they walking along even people who are skateboarding unbelievable I mean you know it's amazing what the human being can do you know when they learn to get into something but what happens is younger generation picks up whatever technology it is and the brain gets really good at it and you Pi can pick it up later but you know not quite as agile not quite as uh maybe obsessive it fatigues me I will point this out that doing so doing anything on my phone feels fatiguing in a way that reading a A paperbook or even just writing on a laptop or a desktop computer is fundamentally different I can do that from many hours if I'm on social media for more than few minutes I can literally feel the energy draining out of my body interesting I would I could do um Sprints or deadlifts for hours and not feel the kind of fatigue that I feel from doing social media so you know this is fascinating I I like to know what's going on in your brain why why is it and and also I'd like to know from younger people whether they have the same I think not I think my guess is that they don't feel fatigued because they got into this early enough uh and this is actually uh a very very uh I I think that has a lot to do with the foundation you put into your brain in other words things that you that you get you learn when you're really young are foundational and they make things easier some things easier yeah I spent a lot of time in my room as a kid either playing with Legos or action figures or building fish tanks or reading about fish I would I tended to read about things and then do a lot of procedural based uh activities you know I read skateboard magazines and skateboard I I was never one to really just watch a sport and not play it so that you know bridging across these things so social media to me feels like an energy sync but of course I love the opportunity to be able to teach to people and learn from people at such scale but at an energetic level I I feel like I don't have a foundation for it it's like I'm trying to like like Jerry rig my cognition into doing something that it wasn't designed to do well there you go and it's because you don't have the Foundation you didn't do it when you were younger and now you have to sort of use the the cognitive powers to do a lot of what was being done now in a younger person procedurally I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar we should all know that proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function in fact even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance to a considerable degree it's also important that you're not just hydrated but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes in the right ratios drinking a packet of element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration and electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink a packet of element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes there are a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element I like the watermelon I like the raspberry I like the Citrus basically I like all of them if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman to claim an element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element spelled l m NT so it's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by Jude ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improv skin health and wound healing improvements in acne reduced pain and inflammation improved mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself now what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning they use specific wav Lance of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations personally I use the ju whole body panel about three to four times a week and I use the juv handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju

you something which is going to help all of your listeners my book uh chat GDP in the future of AI I went through and I looked at other people's experiences with chat GDP I just wanted to know what what people were thinking and what and I came across it was an article on I think it was the New York Times of a technical writer who decided she would spend one month using it to help her write things her articles and she said that when she started out you know at the end of the day she was drained completely drained and it was like you know working on a machine you know like a tractor or something you know he struggling struggling struggling to get it to work and then she started said well wait a second you you know what if I treat it like a human being what if I'm polite instead of you know being CT she said suddenly I started getting better Answers by by being polite and you know back and forth way with a human you know so saying could you please give me information about so and so please I'm really having trouble oh you know that answer you gave me was fabulous is exactly what I was looking for and you know now I need to to go on to the next part and help me with that too in other words the way you talk to a human right if an assistant that you or is it that she was talking to the AI to chat GPT it sounds like in this case in the way that her brain was familiar with asking questions to a human in other words can so is the AI learning her and therefore giving her the sorts of answers that are more fasile for her to to integrate with I I think it's both I the first of all the chat GDP is mirroring you're the way you treat it it will mirror that back you you treat it like a machine it will treat you like a machine okay because that's that's what it's good at but here's the surprise surprise is she said once I re once I started treating it like a human at the end of the day I wasn't fatigued anymore why well it turns out that all your life you inter you interact with humans in a certain way and your brain is wired to do that and it doesn't take any effort and so by treating the chat GDP as if it were a human you're taking advantage of all the brain circuits in your brain this is incredible and I'll tell you why because I think many people not just me but many people really enjoy social media um learn from it I mean yesterday I learned a few things that I thought were just fascinating about how we perceive our own um identity according to whether or not we're filtering it through the responses of others or whether or not we take a couple minutes and really just sit and think about how we actually feel about ourselves very interesting ideas about Locust of of self-perception and things like that I also looked at a really cool video of a baby raccoon popping bubbles while standing on its hind Limbs and that was really cool and social media could provide me both those things within the series of minutes and I was thinking to myself this is crazy right the raccoon is kind of trivial but it it delighted me and that's not trivial so but here's the question could it be that one of of the detrimental aspects of social media is that if we're complimenting one another or if we are giving hearts or we're giving thumbs Downs or we're in an argument with somebody or we're doing a clapback or they're clapping back on us as it or dunking as it's called on on X on um that it isn't necessarily the way that we learned to argue it's not necessarily the way that we learn to engage in healthy dispute and so as a consequence it feels like and this is my experience that certain online interactions feel really good and others feel like they kind of great on me like because there's almost like an action step that isn't allowed like you can't fully explain yourself or understand the other person right and I am somebody who you know believes in the in the power of real face-to-face dialogue or at least on the phone dialogue and I feel the same way about text messaging I hate text messaging when text messaging first came out I remember thinking I was not a kid that passed notes in class this feels like Ming notes in class in fact this whole text messaging thing is beneath me that's how I felt and over the years of course I became a text messager and it's very useful for certain things be there in five minutes running a few minutes late in my case that's a common one um but I think this notion of what GRS on us and as it relates to whether or not it matches our our childhood developed template of how our brain works is really key because it touches on something that I definitely want to talk about today that that I know you've worked on quite a bit which is this concept of energy what we're talking about here is energy not woo biology woo science Wellness energy we're talking about we only have a finite amount of energy and years ago the great Ben Baris sadly passed away our former colleague and uh my uh postto adviser came to me one day in the hallway and he stopped me and he said he called me Andy like you do and he said Andy how can we get so so a run down of energy as we get older why are we more why am I more tired today than I was 10 years ago I was like I don't know how are you sleeping he's like I'm sleeping fine Ben never slept much in the first place but he had a ton of energy and I thought to myself I don't know like what is this energy thing that we're talking about I want to make sure that we close the hatch on on this notion of a a template neural system that then you either find experiences invigorating or depleting I want I want to make sure we close the hatch on that but I want to make sure that we relate it at some point to this idea of of energy and why is it that with each passing year of our life we we seem to have less of it you know you asked these great questions and I wish that I had great answers well so far you so far you really do have great answers they're certainly novel to me in the sense that I've not heard answers of this sort um so there's a tremendous amount of learning for me today and I know for the audience so so but let's say you're somebody is 20 years old versus 50 years old versus what should they do I mean we need to integrate with the modern world world we also need to relate across Generations oh yeah no this is true this is people aren't retiring as much they're living longer birth rates are down but we have to get all get along as they say so you know it is interesting I think it's true that uh we all as we get older have have less of the you know the Vigor Vigor if I could use a somewhat different word from energy uh we'll come back to that um but I think there are some who manage to keep an active life here's something that again in in our moo we really emphasize could you explain a moo I think most people won't know what what a moo is just for their sake okay this is uh they've been around for about actually started at Stanford uh Andrew in uh and de nicer so they have a company called Cera and what what happens is that you get professors and in fact anybody who has knowledge or you know professional expertise to give lectures that are available to anybody in the world who have access to the internet and and uh you know it could there's like probably tens of thousands now any any specialty history uh Science music you know you name it there there's somebody who's done you know who's an expert on that wants to tell you because they're excited about what they're doing okay so so you know what what what we wanted to do was to help people with learning and so part of the problem is that it gets more difficult it takes more effort as as you get older it depletes your Vigor more if we're going to stay with this language of energy and vigor yeah yeah that's right so let's actually use the word energy as you know in the cell there is a physical power plant called the mitochondrian which is supplying us with uh ATP which is the coin of the realm for the cell to be able to operate all of its Machinery right so and so one of the things that happens when when you get older is that your mitochondrial run down you have fewer of them and they're less efficient they're they they that's right they're less efficient and and actually drugs can do that to you too it could they can they can harm mitochondria or recreational drugs no the drugs you take for illness I'm not sure about uh recreational drugs but uh I know I know it's a case that there are a lot of drugs that people take because they have to but uh but but the other thing and and this is something this that's the bad news here's the good news the good news is that you can replenish your energy by exercise that exercise is the best drug you could ever take it's the cheapest drug you could ever take that can help every organ in your body it it helps obviously your heart it helps your brain it it rejuvenates your brain it helps your immune system every single organ system in the body benefits from regular exercise I run on the beach every day at the Suk Institute I can I and I also at the it's on a Mesa 340 foot above the so I go down every day and then I I climb up the cliff yeah those steps down to Black's Beach are are they're good workout they are they are and so this is this is something has kept me active and it's and I I do hiking I went hiking in the Alps this in last fall so this is uh in September so this this is I think something that people really ought to realize is that you know it's like uh putting away you know reserves of energy for you know when you get older the more you put away the better off you are here's something else okay now this is jumping now to Alzheimer's so uh a study that was done in China many many years ago when I first came to U uh La Hoya San Diego um I heard this from the the it was the head of the Alzheimer's program he had done a study in China on onset and he he they they went and they had three populations they had PE peasants who had almost no education then they had another group that had high school education and then they were people who were you know Advanced education so it turns out that the onset of Alzheimer's was earlier for the people who had no education and it was the latest for the people who had the most education now this is interesting interesting isn't it because it's it's and presumably the genes aren't that different right I mean they're all Chinese so one possibility and and obviously we don't really know why but one possibility is that the more you exercise your brain with education the more Reserve you have later in life I I believe in the notion and I don't have a better word for it maybe you do or phrase for it is of kind of a cognitive um velocity you know I sometimes will play with this I'll I'll read slowly or I'll see where my default pace of reading is at a given time of day and then I'll intentionally try and read a little bit faster while also trying to retain the knowledge I'm reading right so I'm not just reading the words I'm I'm trying to absorb the information and you can feel the energetic demand of that and then and then I'll play with it I'll kind of back off a little bit and then I'll go forward and I try and find the sweet spot where I'm not reading at the pace that is reflexive but just a little bit quicker while also trying to retain the information and I learned this um when I had a lot of catching up to do at one phase of my educational career fortunately it was pretty early and I was able to catch up on most things you know occasionally things slip through and I have to go back and learn how to learn you know um and if I get anything wrong on the internet they sure as heck pointed out and then we go back and learn and guess what I never forget that because punish punishment social punishment is a great signal so thank you all um for uh keeping me uh learning but I picked that up from my experience of trying to get good at things like skateboarding or soccer when I was younger there's a certain um thing that happens when skateboarding that was my sport growing up where it's actually easier to learn something going faster you know most kids try and learn how to Olie and kickflip standing in the in the living room on the carpet that's the worst way to learn how to do it it's all easier going a bit faster than you're comfortable it's also the case that if you're not paying attention you can get hurt it's also the case that if you pay too much cognitive attention you can't perform the motor movements right so there's this sweet spot that eventually I was able to translate into an understanding of when I sit down to read a paper or a news article or even listen to a podcast there's a pace of the person's voice and then I'll adjust the the rate of the audio where I have to engage cognitively and I know I'm in a mode of retaining the information and learning whereas if I just go with my reflexive Pace it's rare that I'm in that perfect zone so I I point this out because perhaps it will be useful to people I don't know if it's incorporated into your learning how to learn course but I do think that there is something which I call kind of cognitive velocity which is ideal for learning versus kind of leisurely scrolling and this is why I think that social media is detrimental I think that we train our brain basically to be slow passive and multicontext cycling through and unless something is very high salience it kind of makes us kind of fat and lazy forgive the language but I'm going to be blunt here fat and lazy cognitively unless we make it a point to also engage learning right and my guess is it's tapping into this mitochondrial system uh very likely uh that's one part of it uh by the way uh you know the way that you've adjusted the speed is very interesting because it turns out that uh stress you know everybody thinks oh stress is bad but no it turns out stress that is Trent you know that is only for a limited amount of time that you control is good for you it's good for your brain it's good for your body I run intervals on the beach just the way that you do cognitive intervals when you're reading in other words I run I run like hell for about 10 seconds and then I you know I I go to a jog and I run like hell for another 10 seconds and it's pushing your body into into that extra gear that helps the muscles the muscles need to know that this is what they've got to put out and that's where you gain uh uh you know muscle mass not not from just doing the same running pace every day well your intellectual and physical Vigor is undeniable um I've known you a long time you've always had a slight forward Center of mass in your uh intellect and even the speed at which you walk Terry D I say okay you're for a Californian you're a quick Walker okay yeah so uh that's a compliment by the way um East Coasters know what I'm talking about and Californians would be like you know um why not slow down the reason to not slow down too much for too long is that these mitochondrial systems the energy of the brain and body as you point out are very linked and I do think that below a certain threshold it makes it very hard to come back just like below a certain threshold is hard to exercise um without getting depleted or even injured that we need to maintain this so perhaps now would be a good time to close the hatch on this issue of um how to teach young people everyone should take this learning tolearn course as a free resource amazing um as it relates to AI do you think that young people and older people now I'm 49 so put myself in the older bracket should be learning how to use AI they are already learning how to use Ai and uh again it's just like uh at new technology comes along who picks it up first it's the younger people and it's it's astonishing uh you know they they're using it a lot more than I am you know I use it uh almost every day but uh I know a lot of students who basically and by the way it's a it's like any other Tool It's A Tool uh that you you need how to know how to use it where do you suggest people start so um I have started using Claude AI okay this was um suggested to me by somebody expert in AI as an alternative to chat GPT I don't have anything against chat GPT but I'll tell you I really like the um aesthetic of Claude AI it's a bit of a softer beige aesthetic it feels kind of apple like I like the Apple brand and it gives me answers maybe it's the font maybe it's the feel maybe this goes back the example use earlier where I like Claude Ai and I'm a big fan of it and they don't pay me to say this I have never met them I have no relationship to them except that it gives me answers in a bullet pointed format that feels very aesthetically easy to transfer that information into my brain or onto a page right so I like Claud AI you use chat GPT how should people start to explore AI um for sake of getting smarter learning knowledge just for the sake of knowledge having fun with it what's the best way to do that well I think exactly what you did which is of there's there's now dozens and dozens of different uh chat Bots out there and different people will uh feel comfortable with one or the other chat GDP is the first so that's why it's kind of taken over a lot of the uh cognitive space right it's it's become like Kleenex right that that word that was why I Ed it as the first word in my new book because it's iconic but uh but but some of them um I have to say that for example there are some that are really much better at math than others uh there such as Google's Gemini recently did some fine tuning with uh what's called uh you know chain of of reasoning other words when you reason you go through a sequence of steps and when you solve a math problem you go through a sequence of par of steps of doing you know fitting first finding out what missing and then adding that and it went from 20% correct to 80 right on on those problems and as people hear that they probably think well that means 20% wrong still but could you imagine any human or panel of humans behind a wall where if you asked it a question and then another question and another question that it would give you back better than 80% accurate information in a matter of seconds so I think we we are uh uh being uh perhaps a little bit uh unfair to compare these large language models to the best humans rather than the average human right as you said most people couldn't pass the LSAT the law test to get into law school or MCAT the test to get into medical school and chat GPT has is there a world now where we take the existing AI llms these computers basically that can learn like a collection of human brains and send that somehow into the future right give them an imagined future okay could we give them outcome a and outcome B and let them forage into future states that we are not yet able to get to and then harness that knowledge and explore the two different outcome comes I think that's perhaps the the better question in some sense um because we can't travel back in time but we can perhaps travel into the future with AI if you provide it different scenarios and you say unlike a panel of people panel of experts medical experts or um space Travel Experts or um sea Travel Experts you can't say hey you know what don't sleep tonight um you're just going to work for the next 48 hours in fact you're going to work for the next 3 weeks or three months um and you know what you're not going to do anything else you're not going to pay attention to your health you're not going to do anything else but you can take a large language model and you can say just forage for knowledge under the following different scenarios and then have that Fleet of large language models come back and give us the information like I don't know tomorrow okay so I've lived through this myself back in the 19 1980s I was just starting my career and I was one of the Pioneers in developing learning algorithms for neural network models Jeff Hinton and I collaborated together on something called the B Machine and he actually won a no prize for this Rec just this year yeah one of my best friends uh you know brilliant and and he he well deserved it for not just the Boler machine but all the work he's done since then on um machine learning and then uh back propagation and so forth but um back then we Jeff and I had this view of the future AI was dominated by symbol processing rules logic right writing computer programs for every problem you need a different computer program and it was very uh you know human resource intensive to write programs so that it was very very uh slow-going and they never actually got there they never wrote a program for vision for example even though the computer vision computer Community really worked hard for a long time but you know we had this view of the future we had this view that uh the the Nature has solved these problems and is existence proof that you can solve the vision problem look every animal can see even insects right come on uh well figure out let's figure out how they did it maybe we can help by following up uh when on nature we can actually again going back to algorithms I was telling you and so in the case of the brain what makes it different from a digital computer digital computers basically can run any program but a fly brain for example only runs the program that it's a special purpose Hardware allows it to run not much neuroplasticity there's enough there just enough you habituation and so forth uh so that you can survive and this is survive 24 hours I'm not trying to be disparaging to the fly biologist but when I think of neuroplasticity I think of the Magnificent neuroplasticity of the human brain to customize to a world of experience I agree you know when I think about a fly I think about a really cool set of neural circuits that um that work really well to avoid getting swatted to eating and to reproducing and not a whole lot else they don't really build technology they might have interesting relationships but who knows who cares it just sort of like it's not that it doesn't matter it's just a question of the lack of plasticity makes them kind of a meh species okay I can see I've pressed your button here no no no no I love fly biology they taught us about algorithms for direction selectivity in the visual system no no I I love the drop biology I just think that the lack of neuroplasticity reveals a certain um like key limitation and that the reason we're the curators of the earth is because we have so much plasticity of course of course uh but you have to take you know one step at a time nature first has to be able to create creatures that can survive and then you know their brain get bigger as they uh environment gets more complex and you know here we are but uh but the the the the the key is that it turns out that certain algorithms in the fly brain are present in our brain like conditioning classical conditioning you can classical condition of fly in terms of you know training it to to uh when you give it a reward it will produce the same action right this is like conditioned behavior and that algorithm that I told you about that is in your value function right temporal difference learning that algorithm is in the fly brain it's in your brain so we we can learn about learn from many species I was just having a little fun poking at the fly biologist I actually think dropa has done a great deal as has honeybee biology uh for instance if you if you give caffeine to uh uh bees on particular flowers they'll actually um try and pollinate those flowers more because they actually like the feeling of of being caffein there's a bad pun about a buzz here but I'm not going to make that pun cuz everyone's done it before um right no I I I fully absorb and agree with the the value of studying simpler organisms to find the algorithms right that's where we are right now uh but uh now to go just go into the future now I'm telling the story about what where we were we were predicting the future we were saying this is an alternative traditional uh AI we were not taken seriously everybody was experts said no no WR programs right programs they were getting all the resources the grants the jobs and we were just like the little furry mammals under the feet of the these dinosaurs right in retrospect I love the analogy but but here but the dinosaurs died off this is this is but the point I'm making is that it's possible for our brain to make these extrapolations into the future why not AI versions of brains why not I I I think it's your idea is a great one yeah I I mean the reason I'm excited about Ai and increasingly so across the course of this conversation is because there are very few opportunities to forage information at such large scale and around the circadian clock I mean if there's one thing that we are truly a slave to as humans is the Circadian biology right you got to sleep sooner or later and even if you don't your cognition really waxes and wains across the Circadian cycle and if you don't you're going to die early we know this computers can work work work uh sure you got to power them there's the cool thing there are a bunch of things related to that but that's that's tractable so computers can work work work and the idea that they can provide a portal into the future and that they can just bring it back so we can take a look see I'm not saying we have to implement their their advice but to be able to send a panel of diverse computationally diverse experientially diverse AI experts into the future and bring us back a panel of potential routes to take to me is so exciting um maybe a good example would be um like treatments for schizophrenia this is an area that I I want to make certain that we talk about you know I grew up learning as a neuroscience student that schizophrenia was somehow A A disruption of the dopamine system because if you give neuroleptic drugs that block dopamine receptors that you get some improvement in the in the motor symptoms some of the hallucinations Etc you now also have people who say no that's not really the basis of schizophrenia I love your thoughts and you have incredible work from people like Chris Palmer at Harvard and we even have a department at Stanford now uh focusing we even have people at Stanford now focusing on what Chris really founded as a field which is metabolic Psychiatry the idea that who could imagine I'm being sarcastic here what you eat impacts your mitochondria how you exercise impacts your mitochondria mitochondria impacts brain function and what and behold metabolic health of the brain and body impacts schizophrenia symptoms and he's looked at ways that people can use ketogenic diet maybe not to cure but to treat and in some cases maybe even cure schizophrenia so here we are at this place where we still don't have a quote unquote cure for schizophrenia but you could send llms into the future and start to forage the most likely all of the data in those fields I could do that in an hour plus it come up with a bunch of hypothesized different um positive and negative result clinical trials that don't even exist yet 10,000 subjects in Scandinavia who you know go on ketogenic diet who have a certain level of um uh susceptibility of schizophrenia based on what we know from twin studies things that never ever ever would be possible to do in an afternoon maybe even in a year there's isn't funding there isn't and boom get the answers back and let them present us those answers and then you say well it's it's artificial but so are human brains coming up with these experiments so to me I'm starting to realize that it's not that we have to implement everything that AI tells us or offers us it just sure as hell gives us a great window into what might be happening or is likely to happen specifically for schizophrenia I'm pretty sure that if we had these large language models 20 years ago we would have known back then that ketamine would have been a really good drug to try to help these people tell us about the relationship between ketamine and schizophrenia okay um because I think a lot of people and maybe you could Define schizophrenia even though most people think about people hearing voices and psychosis like there's there's a bit more to it um that maybe we just you know con bring out so uh one of the things now that we know see the problem is that if you look at the endpoint that doesn't tell you what started the problem it started during early in development you know schizophrenia is something that uh is appears when you know late adolescence early adulthood but it actually is already a problem uh genetic problem from Theo so what is the concordance in identical twins meaning if you have one identical twin if you have if you have identical twins in the womb right and one is destined to be full-blown schizophrenic what's the probability the other so here's here's here's the experiment okay this is very very been replicated many many times in mice I should say oh no actually it it okay let me start with a human Okay so ketamine is was for a long time and it still is a party drug Special K I've never taken it but this is what I hear of anesthetic but I'll tell you what happens because I've I've talked to these you know people who have done this you take ketamine sub anesthetic by the way it's an anesthetic it's given to Children uh it's a pretty good anesthetic and it's also used veterinary medicine but in any case you give it you give it to um you take you know young adults here's what they experience they experience out of- body experience you know they they they have this wonderful feeling of energy and they're very you know it's a it's a high but it's a very unusual high now you know if if if they just go and have one experience but if they have two like they they party two days in a row a lot of them come into the imersion emergency room and here's what the what the symptoms are full-blown psychosis full-blown we're talking about you know indistinguishable from a schizophrenic break so auditory hallucination yeah auditory hallucinations you know paranoia very very Advanced you know you'd say that my God this this person here is is really is gone you know in in has become a schizophrenic and this is really uh like I say the symptoms are the same however if you isolate them for a couple days they'll come back right so so it means that schizophrenia can induce I me sorry ketamine can induce a form of schizophrenia psychosis temporarily not permanently fortunately okay so what does it attack okay and there's another literature on this it turns out that it binds to a a form of receptor a glutamate receptor called nmda receptors which are very important by way for learning a memory but we know the Target and we also know what the uh the acute outcome is that it it reduces the strength of the inhibitory circuit the the interneurons that use inhibitory transmitters get the the the enzyme that creates the inhibitory transmitter is downregulated and what does that do it means that there's more excitation and what does that mean when there's more excitation it means that there's more activity in the cortex and there's actually much more Vigor and and you you you you start becoming crazy right if it's too much activity so this is interesting so this is this is telling us I think that we should be thinking about uh and now there's a whole field now in Psychiatry that has to do with uh you know the glutamate hypothesis for the the the the first uh where where the actual um imbalance first occurs it's an imbalance between the exciting inhibitory systems that are in the cortex are keep you in balance and nmda and methylaspartate receptors are glutamate receptors one one class that's one class that's right okay so now here is hypothesis for why ketamine might be good for depression people are taking it now who are depressed right so here you have a drug that causes overe excitation and here you have a person who's undere excited depression is associated with lower excitatory activity in some parts of the cortex well if you titrate it you can come back into balance right so you what you do is you fight depression with schizophrenia a touch of schizophrenia now you you know you have to keep giving I think once every three weeks they have to have a you know a new dose of ketamine but it's helped an enormous number of people with very very very severe you know clinical depression so so as we learn more about the mechanisms underlying some of these disorders the better we are going to be at extrapolating and and coming up with some solutions at least to prevent it from getting worse by the way I'm pretty sure that the large language models could have figured this out you know long ago so in an attempt to understand how we might be able to leverage these large language models now how would we have used these large language models long ago let's say you had 2024 AI technology in 19 let's have fun here um 1998 the year that I started graduate school right at that time it was like the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was in every textbook there was a little bit about glutamate perhaps but you know um it was all about dopamine so how would the large language models have discovered this ketamine was known as a drug ketamine by the way is very similar to PCP F cycline which also binds the nmda receptor um so how would which is also a part of drug which is also yeah not one I recommend nor ketamine uh frankly I I don't recommend any recreational drugs but I'm not a recreational drug guy but um what would those large language models do if they so you got 2024 technology placed into 1998 they're foraging for existing knowledge but then are they able to make predictions like hey this stuff is going to turn out to be wrong or hey this stuff okay okay you know you know this is all very very speculative uh and really uh we can begin actually to see this happening now uh so I have a colleague at the Suk Institute Rusty Gage very distinguished neuroscientist and he was he was one of the he he discovered that there are new neurons being born in the hippocampus right which is something in adults which is something that in a textbook says that doesn't happen right so that was around 1998 did right that's right and I actually have a paper with him where we tested ltp longterm potentiation of for actually the effects of exercise on neurogenesis exercise increases neurogenesis it it increases the the the the the cells that it increases neurogenesis and also this the the cells that are act are become part of the circuit more cells become integrated and this is true in humans as well right yeah we and there was some cancer drug that was given that you know that they showed that it was uh there new cells that were able that they were able to later in postmortem to actually see that they were born in the adult okay so here we are okay in 1998 and the question is uh can you C can you jump can you jump into the Future Okay so Rusty we were at you know had to happen to talk about this issue about you know he's using these large language models now for his research I said oh wow how do you use it and he said we Ed it as an idea pump what do you mean idea pump well we you know we give it all of the experiments that we've done and uh and we have it you know the the literature its access to the literature and so forth and we ask it for ideas for new experiments oh I love it I love it I was on a plane where I sat next to a guy that worked at works at Google and he he's one of the um main people there in terms of voice to to text um and text to voice uh software and he showed me something I'll provide a link to it because it's another one of these open resource things um and I'm not super techy I'm not like the I don't get an F in technology don't get an A+ I'm kind of in the middle so I think I'm pretty representative of the average listener for this podcast presumably what you show me is that you can take um you open up this website and you can take PDFs or you can take um URLs so websites uh website addresses and you just place them in the margin you literally just drag and drop them there and then you can ask questions and the AI will generate answers that are based on the content of whatever you put into this margin those PDFs those websites and the cool thing is it references them so you know which one which article it came from right and and then you can start asking it more sophisticated questions like in the two examples of um the effects of a drug one being very strong and one being very weak which of these papers do you think is more rigorous based on you know subject number but also kind of the strength of the findings you know pretty vague thing strength of findings is pretty vague right anyone that argues those are weak findings those aren't enough subjects well we know a hell of a lot about human memory from one patient hm so strength of findings when people is a subjective thing right you really have to be an expert in a field to understand strength of findings and even then and what's amazing is it starts giving back answers like well if you're concerned about number of subjects this paper but that's a pretty obvious one which one had more subjects but it can start critiquing the statistics that they used in these papers in very sophisticated ways and explain back to you why certain papers may not be interesting and others are more interesting and it starts to wait the evidence oh my God and then you say well with that weighted evidence can you hypothesize what would happen if and so I've done a little bit of this where it starts trying to predict the future based on you know 10 papers that you gave it five minutes ago amazing I don't think any uh Professor could do that except in their very specific area of interest and if they were already familiar with the papers and it would take them many hours if not days to read all those papers in detail and they they might not actually come up with the same answers right right yeah so so this is so actually this is something that uh is happening in Medicine by the way uh for doctors who are using AI as an assistant this is this is really interesting so so uh and this is Dermatology was a paper in nature uh you know skin lesions there's several 2,000 skin lesions some of them are are you know cancerous and others are benign and so in any case they they tested the expert doctors and then they tested an AI and they were both doing about you know 90% right however if you let the doctor use the AI it boosts the doctor to 98% 98% ACC yes and what's going on there it's very interesting so it turns out that although they got the same 90% they had different expertise that the uh AI had access to more data and so it could look at the lesions that were rare that the doctor may never have seen okay but the doctor has more in-depth knowledge of the most common ones that he's seen over and over again and those the subtleties and so forth but so putting them together it makes so much sense that they're going to improve if they work together and I think that now what you're saying is that using AI as a tool for Discovery uh it with you know the expert who's interpreting and and and looking at the arguments the statistical arguments and also uh looking at the paper maybe in a new way maybe that's a future of science maybe that's what's going to happen everybody everybody's worried about oh AI is going to replace us it's going to be much better than we are everything and and humans are obsolete nothing can be further from the case our strengths and weaknesses are different and we by working together it's going to strengthen it's uh you know both you know what we do and what AI does uh and it's it's it's going to be partnership it's not going to be adversarial it's going to be a partnership would you say that's the case for things like understanding or discovering um treatments for neurologic illness um for um avoiding you know large scale catastrophes like can it predict um macro movements uh let me give an example um here in Los Angeles uh there's occasionally an accident on the freeway um you have a lot of cameras over freeways nowadays um you have cameras and cars you can imagine all of the data being sent in in real time and you could probably um predict accidents pretty easily I mean these are just moving objects right at a specific rate who's driving haphazardly but you could also potentially um signal takeover of the brakes or the steering wheel of a car and prevent accidents I mean certain cars already do that but could you essentially eliminate well let's do something even more important let's eliminate traffic I don't know if you can do that but um because that's a funel problem but um could you could you predict um physical events in the world into the Future Okay this has already been done not for traffic but for hurricanes so you you know as you know the weather is extremely difficult to predict and except here in California where it's always going to be sunny but now uh what they've done is uh to feed a lot of previous uh data from previous hurricanes and also uh simulations of hurricanes you can simulate them in a in a supercomputer it takes days and weeks so it's not very useful for actually accurately predicting where it's going to hit Florida but what they did was after training up the AI on all of this data it was able to predict with much better accuracy exactly where in Florida is going to make a landfall and it it does that in on your lab laptop in 10 minutes incredible so I something just clicked for me and it's probably obvious to you and to most people but I I think this is true I think what I'm about to say is true at the beginning of our conversation we were talking about the acquisition of knowledge versus the implementation of knowledge just learning facts versus learning how to implement those facts in the form of physical action or cognitive action right math problem is cognitive action physical action okay AI can do both knowledge acquisition it can learn facts long lists of facts and combinations of facts but presumably it can also run a lot of problem sets and solve a lot of problem sets I don't think except with some crude still to me examples of Robotics that it's very good at action yet but it will probably get there at some point robots are getting better but they're not they're not doing what we're doing yet but it seems to me that as long as they can acquire knowledge and then solve different problem sets different iterations of combinations of knowledge that basically they are in a position to take any data about prior events or current events and make pretty darn good predictions about the future and run those back to us quickly enough and to themselves quickly enough that they could play out the different iterations and so I'm thinking you know one of the problems that seems to have really vexed neuroscientists and the field of medicine and the general public has been like the increase in the um at least diagnosis of autism I've heard so many different hypotheses over the years I think we're still pretty much in the fog on this one um could could AI start to come up with um new and and um potential Solutions and and treatments if they're necessary but maybe get to the heart of this this problem it might and it it depends on the data you have it depends on the complexity of the disease um but it will happen in other words uh we will use those tools at the best we can because obviously this if if you can make any progress at all and and jump into the future wow that would save lives that would help so many people out there I I I really think the promise here is so great that even though there are flaws and there are regulatory problems we just we really really have to really push and and we have to do that in a way that is um going to help people uh you know in terms of U making their jobs better and and uh helping them uh solve problems that otherwise they would have had difficulty with and so forth and it's beginning to happen but you know it's uh these are early days so we're at a stage right now with I that is similar to what happened after the first flight of the W Brothers you know in other words it's that significant the the the the achievement that the right brothers made was to get off the ground 10 feet and to power forward with a human being 100 feet right that was it that was the first flight and it took an enormous amount of improvements the the most difficult thing that had to be solved was control how do you control it how do you make it go in the direction you want it to go uh and shades of what's Happening Now in AI is that you know we are off the ground we we're not going very far yet but who knows where it will take us into the future let's talk about Parkinson's disease a depletion of dopamine neurons that leads to difficulty in smooth movement Generation Um and also some cognitive and mood-based um dysfunction um tell us about your work on Parkinson's and and what what did you learn so uh as as you point out Parkinson's is uh first a degenerative disease it's it's very interesting because the DOP mean cells are a particular part of the brain the brain stem and and they are the ones that are responsible for procedural learning I told you before about temporal difference it's DOP mean cells and uh it's a very powerful way for the it's a Global signals called a neurom modulator because it modulates all the other signals taking place you know throughout the cortex and also it's uh very important for uh learning uh uh sequences of actions uh you know that produce um survival for survival and um but the the problem is that uh with certain uh environmental insults you know of especially you know uh toxins like pesticides uh those neurons are very vulnerable and when they die you get all of the symptoms that you just described that the the the people who have lost those cells uh actually before the treatment you know elopa which is a DOP mean precursor they actually were um became Kos right they didn't move they were still alive but just didn't move at all you know they they tragic yes locked in it's called yeah it's tragic tragic so when the when the first uh Trials of of of elopa were were given to them it was magical because suddenly they started talking again so I mean this is amazing amazing I'm curious when they started talking again did they report that their brain State during the locked in Phase yes was slow velocity like was it sort of like a dream like state or they felt like they were in a nap or were they in there like screaming to get out because their physical velocity obviously was Zero um they're locked in after all and I've long wondered when coming back from a run or from waking up from a great night's sleep when I shift into my you know waking State whether or not physical velocity and cognitive velocity are linked okay that's a wonderful observation or question you know I bet you know the answer okay here's here's something that is really uh amazing it's it was uh discovered interestingly when you know they they tend to move slowly as you said but to them cognitively they they think they're moving fast now it's not because they can't move fast because you can say well can you move faster sure and they move normal right but to them they think they're moving at you know super velocity so so it's a set point issue so it's a set point issue yes it's all about set points that's what what's really going on and and and the set point gets further and further down you know that now now they they without moving at all they think they're moving right I mean this is what's going on by the way you can ask them you know what was it like you know we were talking to you and you didn't respond oh I didn't feel like it the brain confabulates an answer they have well they they they that they confabulated it because they didn't have enough energy or they couldn't initiate they couldn't initiate actions that that's one of the things that they have trouble with it with uh movements you know starting a movement yeah as you can tell I'm I'm fascinated by this notion of cognitive velocity and again there may be a better or more accurate or official uh um language for for it but I feel like it it encompasses so much of what we try to do when we learn and the fact that during sleep you have these very um vivid dreams during rapid I've move and sleep so cognitive velocity is very fast time perception is different than in SL slow wave sleep dreams um I really think there's something to it as a as a um at least one metric that relates to brain State yes I've long thought that we know so much more about brain States during sleep than we do about wakeful brain States like we talk about Focus motivated flow I mean the these are not scientific terms I'm not I'm not being disparaging of them they're pretty much all we've got um until we come up with something better but like we're biologists and neuroscientists and computational neuroscientists in your case and and we're like trying to figure out like like what brain state are we in right now our cognitive velocity is is a you know a certain value but I think the more that people think about this um you know I'll venture to say that the more that they think a little bit about their cognitive velocity at different times of day I start to notice that there's a tends to be a few times of day for me it tends to be early to late midm morning um and then again in the evening after a little bit of trough and energy that boy that hour and a half each like that's the time to get real work done I can I can mentally Sprint far at those times right but there are other times of day when I don't care how much caffeine I drink I don't care unless it's a stressful event that I need to meet the demands of that stress you I just can't I can't get to that faster Pace while I'm also engaging you can read faster you can listen but you're not using the information you're not storing the information right what time a day for you are are no I I I get most done in the morning and then you're right later uh after uh uh dinner uh is is also different though I think in the morning uh I'm I'm better at creative stuff and then I think that in the evening I'm better at actually just cranking it out you know interesting um given the relationship between uh body temperature and circadian rhythm I would like to run experiment that um relates uh core body temperature to cognitive velocity you know I've actually noticed this is something that is just purely subjective but the temperature of the Sal inside the building is kept 75 it's like you know rock solid but in the afternoon I feel a little chilly it's probably my you know internal sure you know body temperature body temperature yeah is probably going down and that may correspond to the loss of energy you know the amount of the ability for the brain and everything else by the way you know this is Q10 this is a jargon every single enzyme in in your every cell can go at different rates depending on the temperature right and so yeah so if the body temperature is doing this and all the cells are doing this too right so this is uh it's an explanation I'm not sure if it's the right one but yeah uh Craig heler my colleague at Stanford in the biology department has beautifully described how the enzymatic uh control over pyruvate I believe it is controls um muscular failure that local muscular failure you know when people are like trying to move some resistance has everything to do with the temperature the local temperature wow that shuts down certain enzymatic processes that don't allow the muscles to contract the same way you know he knows the details and he covered them on this podcast I'm forgetting the details you start to go wow like these enzymes are so beautifully controlled by temperature and of course his laboratory is focused on ways to bypass those temperature um or to change temperature locally in order to bypass those limitations and and have shown them again and again it's it's just incredible yeah I don't I here we're speculating about what it would mean for cognitive velocity but I think um it's such a different world to think about the underlying biology as opposed to just thinking about like a drug you know you increase dopamine in norepinephrine and and epinephrine the so-called catacol means and you're going to increase energy focus and alertness but you're going to pay the price you're going to have a trough in energy focus and alertness that's proportional to how much greater it was when you took the drug boy amphetamines are a good example Boy you know you you're going a mile a minute when you're taking the drug of course you know you it's it's it's i f understand that that's your impression and the reality is you don't actually accomplish that much more have any llms so been used to um answer this really pressing question of what is going to be the consequence on cognition for these young brains that have been weaned um while taking riddlin adderal viance and other stimulants because we have a we have you know millions of of kids that have been raised experiment on our our you know whole Cadre a whole generation and you know I I really would like to know the answer you you're I I wonder if anybody studying that that's really a great question because we we gave them speed effectively you know the drug that causes uh the brain to be activated but uh but by the way but but you know the the you know there's the consequence is that you know when it wears off you have no energy right right you you're just completely spent yeah that's it that's the pit that's the pit and so and but that's why you take more of it you see that's the problem is it's it's a spiral um I love how today you're making it so very clear how computation how math and computers and AI now are really shaping the way that we think about these biological problems which are also psychological problems which are also Daily challenges I also love that we touched on mitochondria and how to replenish mitochondria I want to make sure that we talk about a couple of things that I know are in the back of people's minds no pun intended here um which are Consciousness and Free Will normally I don't like to talk about these things not because they're sensitive but because I find the discussions around them typically to be more philosophical than neurobiological and they tend to be pretty circular and so you get people like Kevin Mitchell um who is a real I think he has a book about free will he believes in Free Will um you've got people like Robert spolski wrote the book determined he doesn't believe in Free Will how do you feel about Free Will and is it even a discussion that we should be having well if you go back 500 years you know the Middle Ages the the the concept didn't exist or at least not in the way we use it because everybody it was it was the the way that we that humans felt about the you know the world and how it worked and and and it's its impact on them was that it's all fate they had this concept of Fate which is that there's nothing you can you can do that that something is is going to happen to you because of the what's going on in the the gods up above or whatever it is right you get you attribute it to the to the physical forces around you that caused it not not to your own free will not to something that you did that caused you to this to happen to you right so so I think that these words that by the way that we use Free Will Consciousness intelligence understanding their weasel words because you can't pin down there is no definition of Consciousness that everybody agrees on and it's it's tough to solve a problem scientific problem if you don't have a definition that you can agree on and uh and you know there's this big controversy about whether these large language models understand language or not right the way we do and uh and and what what it really is revealing is we don't understand what understanding is we literally we don't have a really good argument or measure you know that you could measure someone's understanding and then apply it to chat GDP and see whether it's the same it it probably isn't exactly the same but maybe there's some Continuum here we're talking about right um you know the way I look at it uh you know it's as if an alien suddenly landed on Earth and started talking to us in English right and the only thing we could be sure of was that it's not human I met some people that I wondered about their uh terrestrial Origins okay okay well okay now there's a big diversity amongst humans too you're right about that yeah yeah certain colleagues of ours at UCSD years ago uh one in particular in the physics department who I absolutely adore as a human being um just had such an unusual pattern of speech of behavior totally appropriate behavior but just unusual in the middle of a faculty meeting we just kind of turn to me and start talking while the other person was presenting and I was like maybe not now and they'd go and he would say oh okay but in any other domain you'd say he was very socially Adept and so you know that there's certain people that just kind of discard with convention and you kind of Wonder like is he an alien it's kind of cool in a in a cool way like you know he's one of my again a friend and somebody it's true it's true you know no no every not everybody uh has adopted the same social conventions uh you know it could be a touch of autism I mean yeah that's a problem that I mean in other words there are very high functioning autistic people out there well he's brilliant this and often they are you know it's U they're high people who are brilliant that with autism uh but but you know could you build an llm that was more um uh on one end of the spectrum versus the other to see what kind of information they for paper I reviewed a paper seem would be a a a really important thing to do it's been done okay there was a paper that I reviewed where they they they took the LM they fine-tuned it with different data from people with different disorders you know the autism and so forth um and um sociopaths you know that's scary but you want to know the answer no and and they got they got these llms to behave just like those people who have these disorders you can get them to behave that way yes could you do um political leaning in values I haven't seen that but uh it's pretty clear that to me at least that that if if you can do sociopathy you can probably do any political belief you know but you could also view all this as um you could take benevolent tracks you could also say um hyper creative uh um sensitive to um uh uh emotional tone of voices and find out what kind of information that person bring uh excuse me that llm okay brings back versus somebody who is very oriented towards just the content of people's words as opposed to what what you know because among people you find this you know if you've ever left a party with a significant other and sometimes someone will say I've had this experience with like did you see that interaction between so and so I'm like know what are you talking about like did you hear that I'm like no not at all I didn't hear I heard the words but I did not pick up on what you were picking up on right and it was clear that there's two very different experiences of the same content based purely on a on a difference in interpretation of the tonality okay there's a lot of information that you as you point out which has to do with uh the tone the uh in spatial Expressions uh you know there's a tremendous amount of information that is is pass not just with words but with all the other parts the visual input and so forth and some people are good at picking that up and others are not there's a tremendous variability between individuals and you know that's that's biology is all about diversity and it's all about you know needing gene pool that's very diverse so that you can evolve and and uh uh survive catastrophic changes that uh occur in a climate for example but uh wouldn't it be wonderful if we could create an llm that could understand what the those differences are now just think about it right like a truly diverse llm that integrated all those differences but here's how what you'd have to do what you'd have to do is to train it up on data from a bunch of individuals human individuals now one of the things about these llms is that they don't have a single Persona they can adopt any Persona you have to tell it what what you're expecting from or ask it in a way that works for you and you'll get back a certain Persona if you if you if I once gave it an abstract from a paper very technical computational paper and I said you are a neuroscientist I want you to explain this abstract to a 10-year-old it it did it in in a way that I could never have done it it really simplified it it some of the subtleties were not in it but it explained you know what plasticity it was and explained what a synapse is and you know it it did that it's almost like a qualifying exam for a graduate student I saw something today on X formerly known as Twitter that blew my mind that I wanted your thoughts on that is very appropriate to what you're saying right now which is someone was asking questions of an llm on chat G PT or maybe one of these other anthropic or Claude or something like that u i probably misuse those names one of the the the AI um uh online sites and somewhere in the middle of its answers the llm decide to just take a break and start looking at pictures of landscapes in yede like the llm was was doing what a what a what a maybe cognitive cognitively fatigued person or what any kind of online person person online would do which was to like take a break and look at a couple pictures of something they you know maybe they're thinking about going camping there or something and then get back to whatever task we hear about hallucinations in AI that some that it can imagine things that aren't there just like a human brain but um that blew my mind I haven't encountered that but you know isn't it fascinating uh you know that that's a sign of of a real generative internal model uh if if it's see here's the thing that U real the thing that most distinguishes I think in llm from a human is that you know if if you if if if you go into a room quiet room and just sit there without any sensory stimulation your brain keeps thinking right in other words you you think about what you want to do you know planning ahead or something that happened to you during the day right your brain is always generating internally you know after talking to you one of these large language models just goes blank there is no self uh continuous self-generated thoughts and yet we know self-generated thought and in particular brain activity during sleep as you Illustrated earlier with the example of sleep spindles and rapid eye movement sleep are absolutely critical for um shaping the knowledge that we were experience during the day so yes so these llms are not quite where we are at yet I mean they they can um outperform Us in certain things like go um but how soon will we have llms ai that is with um self-generated internal activity we're we're getting closer um and and so this is something I'm working on myself actually uh trying to understand how that's done in our own brain brains was generating continual uh brain activity that leads to you know planning and things that we don't know what the answer to that is yet in Neuroscience it it it and by the way you go to a lecture and you you hear the words one after the next over an hour and you see the slides one after the next at the end you ask a question right just let's think about what you just did somehow you're able to integrate all that information over the hour and and then use your long-term memory then to come up with some insight or some issue that you want that how did your brain remember all that information working memory traditional working memory that neuroscientist study is only for a few seconds like or maybe a telephone number or something but we're talking about long-term working memory we don't understand how that is done and llms actually large language models can do something it's called in context learning and and it's a really it was a great surprise because there is no plasticity the thing learns at the beginning you train it up on data and then all it does after that is to inference you know fast loop of Activity one word after the next right that that's what happens with no learning no learning but it's been noticed that as you continue your dialogue it seems to get better at things how could that be how could it be in context learning even though there's no plasticity that's a mystery we don't know the answer to that question yet but we also don't know what the answer it is what what the answer is for humans either right could I ask you a few questions about you and as it relates to science and your trajectory um building off of what you were just saying do you have a practice of meditation or um eyes closed sensory input reduced or shut down um to drive your thinking in a particular way or are you you know at your computer talking to your students in postto and sprinting on the beach you know it's no it's funny you mention that because I get my best ideas uh not sprinting on the beach but you know just uh either walking or jogging uh and it's it's wonderful I don't know I think you know serotonin goes up it's it's another neurom modulator I think that that stimulates ideas and thoughts and so inevitably I come back to the my office and I can't remember any of those great ideas what do you do about that well now I take notes okay voice memos yeah uhhuh and uh and some of them are pan out you know there's no doubt about it that you're put into a situation uh it is a form of meditation you know if you're running uh in a steady Pace nothing distracting about you know the beach or do you listen to music or podcasts or no I I never listen to anything except except my my own thoughts so there's a a former guest on this podcast um who she happens to be triped degreed from Harvard but she's more in the um kind of like personal coach space but very very high level and impressive mind impressive human all around and she has this um concept of wordlessness that um can be used to accomplish a number of different things but this idea that allowing oneself or or creating conditions for oneself to enter States throughout the day or maybe once a day of very minimal sensory input no lecture no podcast no book no music nothing and allowing the brain to just kind of um idle and go a little bit uh nonlinear if you will right where we're not constructing thoughts or paying attention to anyone else's thoughts through those media venues um in any kind of structured way as a source of great ideas and creativity it's been studied psychologists call it mind wandering mind wandering yeah it it's it is a significant literature and it it's uh often when you have an aha moment when you know your mind it's wandering and it's it's thinking nonlinearly uh in the sense of not following a sequence that is logical you know hopping from things the thing often that's when you get a a great idea uh with just letting your mind wander yeah and that happens to me I I wonder whether social media and just texting in phones in general have eliminated a lot of the you know walks to the car after work where one would normally not be on a call or in communication with anyone or anything I used to do experiments where I was you know like P petting and running imun you know imunohistochemistry and it was very relaxing and I could think while I was wow I'm and relaxing and thinking of things and then I I would listen to music sometimes okay so we have a whole session uh you know a clip in learning how to learn about exactly this phenomenon here's here's what we tell our students right is that you know if you're having trouble with some concept or you know you don't understand something you're beating your head against the wall don't ju stop stop just go off and do something go off and and clean the dishes go off and you know walk around the block and inevitably what happens is when you come back your your mind is clear and you figure out what to do and and that's one of the best pieces of advice that anybody could get because you know we don't nobody has told us how the brain works right we we we we some people are really good at intuiting uh because they've experienced you maybe um and and and and but everybody I okay the other thing is everybody I know who's really uh made important contributions and I'll bet you're one of them uh you know you're struggling with some problem at night and you go to bed and you wake up in the morning Ah that's the solution that's what I should do right first thing in the morning when I wake up is when I I'm almost bombarded with um I wouldn't say insight and not always meaningful Insight but certainly what was unclear becomes immediately clear onw that's the thing that is so amazing about sleep and and and and you can see people who know this can can count on it in other words the key is to think about it before you go to sleep right your brain works on it during the sleep period right and so you know don't watch TV because then who knows what your brain's going to work on you know use you know use the time before you fall asleep to think about something that is bothering you or maybe something that you know you're trying to understand maybe uh you know a paper that you you read the paper and say oh you know I'm I'm tired I'm going to go to sleep you wake up in the morning say oh I know what's going on in that paper yeah I mean that's what happens you can use you know once you know something about how the brain works you can take advantage of that do you pay attention to your dreams do you record them no no okay so here's the problem dreams seem so uh iconic and and a lot of people you know somehow attribute things to them but it it there's has never been any good theory or any good understanding first of all why we dream we still it's still not completely clear I mean there are some ideas but or uh what Tri why this particular dream is this this does that have some significance for you and the only thing that I know uh that might explain a little bit is that uh you know the dreams are often very visual uh you know rapid eye movement sleep so that there's something happening that that actually it's interesting all the neuromodulators are downregulated during sleep and then during G sleep the cocoline comes up right so that's a very powerful neuromodulator it's important for attention for example but it doesn't come up in the prefrontal cortex which means that the circuits in the prefrontal cortex that are interpreting what the sensory input coming in uh are not turned on so any of these whatever happens in your visual cortex is not being monitored anymore so you get bizarre things you know that you start floating and you know things happen to you and you know it's it's not anchored anymore and so but that does still doesn't explain why right why you have that period it's important because if you block it and there are some sleeping pills that do block it you know it really does cause problems with uh you know normal cognitive function cannabis as well people who um come off cannabis um experience a tremendous REM rebound and lots of dreaming uh in the T you know the days and weeks and months after um cannabis um wow with I don't want to call it withdrawal cuz that is different meaning no no it's it's it's a it's a imbalance that was caused of you know because the the brain adjusted to the you know the endocannabinoid levels and now uh it it's got to go back and it takes time but it's interesting isn't interesting it affects dreams I I think that may be a clue maybe very very common uh phenomenon um I'm told I'm not a cannabis user but uh no judgment there I just am not um it's actually a uh a book I read years ago when I was in college so lot long time ago um by Alan Hobson who was out at Harvard oh yeah I know him who um oh cool so I never met him um but he had this interesting idea that dreams in particular rapid eye movement dreams were so very similar to the experience that one has on certain psychedelics LSD lysergic acid dimide or psilocybin and that perhaps dreams are revealing the unconscious mind you know and not saying this any psychological terms you know that you know when we're asleep our conscious mind can't control thought and action in the same way obviously and kind of a it's sort of a recession of the water line you know so we're getting more of the the uh unconscious processing revealed you know that's an interesting hypothesis how would you test it uh probably have to put someone in a scanner have them go to sleep put them in the scanner on a um psilocybin Journey this kind of thing um you know that it's tough I mean any of these observational studies of course we both know are deficient in the sense that what you'd really like to do is control the neural activity that's right you'd like to get in there and tickle the neurons over here and see how the brain changes and you'd love to get real- time subjective report this is the problem with sleep and dreaming is people you can wake people up and ask them what they were just dreaming about but you can't really know what they're dreaming about in real time it's true yeah it's true by the way you know there are two kinds of dreams h very interesting uh so if you wake someone up during R sleep you you get very Vivid uh changing dreams are always they're always different and changing but if you wake someone up during slow wave sleep you often get a dream report but it's kind of dream that keeps repeating over and over again every night and it's a very heavy emotional content interesting that's in in slow wave sleep yeah because I've had a few dreams over and over and over throughout my life so this would be in slow wave sleep yeah probably slow W sleep yeah fascinating um as a neuroscientist who's computationally oriented but really you incorporate the biology so well into your work so that's one of the reasons you're you you're this luminary of your field and who's also now really excited about AI what are you most excited about now like if you had and you know of course this isn't the case but if you had like 24 more months to just pour yourself into something and then you had to hand the keys to your lab over to someone else what would you go all in on well so the NIH has something called the Pioneer award and what they're looking for are big ideas that could have a huge impact right so I put one in recently and and and here's the the the the title is um a temporal context in brains and Transformers and in brains and transforms Transformers formers AI right the the the key to uh chat GTP is the fact there this new architecture it's a deep learning architecture feedforward network but it's called a Transformer and it has certain parts in it that are are unique there one called self attention and and and it's it's it's a way of doing what is called temporal context uh what it does is it connects words that are far apart you give it a sequence of words and it can tell you the association like if I you use the word this and then you have to figure out in the last sentence what it did refer to well there's three or four nouns it could have referred to but from Context you can figure out which one it does and you can learn that Association could um could I just play with another example to make sure I understand this correctly um I've seen these word bubble charts like if we were to say piano you'd say keys you'd say music you'd say seat you and then you know it kind of builds out a word cloud of Association and then over here we'd say um I don't know I'm thinking about the Salin say Sunset Stonehenge anyone that looks up there's this phenomena Sal henge then you start building out a word cloud over there these are disperate things except I've been to a classical music concert at the Suk Institute Symphony OFA twice so they're not completely non-overlapping and so you start getting associations at a distance and eventually they Bridge together is this what you're referring to yes I think that that's uh an example but uh it turns out that every word is ambiguous it has like three four meanings and so you have to figure that out from Context and and there so in other words there there are words that live together and and uh that come up often and you can learn that from just by you know predicting the next word in a sentence that's how a Transformer is get trained you give it a bunch of words and it keeps predicting the next word in the sentence like in my email now it tries to mostly right part of the time okay well that's because it's a very primitive version of this algorithm what happen is if you treat if you train it up on enough it not not only can It answer the next word it it it build internally builds up a semantic representation in the same way you describe the words that are related to each other having uh you know associations uh it can figure that out and it has representations inside this very large network with trillions of parameters unbelievable how big they gotten uh and the uh th those those associations now form an internal model of the meaning of the sentence literally it it it it it it's been this is something that now we've probed these Transformers and so we we pretty much are are pretty confident and that means that it's forming an internal model of the outside world in this case a bunch of words and that's how it's able to actually respond to you in a way that is sensible that makes sense and actually is interesting and so forth uh and it's all the self- attention I'm talking about so any case my Pioneer proposal is to figure out how does the brain do self-attention right it it's got to do it somehow and I'll give you a little hint basil ganglia it's in the basil ganglia that's my hypothesis well we'll see I mean you know I've I'll be working with experimental people uh I've worked with John Reynolds for example who studies uh primate visual cortex and we've looked at traveling ways there and and there are other people that have looked at U in primates and the you know and so now these traveling waves I think are also a part of the of the the you know the puzzle pieces of the puzzle that are going to give us a much better view of how the the cortex is organized and how it interacts with the basil ganglia I've already we've already been there but we're we we still you know neuroscientists have studied each one of these parts of the brain independently and now we have to start thinking about putting the pieces of the puzzle together right trying to get all the things that we know about these areas and see how they work together in a computational way and that's really where I want to go I love it and I do hope they decide to fund your Pioneer award I do too yeah and should they make the bad decision not to you know maybe we will'll figure out another way to get it get the work done certainly you will um Terry I I want to thank you um first of all for coming here today taking time out of your busy cognitive and running and teaching and research schedule to share your know with us and also for the incredible work that you're doing on public education and teaching the public I should say giving the public resources to learn how to learn better at zero cost so we will certainly provide links to learning how to learn and your book and to these other incredible resources that you've shared and you've also given us a ton of practical tools today related to exercise mitochondria and some of the things that you do which of course are just your versions of what you do but that c certainly certainly are going to be of value to people including me in our cognitive and physical Pursuits and frankly just longevity I mean this this is uh not lost on me and those listening that uh your Vigor is as I mentioned earlier undeniable and it's been such a pleasure over the years to just see the amount of focus and energy and enthusiasm that you bring to your work and to observe that it not only hasn't slowed but you're picking up velocity so thank you so much for for educating us today I I know I speak on behalf of myself and many many people listening and watching this is a real gift uh a real incredible experience to learn from you so thank you so much well thank you and I have to say that I've been blessed over the years with wonderful students and wonderful colleagues and I count you among them who really I've learned a lot from thank you but you know we're we're you know science is a social ity and and we learn from each other and we all make mistakes uh but we learn from our mistakes and that's the

the knowledge that you are uh uh broadcasting through your interviews but also you know just in terms of your interests uh really I'm I'm really impressed with what you've done and and I want you to keep you know at it because uh we need people like you um we need uh we need U scientists who can actually Express and reach the public if we if we don't do that everything we do is behind closed doors right nothing gets out and and so you're you're one of the the best of of the breed in terms of being able to uh explain things in a clear way that gets through to more people than anybody else

Title: Is It Safe to Microwave Plastic Containers?
Published: 2024-11-15 20:56:58 UTC
Description:
Dr. Shanna Swan discusses the potential hazards of using plastic containers in microwaves, emphasizing that even microwave-safe plastics can leach harmful chemicals like BPA and phthalates into food when heated.

Transcript Language: English
Is it true that microwave safe means, it just means that the plastic won't melt in the microwave, but it's... Never, never put plastic in a microwave. So here's the story. The BPA, phthalates, plasticizers are added to the plastic, but they're not chemically bound to it, okay? So if you put anything in a container that has these chemicals in it, they will, and then put it in a hot environment, they will come out of the plastic and go into the food. So if you, in a microwave, or you put your bottle in the car and the sun comes in and it warms up the bottle, and then the stuff goes into your water. You don't want to mix these chemicals and your food, but if you do, the worst thing is to do it in a heated environment.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. For today's podcast, we're going to talk about the parts list of the nervous system. Now, that might sound boring, but these are the bits and pieces that together make up everything about your experience of life. From what you think about to what you feel, what you imagine, and what you accomplish from the day you're born until the day you die. By the end of this podcast, I promise you're going to understand a lot more about how you work and how to apply that knowledge. So let's talk about the nervous system. The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain is because your brain is actually just one piece of this larger, more important thing, frankly, that we call the nervous system. The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord, but also all the connections between your brain and your spinal cord and the organs of your body. It also includes, very importantly, all the connections between your organs back to your spinal cord and brain. So the way to think about how you function at every level, from the moment you're born until the day you die, everything you think, and remember, and feel, and imagine is that your nervous system is this continuous loop of communication between the brain, spinal cord, and body, and body, spinal cord, and brain. In fact, we really can't even separate them. It's one continuous loop. The way to think about how the nervous system works is that our experiences, our memories, everything is sort of like the keys on a piano being played in a particular order. If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order and with a particular intensity, that's a given song. We could make that analogous to a given experience. Our brain is really a map of our experience. We come into the world, and our brain has a kind of bias towards learning particular kinds of things. It's ready to receive information and learn that information, but the brain is really a map of experience. So let's talk about what experience really is. What does it mean for your brain to work? Well, I think it's fair to say that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six. The first one is sensation. Sensation is a non-negotiable element of your nervous system. You have neurons in your eye that perceive certain colors of light and certain directions of movement. You have neurons in your skin that perceive particular kinds of touch, like light touch, or firm touch, or painful touch. You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds. Your entire experience of life is sort of filtered by these, what we call, sensory receptors, if you want to know what the name is. Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing and focus on it and make sense of it, to explore it, to remember it. So really, perceptions are just whichever sensations we happen to be paying attention to at any moment. Perception is under the control of your attention. And the way to think about attention is it's like a spotlight. Except it's not one spotlight, you actually have two attentional spotlights. Anyone that tells you you can't multitask, tell them they're wrong, and if they disagree with you, tell them to contact me. Because in old world primates, of which humans are, we are able to do what's called covert attention. We can place a spotlight of attention on something, for instance, something we're reading or looking at, or someone that we're listening to, and we can place a second spotlight of attention on something we're eating and how it tastes, or our child running around in the room, or my dog. You can split your attention into two locations, but of course, you can also bring your attention, that is your perception, to one particular location. You can dilate your attention, kind of making a spotlight more diffuse, or you can make it more concentrated. This is very important to understand if you're going to think about tools to improve your nervous system. Attention is something that is absolutely under your control. The nervous system can be reflexive in its action or it can be deliberate. Deliberate thoughts are top-down. They require some effort and some focus, but that's the point. You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want, but it will always feel like it requires some effort and some strain. Whereas when you're in reflexive mode, just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing, it's going to feel very easy. And that's because your nervous system basically wired up to be able to do most things easily without much metabolic demand, without consuming much energy. But the moment you try and do something very specific, you're going to feel a sort of mental friction. It's going to be challenging. So we've got sensations, perceptions, and then we've got things that we call feelings/emotions. And these get a little complicated because almost all of us, I would hope all of us, are familiar with things like happiness and sadness, or boredom or frustration. Certainly emotions and feelings are the product of the nervous system. They involve the activity of neurons. But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active, but they also release chemicals. And there's a certain category of chemicals that has a very profound influence on our emotional states. They're called neuromodulators. And those neuromodulators have names that probably you've heard of before, things like dopamine, and serotonin, and acetylcholine, epinephrine. Neuromodulators are really interesting because they bias which neurons are likely to be active and which ones are likely to be inactive. A simple way to think about neuromodulators is they are sort of like playlists that you would have on any kind of device, where you're going to play particular categories of music. So, for instance, dopamine, which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy, is involved in reward and it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood when released in appropriate amounts in the brain. But the reason it does that is because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits, as we call them, more active and others less active. OK, so, serotonin, for instance, is a molecule that when released tends to make us feel really good with what we have, our sort of internal landscape and the resources that we have. Whereas dopamine, more than being a molecule of reward, is really more a molecule of motivation toward things that are outside us and that we want to pursue. And we can look at healthy conditions or situations, like being in pursuit of a goal where every time we accomplish something en route to that goal, a little bit of dopamine is released and we feel more motivation, that happens. We can also look at the extreme example of something like mania, where somebody is so relentlessly in pursuit of external things, like money and relationships, that they're sort of in this delusional state of thinking that they have the resources that they need in order to pursue all these things, when in fact they don't. I want to emphasize also that emotions are something that we generally feel are not under our control. We feel like they kind of geyser up within us and they just kind of happen to us. And that's because they are somewhat reflexive. We don't really set out with a deliberate thought to be happy or a deliberate thought to be sad. We tend to experience them in a passive, reflexive way. And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts. Thoughts are really interesting because in many ways they're like perceptions, except that they draw on not just what's happening in the present, but also things we remember from the past and things that we anticipate about the future. The other thing about thoughts that's really interesting is that thoughts can be both reflexive, they can just be occurring all the time, sort of like pop-up windows on a poorly filtered web browser, or they can be deliberate. We can decide to have a thought. And a lot of people don't understand, or at least appreciate, that the thought patterns and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts can actually be controlled in this deliberate way. And then finally, there are actions. Actions, or behaviors, are perhaps the most important aspect to our nervous system because first of all, our behaviors are actually the only thing that are going to create any fossil record of our existence. After we die, the nervous system deteriorates, our skeleton will remain. But it's in the moment of experiencing something very joyful or something very sad, it can feel so all encompassing that we actually think that it has some meaning beyond that moment. But actually for humans, and I think for all species, the sensations, the perceptions, and the thoughts and the feelings that we have in our lifespan, none of that is actually carried forward except the ones that we take and we convert into actions, such as writing, actions, such as words, actions, such as engineering new things. And so the fossil record of our species and of each one of us is really through action. And that, in part, is why so much of our nervous system is devoted to converting sensation, perception, feelings, and thoughts into actions. The other way to think about it is that one of the reasons that our central nervous system, our brain and spinal cord, include this stuff in our skull, but also connects so heavily to the body is because most everything that we experience, including our thoughts and feelings, was really designed to either impact our behavior or not. And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past and anticipate the future, and not just experience what's happening in the moment, gave rise to an incredible capacity for us to engage in behaviors that are not just for the moment. They're based on things that we know from the past and that we would like to see in the future. And this aspect of our nervous system of creating movement occurs through some very simple pathways. The reflexive pathway basically includes areas of the brainstem we call central pattern generators. When you walk, provided you already know how to walk, you are basically walking because you have these central pattern generators, groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot kind of movement. However, when you decide to move in a particular deliberate way that requires a little more attention, you start to engage areas of your brain for top-down processing, where your forebrain works from the top down to control those central pattern generators so that maybe it's right foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, right foot, left foot, if maybe you're hiking along some rocks or something and you have to engage in that kind of movement. So movement is just thoughts, can be either reflexive or deliberate. And when we talk about deliberate, I want to be very specific about how your brain works in a deliberate way, because it gives rise to a very important feature of the nervous system that we're going to talk about next, which is your ability to change your nervous system. And what I'd like to center on for a second is this notion of what does it mean for the nervous system to do something deliberately? Well, when you do something deliberately, you pay attention, you are bringing your perception to an analysis of three things. Duration, how long something is going to take or should be done. Path, what you should be doing. And outcome, if you do something for a given length of time, what's going to happen. Now, when you're walking down the street, or you're eating, or you're just talking reflexively, you're not doing this, what I call, DPO, duration, path, outcome, type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system. Let's give an example where perhaps somebody says something that's triggering to you, you don't like it, and you know you shouldn't respond. You feel like, "oh, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond." You are actively suppressing your behavior through top-down processing. Your forebrain is actually preventing you from saying the thing that you know you shouldn't say, or that maybe you should wait to say, or say in a different form. This feels like agitation and stress because you're actually suppressing a circuit. We actually can see examples of what happens when you're not doing this well. Some of the examples come from children. If you look at young children, they don't have the forebrain circuitry to engage in this top-down processing until they reach age 22 or even 25. But in young children, you see this in a really robust way. A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants and will just reach out and grab it, whereas an adult probably would ask if they could have a piece or wait until they were offered a piece, in most cases. People that have damage to the certain areas of the frontal lobes don't have this kind of restriction. They'll just blurt things out. They'll just say things. Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control, a lack of top-down processing. So a lot of the motor system is designed to just work in a reflexive way. And then when we decide we want to learn something, or do something, or not do something, we have to engage in this top-down restriction, and it feels like agitation because it's accompanied by the release of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine, which in the body we call adrenaline, and it actually makes us feel agitated. So for those of you that are trying to learn something new, or to learn to suppress your responses, or be more deliberate and careful in your responses, that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason. It's going to feel challenging because the chemicals in your body that are released in association with that effort are designed to make you feel kind of agitated. And so this is really important to understand, because if you want to understand neuroplasticity, you want to understand how to shape your behavior, how to shape your thinking, how to change how you're able to perform in any context, the most important thing to understand is that it requires top-down processing. It requires this feeling of agitation. In fact, I would say that agitation and strain is the entry point to neuroplasticity. So let's take a look at what neuroplasticity is. Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections in the brain and body to change in response to experience. And what's so incredible about the human nervous system in particular is that we can direct our own neural changes. We can decide that we want to change our brain. In other words, our brain can change itself and our nervous system can change itself. For a long time, it was thought that neuroplasticity was the unique gift of young animals and humans, that it could only occur when we're young. And in fact, the young brain is incredibly plastic. Children can learn three languages without an accent reflexively, whereas adults, it's very challenging. It takes a lot more effort and strain, a lot more of that duration, path, outcome kind of thinking in order to achieve those plastic changes. We now know, however, that the adult brain can change in response to experience. In order to understand that process, we really have to understand something that might at first seem totally divorced from neuroplasticity, but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity. And for any of you that are interested in changing your nervous system so that something that you want can go from being very hard, or seem almost impossible and out of reach, to being very reflexive, this is especially important to pay attention to. Plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gated, meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators. These things that we talked about earlier, dopamine and serotonin, and one in particular called acetylcholine, are what open up plasticity. They literally unveil plasticity and allow brief periods of time in which whatever information, whatever thing we're sensing, or perceiving, or thinking, or whatever emotions we feel, can literally be mapped in the brain such that later it will become much easier for us to experience and feel that thing. Now this has a dark side and a positive side. The dark side is it's actually very easy to get neuroplasticity as an adult through traumatic, or terrible, or challenging experiences. But the important question is to say why is that? And the reason that's the case is because when something very bad happens, there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators in the brain. Epinephrine, which tends to make us feel alert and agitated, which is associated with most bad circumstances, and acetylcholine, which tends to create a even more intense and focused perceptual spotlight. Remember earlier we were talking about perception and how it's kind of like a spotlight. Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright and particularly restricted to one region of our experience. And it does that by making certain neurons in our brain and body active much more than all the rest. So acetylcholine is sort of like a highlighter or marker upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later and says, wait, which neurons were active in this particularly alerting phase of whatever, day or night, whenever this thing happened to happen. So the way it works is this. You can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention compared to what you were experiencing before. And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule that highlights whatever it happens during that period of heightened alertness. So just to be clear, it's epinephrine creates the alertness that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brainstem, if you're interested, and acetylcholine coming from an area of the forebrain is tagging or marking the neurons that are particularly active during this heightened level of alertness. Now, that marks the cells, the neurons, and the synapses for strengthening, for becoming more likely to be active in the future, even without us thinking about it. OK? So, in bad circumstances, this all happens without us having to do much. When we want something to happen, however, we want to learn a new language, we want to learn a new skill, we want to become more motivated, what do we know for certain? We know that process of getting neuroplasticity so that we have more focus, more motivation, absolutely requires the release of epinephrine. We have to have alertness in order to have focus, and we have to have focus in order to direct those plastic changes to particular parts of our nervous system. Now, this has immense implications in thinking about the various tools, whether or not those are chemical tools, or machine tools, or just self-induced regimens of how long or how intensely you're going to focus in order to get neuroplasticity. But there's another side to it. The dirty secret of neuroplasticity is that no neuroplasticity occurs during the thing you're trying to learn, during the terrible event, during the great event, during the thing that you're really trying to shape and learn, nothing is actually changing between the neurons that is going to last. All the neuroplasticity, the strengthening of the synapses, the addition in some cases of new nerve cells, or at least connections between nerve cells, all of that occurs at a very different phase of life, which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest. And so neuroplasticity, which is the kind of Holy Grail of human experience, of this is the new year and everyone's thinking New Year's resolutions. And right now, perhaps everything's organized and people are highly motivated. But what happens in March, or April, or May? Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus one can continually bring to whatever it is they're trying to learn, so much so that agitation and a feeling of strain are actually required for this process of neuroplasticity to get triggered. But the actual rewiring occurs during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest. There's a study published last year that's particularly relevant here that I want to share. It was not done by my laboratory. That showed that 20 minutes of deep rest, this is not deep sleep, but essentially doing something very hard and very intense and then taking 20 minutes afterward, immediately afterwards, to deliberately turn off the deliberate, focused thinking and engagement actually accelerated neuroplasticity. There's another study that's just incredible, and we're going to go into this in a future episode of the podcast not too long from now, that showed that if people are learning a particular skill, it could be a language skill or a motor skill, and they hear a tone just playing in the background, the tone is playing periodically in the background, like just a bell. In deep sleep, if that bell is played, learning is much faster for the thing that they were learning while they were awake. It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep, doesn't even have to be in dreaming, that something that happened in the waking phase was especially important. So much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue, it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain, oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning at that particular time of day. And the learning rates and the rates of retention, meaning how much people can remember from the thing they learned, are significantly higher under those conditions. So I'm going to talk about how to apply all this knowledge in a little bit more in this podcast episode, but also in future episodes. But it really speaks to the really key importance of sleep and focus, these two opposite ends of our attentional state. When we're in sleep, these DPOs, duration, path, and outcome analysis, are impossible. We just can't do that. We are only in relation to what's happening inside of us. So sleep is key. Also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest where we're turning off our analysis of duration, path, and outcome, in particular, for the thing that we were just trying to learn, and we're in this kind of liminal state where our attention is kind of drifting all over. It turns out that's very important for the consolidation, for the changes between the nerve cells, that will allow what we were trying to learn to go from being deliberate, and hard, and stressful, and a strain to easy and reflexive. This also points to how different people, including many modern clinicians, are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances, traumas, from routing their way into our nervous system permanently. It says that you might want to interfere with certain aspects of brain states that are away from the bad thing that happened, the brain states that happened the next day, or the next month, or the next year. And also, I want you to be aware. I want to make sure that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you, you're thinking about neuroplasticity, not just in changing your nervous system to add something new, but to also get rid of things that you don't like, that you want to forget bad experiences, or at least remove the emotional contingency of a bad relationship, or a bad relationship to some thing, or some person, or some event. Learning to fear certain things less, to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma. The memories themselves don't get erased. I'm sorry to say that the memories don't themselves get erased, but the emotional load of memories can be reduced. And there are a number of different ways that that can happen. But they all require this thing that we're calling neuroplasticity. We're going to have a large number of discussions about neuroplasticity in depth. But the most important thing to understand is that it is indeed a two phase process. What governs the transition between alert and focused, and these deep rest and deep sleep states is a system in our brain and body, a certain aspect of the nervous system, called the autonomic nervous system. And it is immensely important to understand how this autonomic nervous system works. It has names like the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, which frankly, are complicated names because they're a little bit misleading. Sympathetic is the one that's associated with more alertness. Parasympathetic is the one that's associated with more calmness. And it gets really misleading because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy, and then people think it's related to calm. I'm going to call it the alertness system and the calmness system because even though sympathetic and parasympathetics are sometimes used, people really get confused. So, the way to think about the autonomic nervous system and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life, but in particular for neuroplasticity and engaging in these focused states and then these defocused states, is that it works sort of like a seesaw. Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact that when we wake up in the morning, we might be a little bit groggy, but then generally we're more alert. And then as evening comes around, we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy, and eventually at some point at night, we go to sleep. So we go from alert to deeply calm. And as we do that, we go from an ability to engage in these very focused duration, path, outcome types of analyzes to states in sleep that are completely divorced from duration, path, and outcome in which everything is completely random and untethered in terms of our sensations, perceptions, and feelings, and so forth. So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day that is optimal for thinking, and focusing, and learning, and neuroplasticity, and doing all sorts of things. We have energy as well. And at another phase of our day, we're tired and we have no ability to focus. We have no ability to engage in duration, path, outcome types of analyzes. And it's interesting that both phases are important for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want. So if we want to engage neuroplasticity and we want to get the most out of our nervous system, we each have to master both the transition between wakefulness and sleep and the transition between sleep and wakefulness. Now, so much has been made of the importance of sleep, and it is critically important for wound healing, for learning, as I just mentioned, for consolidating learning, for all aspects of our immune system. It is the one period of time in which we're not doing these duration, path, and outcome types of analyzes. And it is critically important to all aspects of our health, including our longevity. Much less has been made, however, of how to get better at sleeping, how to get better at the process that involves falling asleep, staying asleep, and accessing these states of mind and body that involve total paralysis. Most people don't know this, but you're actually paralyzed during much of your sleep so that you can't act out your dreams, presumably, but also where your brain is in a total idle state where it's not controlling anything, it's just left to free run. And there are certain things that we can all do in order to master that transition, in order to get better at sleeping. And it involves much more than just how much we sleep. We're all being told, of course, that we need to sleep more, but there's also the issue of sleep quality, accessing those deep states of non-DPO thinking. Accessing the right timing of sleep. Not a lot has been discussed publicly as far as I'm aware of when to time your sleep. I think we all can appreciate that sleeping for half an hour throughout the day, so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep every 24-hour cycle is probably very different and not optimal compared to a solid block of eight hours of sleep. Although there are people that have tried this. I think it's been written about in various books. Not many people can stick to that schedule. Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman schedule. Not to be confused with the Huberman schedule, because first of all, my schedule doesn't look anything like that. And second of all, I would never attempt such a sleeping regime. The other thing that is really important to understand is that we have not explored as a culture, the rhythms that occur in our waking states. So much has been focused on the value of sleep and the importance of sleep, which is great, but I don't think that most people are paying attention to what's happening in their waking states and when their brain is optimized for focus, when their brain is optimized for these DPOs, this duration, path, outcome types of engagements for learning and for changing, and when their brain is probably better suited for more reflexive thinking and behaviors. And it turns out that there is a vast amount of scientific data, which points to the existence of what are called ultradian rhythms. You may have heard of circadian rhythms. Circadian means circa, about a day. So it's 24-hour rhythms because the Earth spins once every 24 hours. Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day and they require less time. They're shorter. The most important ultradian rhythm for sake of this discussion is the 90-minute rhythm that we're going through all the time in our ability to attend and focus. And in sleep, our sleep is broken up into 90-minute segments. Early in the night, we have more phase 1 and phase 2 lighter sleep. And then we go into our deeper phase 3 and phase 4 sleep. And then we return to phase 1, 2, 3, 4. So all night, you're going through these ultradian rhythms of stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. It's repeating. Most people perhaps know that. Maybe they don't. But when you wake up in the morning, these ultradian rhythms continue, and it turns out that we are optimized for focus and attention within these 90-minute cycles, so that at the beginning of one of these 90-minute cycles, maybe you sit down to learn something new or to engage in some new challenging behavior, for the first 5 or 10 minutes of one of those cycles, it's well known that the brain, and the neural circuits, and the neuromodulators are not going to be optimally tuned to whatever it is you're trying to do. But as you drop deeper into that 90-minute cycle, your ability to focus, and to engage in this DPO process, and to direct neuroplasticity, and to learn is actually much greater. And then you eventually pop out of that at the end of the 90-minute cycle. So these cycles are occurring in sleep and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness. And all of those are governed by this seesaw of alertness to calmness that we call the autonomic nervous system. So if you want to master and control your nervous system, regardless of what tool you reach to, whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool, or whether or not it's a behavioral tool, or whether or not it's a brain machine interface tool, it's vitally important to understand that your entire existence is occurring in these 90-minute cycles, whether or not you're asleep or awake. And so you really need to learn how to wedge into those 90-minute cycles. And for instance, it would be completely crazy and counterproductive to try and just learn information while in deep sleep by listening to that information because you're not able to access it. It would be perfectly good, however, to engage in a focused bout of learning each day. And now we know how long that focused bout of learning should be. It should be at least one 90-minute cycle, and the expectation should be that the early phase of that cycle is going to be challenging. It's going to hurt. It's not going to feel natural. It's not going to feel like flow, but that you can learn and the circuits of your brain that are involved in focus and motivation can learn to drop in to a mode of more focus, get more neuroplasticity, in other words, by engaging these ultradian cycles at the appropriate times of day. For instance, some people are very good learners early in the day and not so good in the afternoon. So you can start to explore this process, even without any information about the underlying neurochemicals, by simply paying attention, not just to when you go to sleep and when you wake up each morning, how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively, but also throughout the day, when your brain tends to be most anxious because it turns out that has a correlate related to perception that we will talk about. You can ask yourself, when are you most focused? When are you least anxious? When do you feel most motivated? When do you feel most least motivated? By understanding how the different aspects of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought, and actions tend to want to be engaged or not want to be engaged, you develop a very good window into what's going to be required to shift your ability to focus or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking at different times of day, should you choose. And so that's where we're heading going forward. It all starts with mastering this seesaw that is the autonomic nervous system, that at a coarse level is a transition between wakefulness and sleep. But at a finer level, and just as important, are the various cycles, these ultradian 90-minute cycles that govern our life all the time, 24/7 hours a day, every day of our life. And so we're going to talk about how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system so that you can better access neuroplasticity, better access sleep, even take advantage of the phase that is the transition between sleep and waking to access things like creativity and so forth, all based on studies that have been published over the last 100 years, mainly within the last 10 years, and some that are very, very new, and that point to the use of specific tools that will allow you to get the most out of your nervous system. So today we covered a lot of information. It was sort of a whirlwind tour of everything from neurons and synapses to neuroplasticity and the autonomic nervous system. We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward. So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass, please don't worry. We will come back to these themes over and over again. I wanted to equip you with a language that we're all developing a kind of common base set of information going forward. And I hope the information is valuable to you and you're thinking about what is working well for you, and what's working less well, and what's been exceedingly challenging and what's been easy for you in terms of your pursuit of particular behaviors or emotional states, where your challenges or the challenges of people that you know might reside. So thank you so much for your time and attention. And above all, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]
