Title: Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2023-02-01 13:00:27 UTC
Description:
This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode is the third in the sixth episode series on fitness exercise and performance today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss that is the specific protocols required to achieve the four different kinds of endurance and how to maximize fat loss Dr Andy Galpin great to be back today we're going to talk about endurance and I'm very interested in this conversation because I like many other people strive to get a certain amount of cardiovascular work in each week maybe a longish jog maybe a swim ride the bike Etc but when I think about the word endurance the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly but I have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation so I'm excited to learn about that I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance and other modes of repeated activity so in order to kick things off I'd love for you to frame the conversation by telling us what is endurance and are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we call this endurance adaptation sure the way I want to start actually here is is is calling back to some of the things we talked about in our previous conversations which are really people have exercise for three reasons number one you want to feel better number two you want to look a certain way and then number three you want to be able to do that for a long time right so you need the way that we say it in sports is look good feel good play good right so I want some sort of functionality to be able to perform a certain way whatever that is for you you want to be able to look a certain way that whatever that matters for you and then you want to be able to do that for a long time so when it comes to endurance we have a bunch of misnomers here which is the same thing with the strength training and resistance exercise side where we wanted to dispel this myth that I lift weights only because I I want to gain muscle or play a sport and I want to do cardio because I want to either lose fat or for long Health sake and just like we smashed that myth from the strength training side I want to smash it from the endurance training side there are so many other reasons that you want to perform endurance training regardless of your goal right whether it is longevity whether it is performance or whether it is Aesthetics and so we're going to I want to cover all those reasons uh exactly what to do Protocols of course and why those things are working that way in general though the quick answer is really endurance comes down to two independent factors Factor number one is fatigue management and then Factor number two is fueling and that's all it really comes down to so all the different types of training are going to reach a limitation which are either again your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue and that's generally a fatigue signal the other one is managing some sort of restriction of energy input and a lot of the spoiler here is a lot of the times people think it's a fueling issue and really it's a fatigue management issue or the opposite and to have a complete Health Spectrum regardless of whether you're a high performance athlete like I typically deal with or general public you need to be able to do both manage fatigue as well as understand fuel storage so that's really what we're going to get into today fantastic I can't wait before we dive in I'm going to ask you what I often ask people who are expert in their respective fields which is is there any nonobvious tool or mechanism or tool end mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance you know when I think about training for endurance again I think about trying to run longer and longer each week or Swim further and further and so on but I do wonder whether or not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance sure the way I want to answer this is if we look back and think about how we've answered that question with power and strength uh and force production it is really about how much can you produce maximally once what you're asking now is how can I repeat that same quality of performance if that's the case endurance really comes down to your ability to maintain proper mechanics that's going to like the biggest way we can increase your endurance exponentially very quickly is mechanical and this is starting with breathing and so we need to be breathing properly we need to have proper posture and positions and then we need to be moving well efficiency is going to Trump Force always for endurance the other of the equation it's not that you can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics and still squat well or jump high and be fine because you don't have to suffer those consequences repeatedly right that's going to drain you over time so uh the quickest way to improve urance is to improve mechanics and the mechanical thing I would go after first is your breathing techniques your pattern your entire approach as well as your posture and then from there the third one would be your movement technique is it possible to describe the best way to breathe when doing endurance training or is it more complex than that and if it is far more complex than that then certainly we can get into it during today's episode yeah it is both of those I will give you a quick answer though a lot of the times you can kind of Hit the cheat code which is nasal breathing there there's plenty of times when you don't want a nasal Brea or don't need you nasal breathe but just again as like a one tool that is a for a pretty General answer if you can do that a lot of the times that will fix breathing mechanics just by default and we can maybe talk about why that is later but that would be my sort of one sentence bullet point answer immediately uh of how to get in the right positions the second one would be simply looking at your posture right so whether you're on a bike or you're uh doing a lift or you're running if you're literally uh hunched over and your ribs are touching your femur or getting closer and closer like uh tends to happen on a bike or an air assault thing for somebody I've seen recently this morning I was on the assault bike um doing a a Sprint um and I asked Andy Dr Galpin to uh critique my form and anything else he wanted to critique so that I could improve and he did comment on my rather c-shaped posture correct um encourag me to uh be more upright which I should probably do now as well and he also queued me to the fact that during a one minute Sprint there is something that is quote unquote magic that happens right about the 42nd Mark yeah and I use that as a um as a milestone uh to look for and indeed something does happen at the 40 second into a one minute Sprint where all of a sudden it it does seem to get much easier for reasons I don't understand maybe you can tell that but it certainly had nothing to do with my posture my posture needs Improvement thank you well yeah so um breathing mechanics and breathing strategies uh people tend to be over breathing early on and this is going to lead to problems later so having a more strategic breathing pattern uh and approach is again a very quick solution I know that we're going to dive very deep into the mechanisms of Energy and Metabolism and endurance today but as long as we're having a discussion about these um brief sort of tidbits of how to improve endurance are there any other ways to improve endurance that are of relatively shorttime investment even if they require a lot of um energy sure the classic Paradigm you're going to find here is steady state long duration posed up against what a lot of folks will now call higher intensity interval training specifically and there's a lot of misconception here the quick answer is you need to be doing both and there's probably a bunch of stuff in between that you should be practicing if you honestly want to maximize those three factors we talked about at the beginning you need to be training across this full spectrum just like I told you to train across the full spectrum of your lifting we want to be doing the same thing here so are there independent special factors that can happen with the shorter Tim length higher intensity stuff absolutely there's also magic that happens on the other end of that Spectrum so it's very important that people don't just choose one side because what tends to happen is people either go with the oh I'm going to do 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff that's it or I'm going to do the opposite which I'm going to leave that stuff on the table not do it because I only want to do high intensity intervals because I can get it done in five minutes so there's Magic on both sides of the equation we want to get into all that but just to answer your question directly there's a whole bunch of of things you can do um in under one minute um that are convenient to do and there's a a wonderful set of papers um out of a couple Laboratories in Canada that that championed this idea that's called exercise snacks so there's a bunch of there's a series of studies that have been done here that are really interesting and they've looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy one of them is a 20 second bout of all out work and this is actually done in workers in an office and so what they had them do is run upstairs and I believe it was about 60 steps is is what it took them something along the order of 20 seconds exactly and they repeated that um about once every four hours so really it's you go to work you get you know put your coffee in your bag down whatever you run up a flight of stairs 20 seconds later then you go right back to work at lunch and before you go home you sort of repeat it there um and if you repeat that that's multiple times a week you're going to do that I think they in one of the interventions it was three times a week for six weeks 18 total times you did that and what you'll see is um a noticeable Improvement and this is statistically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory Fitness specifically V2 Max as well as a number of cognitive benefits his work productivity Etc that can happen in as little as 20 seconds you don't have to go to the gym you don't have to shower you don't have to do anything like that just find the stairs um run up and down them a few times now you may have noticed um you actually sort of caught me yesterday I did that right here right I was just I we had a little bit of a break I was feeling an energy lull I ran up the stairs three or four times felt a lot better so that can actually also help they ran another study where they looked at that following a Jun giant high glycemic index meal and what they saw and they took insulin measures and and a whole bunch of um other biological markers Associated that you want to be pay attention to with the high glycemic index meal and they looked at those immediately an Hour 3 hours 6 hours and sub post and it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post plal glucose control insulin and a whole bunch of other factors um in addition to that so if you are the sort of type who's like wow I'm in an office all day maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal not the best approach but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds so there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion if one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work could they do jumping jacks absolutely I mean you could do anything you really wanted um it's not the mode of exercise that matters here it is simply the exertion um you just get up as as hard as you can you could do burpees you could do any number of things um you could Sprint down your road down the hallway back and forth um the mode is is just U something that was easy for the scientist to control and X number of steps people could do it you're not going to fall hurt yourself things like that just to remind me it's once every four hours one minute of all 20 seconds oh 20 seconds excuse me uh 20 seconds of essentially all out exertion yep while remaining safe not going so fast up the stairs or doing jumping jacks so fastly not down the stairs up the stairs please um escalators don't count well I suppose they count if they're uh you know if if you're moving uh if you're not remaining on the same steps um in fact in an airport recently I saw somebody walking against the the conveyor yeah while talking on the phone while waiting for their flight to take off and I thought it's genius right it looked a little awkward who cares yeah but it was uh I have looked awkward in every airport I've been in for the last 15 years for these exact reasons doing wild stuff like that yeah well nothing's more Awkward than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far carrying a couple of suitcases there you go yeah that's the the other fit test the suitcase carrier in the airport I love this so once every four hours 20 seconds so maybe once when arriving to work once 4 hours in and then four hours and most people are probably at work somewhere you eight plus or minus two hours now one thing I actually really want to make clear because your audience is so incredible um they tend to to be really excited about these protocols and they follow them exactly it's written that's not exactly how science works so it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours it doesn't have to be three times a day it doesn't have to be 20 seconds they literally built that protocol because it was they're trying to replicate a real life scenario maybe you're in an office building you're generally there for eight hours Let's see if you did one every sort of at um so if you want to do it four times a week great if you can do it only 10 seconds amazing like you're probably going to get the same benefits those are not the details to pay attention to the detail to pay attention to is every so often multiple times a day try to get your heart rate up really quickly doesn't require sweating doesn't require anything else there's no warm-up associated with it um again you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can Sprint up them I do this all the time in my house when you you know have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run to my garage which is over there I hop on the the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in love it yeah I'm gonna start yeah just also you can just put one of those things which I do also just put one in your office and hop over right over there you know the whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is also separate from Dr Andy galpin's teaching and research rols at Cal State Fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentus momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality the hubman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentus for several important reasons first of all as I mentioned their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you're going to develop a supplementation protocol you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and costeffective supplementation regimen for your goals in addition moment to supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the hubman Lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States if you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the hubman Lab podcast in particular supplements for Hormone Health for Sleep optimization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to live momentus spelled ous so that's liv.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood glucose level is critical for everything from Fat Loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most people do not know however how different foods and different activities including exercise or different temperatured environments impact their blood glucose levels and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things I first started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels and I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels it's taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels. link huberman that's levels. link huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyt sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake but what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine if you exercise and in particular if you're following a very Clean Diet that is not a lot of processed foods which of course is a good thing chances are you're not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science spack ratio of 1,000 milligrams that's 1 gram of sodium 200 Mig of potassium and 60 milligram of magnesium and no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's LM nt.com huberman to get a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lmnt / huberman to claim a free sample pack so tell me about endurance what is endurance how do I get more endurance and how does it work when we think about endurance I would like to open up the conversation to include more things than people generally do when they hear the word endurance so if we just think about what you typically ask your body to do or would like to ask your body to do and we just walk through them it's going to be things like this number one I want to have energy throughout the day that's actually form of endurance great I don't want to have these lulls and fatigue and I want to feel fantastic as I move throughout my activities of daily living whatever those may be work exercise enjoyment cogn paying attention focus all that stuff great that's one thing another thing you want to ask your body to do is I want to be able to repeat some small effort in a muscle group and not and feel great about that this is what we generally call muscular endurance so this is something like I want to be able to walk up those 10 flights a step and my quads aren't burning at the end of it right or it even gives me energy another thing you want to ask your body to do is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work for a longer period of time something in the realm of you know 20 to 80 seconds so this could be something like if you're surfing and you've got to paddle extremely hard for a minute to get on on top of a wave or you want to you got you're out riding your bike and you need to be able to get up a hill and it's a very Steep Hill these are going to take maximal efforts um for for some small amount of time and then you'll get back up there we tend to call that maximum Anor robic capacity so that the max amount of work you can perform at a higher rate for some amount of seconds to like maybe a minute past that is your ability to repeat an effort kind of like that for something like 5 to 15 minutes and this is the example would be run a mile right some some interval like that which is a longer distance right um that is going to be your maximum aerobic capacity right and another thing you're going to want your body to do is what we call sustained position so this is you want to be able to sit in your chair at work and have perfect posture for 20 30 40 minutes right you want to be able to stand in line at a grocery store for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture so you want to be able to maintain position when you're riding your bike you're not collapsing you're doing any of these activities and you don't get hurt or lose efficiency simply because you couldn't sustain basic positions all right whatever those shapes and positions need to be okay and then the last one is a a maximum distance so we want to be able to go for a longer hike or have just a long day at Disneyland for whatever it needs to be and feel great at the end of it right so the goal with all of these things is not can you just do them but can you do them and then you feel good afterwards so we're back in a right position where they give you energy you feel good about it and it's not just something you had to do and you regretted and you felt awful so those are the factors I think about when someone says I want better endurance is I I want to walk backwards and say okay when you say endurance what do you mean and that's generally the things I've come across is if you can handle all of those things you're going to feel like you're in fantastic shape you're going to feel your recovery is going to be excellent and your physical performance in the gym or in any of the sporting activities you do will be enhanced given what you told us a little bit earlier that endurance really reflects fatigue and management and energy production how do each and both of those things relate to endurance at a mechanistic level really what I'm asking is what is fatigue management and what is energy production in order to do that it's important that we understand all of those functional capacities that I just talked about they all have different points of failure okay so in order to then work backwards and say well how do I optimize my performance in all those categories we need to go through each one and figure out well where am I failing some of them are going to be failing because of fatigue management and some of them will be failing because of energy production issues so if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy and how we handle fatigue then we're going to have a better understand of exactly what to do for each one of these categories if you feel like one of them in particular is uh worse for you or lagging behind or if in general you just want to improve all of them all right now I going to make a little bit of a 90 degree turn here I'm going to do it with strategy though I promise and I want to ask you a very simple question how do you lose weight I was taught that the calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more than I burn then I'll gain weight sure that is the approach you would take what I'm asking really is how are you actually physically losing the weight so my understanding is that we have different fuel sources in the body glycogen which is stored in muscle and liver body fat which is sort in mainly white adapost tissue and which is subcutaneous and around our organs intrav visceral fat and that we can also use protein as a fuel and then as I recall there's also a phosphocreatine system and I think you're going to tell me that each of these systems is tapped into on different time scales and perhaps according to different levels of exertion and I'm certain that what I just said is not exhaustive but hopefully it is most or entirely correct pretty correct what's that got to do with fat loss uh at some point uh body fat stores atos adipocytes fat cells are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source and the stimulus for that I'm assuming is going going to be that other fuel sources are either depleted or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body I don't want to say decide because they don't have their own Consciousness but are um are flip are signaling in a way that registers that uh body fat would be the optimal fuel source given how long or int Andor intensely a given activity has been performed okay we have some stuff to clean up there but we're still not really answering the question how am I actually losing that body fat uh how is it actually leaving the body correct uh my understanding is that it leaves the body through respiration aha so now we have some interesting things to talk about how am I actually losing fat via respiration what the hell does that even mean how is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me leaving my body through my mouth and there there's a very clear answer there right which I'm I'm sure you're queued up to when you take take a breath in you're generally breathing in oxygen O2 there's some other things but we'll just stick to oxygen when you exhale you're breathing out CO2 the difference between those two is that carbon molecule well one of the things that's important to understand here is all of your carbohydrates which is that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated so it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule it is a simple chain of carbons your fat molecules are also chains of carbon all of metabolism really in terms of energy production is simply trying to figure out a way to break those carbon bonds as a result we get energy from that we use that energy to create a molecule called ATP which is the central source of energy for any living being right that carbon is then floating around in free form which is bad news internally so we've got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our system so all of energy production all of fatigue management really comes down to this core issue of how are we handling car carbon and how are we moving it around the body and so what we do is we do this sneaky thing so another question I like to ask people is why do we breathe well for two reasons uh to bring oxygen into the system and to offload carbon dioxide but the neural trigger for breathing is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level in the set of neurons in the brain stem and elsewhere uh activate the frenic nerve or the gasp reflex or a combination of things and we inhale or inhale right so a reduction of oxygen intake generally doesn't stimulate ventilation unless you're at altitude then that sort of changes right in general it's an elevation in CO2 that's going to stimulate breathing off the only reason you bring in O2 for the most part is to get rid of the CO2 oxygen is not a fuel source it is not a way it works the same with fire by the way so you know you have to have oxygen present for a fire to go and if you squelch oxygen the fire will go out right that's about half of um how those like fire extinguishers work but we think then that means oxygen is the fuel it is not the fuel it is something entirely different it is a necessary Pro is a product that is necessary for the metabolism process to actually occur all right so we're kind of dancing around an idea here which is this carbon cycle of life so what happens in plants is they generally will breathe in the opposite and breathe out the opposite of humans so a plant will bre breathe in CO2 and exhale O2 right this is why we have to have a certain amount of these things and algae and forests and trees and stuff to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in our atmosphere we do the opposite and so we have this wonderful circle of life we breathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do the opposite well what happens is because carbohydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well generally when we think about fats by the way it's important to understand that structure a little bit so if we think about triglycerides um is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol so 1 two three and horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains right so we form this structure that looks like an e right like the letter e three in the back and then three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon right a number of carbons strung together however many carbons are there determines which type of fatty acid it is right so steric acid lunic acid like any different number of things it's also what determines whether or not is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated is if um carbon requires a special thing called a double bond so if there's a double bond across every carbon of carbon then they're all fully saturated and you're great if there's any of them that are not double bonded in fact in example if there is one that doesn't have a double bond that is now called Mono unsaturated and if there are many it is called polyunsaturated so there's pros and cons to all these things right in either case we're still talking long carbon chains so what a plant will is bring in carbon and then it has this wonderful ability to use energy from the sun called photosynthesis and it can take those carbons that it inhales and use the energy from the Sun to form a bond now in our prior discussion when we were uh going over hypertrophy we talked about the energy was required to go through protein synthesis that's because forming a new atom or a new bond between atoms often times takes energy in these cases it does the same thing happens here so if a plant does not have oxygen or does not have carbon dioxide in the air it has no fuel the basically think about it is that's what it eats it needs to get nitrogen from the ground in the soil it's like we need to get nitrogen from our protein but fuel-wise it needs to get carbon dioxide then it needs sun to give it energy so it it can actually form that Bond right that's where it's getting its fuel from all right so if we think about um a classic uh plant produ the plant that produces either a starch or a fruit here's what happens it inhales that carbon and it starts packing it away now in a root vegetable what it does is it stores those things together and if we store that thing and we grow fruit at the bottom of it we tend to call those things starches all right it's going to then take the carbon that is packed away in its root and send it up the tree and it's going to actually do that by breaking it down into a smaller form of carbohydrate that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose it'll ship that up the tree it'll go out to the leaves and it'll convert it into the fruit and it's going to eventually transform that stuff into smaller carbon things called fructose and if we think about the fruit or the sugar in fruit it's often in the form of fructose or sucrose or a combination and sometimes glucose so we have these smaller carbon six carbon chains generally in the form of glucose that are being made from this larger storage of U carbohydrates that we call um starch right so it's packed in together your body does the exact same thing so if it's a potato and it has a whole bunch of glucose packed away we call that starch if it's in your quadricep and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose Away We Now call it glycogen if it's in your blood as that six carbon chain we call it glucose if it's in the tree and in the fruit we call it fructose right those are different molecules but that's effectively the same thing happen so the biology or the chemistry is almost identical it just runs in the reverse order and that's why again tubers and potatoes and stuff tend to be starches and fruits tend to be glucose fructose and sucrose so we have this wonderful Circle of Life the plants can survive on just breathing in the CO2 and then getting the energy from the Sun we don't have that ability at least to my knowledge to run through photosynthesis so the only way we can get carbon into our system is that actually ingest carbon which means we have to eat the starch the fruit the animal some other form of stored carbon to get that into our system we then pack that away we put the carbohydrates as you mentioned earlier either in our liver our blood or in our muscles we put the fat generally in adapost tissue we'll put a little bit in muscle cells as intramuscular triglycerides and then the protein we use as structure right to do different things we don't like to use protein is material or fuel it's it's better use this structure and what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our body in other words we're gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right anytime we're trying to break a carbon bond that we can get energy to make ATP that's going to release the carbon out of our tissue into the blood we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule to make CO2 so we can exhale it and put it back into the atmosphere that's a beautiful description of the circle of life and energy utilization in the human body I have to ask the question that I'm sure many people are wondering about which is if indeed we exhale these carbons and as it relates to Fat Loss that is the way that we lose fat if we're in a sub caloric state for instance has it ever been explored as to whether increasing the duration or intensity of exhales can accelerate fat loss I mean that's sort of The Logical extension of what you described and here I'm actually interested uh equally in whether or not the answer is yes as well as whether it could be no because I could imagine if the answer is yes well then there's some interesting protocols to emerge from that but that if it's no it will reveal to us some important bottlenecks about metabolism and energy utilization you ever seen the those magicians who like show up and uh they can tell your mom's name or something like that before you because they can sort of lead you down a path yeah I mean not to take us down a deep dive tangent but I once went to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles and I was one of the people called up front and a in an incredible magician named um I think his name was Azie mind or something uh I think that's right had me write my name on a card in a Sharpie pen I ripped up the card I ripped it up I put it in my pocket and at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bout of him doing a bunch of other tricks he asked me to look in my right shoe and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact yeah and it was no longer in my pocket and I swear in my life I wasn't a a collaborator with him and it to this day it still gives me chills because it well I I don't know how magic yeah right magic well the reason I say that is I've given that little Spiel that I just gave you that countless times in my classes and I would say 99% of the time as soon as I stop the very first question is so can I just like do a bunch of exhales and lose fat which is wonderful because I was really hoping you would do that and you rolled right into my trap right you landed perfectly so I I look like a like a a magician over here I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now no I asked the question because it's the it's the logical extension of what you laid out but I know biology to be um both uh diabolical and cryptic but also Exquisite in the way that things are arranged and you don't get something for nothing there are no free passes in physiology that's the saying no free passes um the answer to your question is yes 100% yes in fact that is the only way to go about it you have two options you can ingest less carbon or you can expel more carbon people always say calories in calories out it's really carbon in carbon out that's that's what a calorie is Right calorie is the amount of energy we get per breaking a carbon Bond so it's really Less in Le more out less in is fairly obvious whether that comes in any form and by the way this is exactly why the percentage of your intake coming from fats or carbohydrated such it doesn't really matter that much if you look at fat loss um clinical trials you guys may have covered this when Lane was in here I'm sure like this is something he talks about a lot it doesn't matter it's irrelevant because it's not about that there's nothing magic in those things they are different they have different physiological responses everything is different right no doubt but in general it's just simply about carbon intake turns out fat has a lot more carbons per mole than carbohydrates do so there's more calories per mole in there so if you the physical amount of fat needs to come in as a smaller amount physical amount of carbohydrates needs to come in will come in as a larger amount but you can play any number of very high carb low fat what matters total calories right again it's not like the only thing that matters but you know what I'm saying some percentages in the way can go fat loss Works fantastic high fat low carbohydrate why why why do all these things work because it's not about that it's about total intake of carbon total XEL so absolutely can you lose fat by simply exhaling more in fact that is exactly what you did this morning when I hopped on the aird bike for when you did anything right the question is can you think of a scenario in which you could have a bunch of increased rates of exhalation that helps in Fat Loss sure I can think of a lot of things that will stimulate increased rates of inhal exhalation one thing could be simply going right and so the question is like can I literally do some breath protocols where I force exhale and lose fat and the answer is yes but what happened what happens if you do hyperventilation training well my lab studies cyclic hyperventilation is one of our many uh deliberate protocols and one of the most prominent things that one observes is that levels of adrenaline increase very quickly extremely quickly people feel jittery anxious stressed and unless they are consciously trying to Anchor their thinking about what that means and the benefits that to persisting typically they abort the cyclic hyperventilation protocol really quickly within seconds right you will feel tingling sweating all kinds of things you're hyperventilating right and we could we could talk in nauseum about how that changes everything from adrenaline to focus a whole bunch of things so unfortunately a strategy of sitting around just exhaling more than you inhale technically helps you lose more fat but it's not going to last very long so then the question is well how do I get into a situation or a scenario in which I can increase my rate of expiration when where I'm not going to pass out and I'm not going and altering hypocapnia and hypercapnia issues any idea of a situation in which you would have an enhanced rate of expolation without worrying about passing out sure I steady state exercise or not steady state exercise lifting weights intervals moderate training repeated any of these things they all work equally for fat loss because all they're doing is increasing respiration rate they're saying increase demand for energy increased exhalation that's the trick here and when you equate these things to that they have equal success in fat loss it doesn't matter theoretically where you're getting it from and so when we get into this idea of well what are the best training strategies for fat loss it doesn't matter which one of these tactics you pick as long as you maintain consistent adherence over time because of this exact fact it doesn't matter matter if you're burning quote unquote fat in the exercise session or if you're burning carbohydrates in the exercise session it is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time okay now there's some significant misconceptions there about what I just talked and I I would love to come back and walk through that in more detail but that's the main take home message here it won't matter what's coming in and it won't matter what's coming out because in either case it is the same rate of oxygen in n CO2 out that's the key metric and hopefully this helps a lot of people have some relief because they're like man you're so tied up on what is the exact protocol for training for optimizing fat loss what's the exact nutritional intervention I need for fat loss and then you wonder why all these different diets can work effectively and wonder why all these different training protocols you know surely you know somebody who lost a bunch of weight and the only thing they did is they just started running there was no Advanced protoc they just started running they ran 5 miles every day that works and then tons of people who tried that and like didn't lose anything and lots of people who went to I went to cardio kit Boxing class lost weight oh I just started doing intervals on my why why mysteriously do all these things work there there you have something has some spidey sense have to has to be going off in your brain we're like there has to be something linking these things and what's linking it is simply carbon exchange so put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out the other problem is if you were to Simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction so that's the problem is your net carbon output over the course of the day is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy and that's how you get into that negative State along these lines of exhaling carbons uh as the route for fat loss makes me wonder whether or not increasing lung capacity is possible I'm guessing the answer is yes and whether or not increasing lung capacity is a good goal and route to enhancing fat loss essentially what I'm asking is if you can offload more CO2 okay carbons per exhale are you a more efficient fat loss machine it's a wonderful thought and the answer would be no not something need to worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency you're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity the heart has a metric called cardiac output this is in science we abbreviate this as Q for some odd reasons it's either Co or q and cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume so it's how many beads per minute you're having as well as how much blood's coming out of it so cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs if you try to work around that it's just going to adjust itself so what I mean by this is if you were able to increase your stroke volume the amount of blood coming out per pump you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate so that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands so you're sort of pushing one end of the of the spectrum but your body will pull the other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral level so um if you look at if you think about like cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training any type of endurance training a common thing people will understand is resting heart rate and so what that number is is just how many beats per minute you're having when you're sitting here doing nothing a very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time um as general numbers what you will hear is people will say things like a a normal resting heart rate is between 60 to 80 beats per minute and you know if any of the things I've talked about um with the individuals I work with I don't work with anybody with disease just to clarify that I don't do anything with disease management treatment anything it's always about people who are in a good spot who want to optimize or get to the next level whether this is professional athletes trying to to to Peak for physical performance or uh the folks in our rapid Health optimization program that feel good again it's not disease stuff and they want to feel incredible one of the metrics we're going to pay attention to is this resting heart rate so here's what happens as you improve your endurance your resting heart rate will go down if I see somebody over 70 beats per minute um unless something's going on you're not physically fit regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote within the normative values I want to see everybody sub 60 beats per minute or close right and that is not a difficult thing to really get to for most people so if you train a lot regardless of how you train intervals steady state doesn't matter that resting heart rate will come down but since energy demands at rest haven't really changed cardiac output stays the same so what happens is stroke volume goes up so literally like we trained your quadriceps on the leg exension machine to get stronger so you can produce more Force per contraction the heart will do the exact same thing and so as you're able to get more of the blood out of your heart per pump the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often so that's the compensatory adaptation which is saying hey look I don't need to beat 60 times a minute I now need to beat 55 times a minute because I'm getting the same amount of Blood Out per pump chill and this is why your wrestling heart rate goes down your resting stroke volume goes up but your cardiac output is identical so that's not a good metric of Fitness it's going to stay the same cardiac output will only adjust per energetic changes all right uh energy requirements in the acute moment right how much do I need go which is going to be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a submaximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit to where you're super fit at submax you're going to see the same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower and that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher where it gets people tripped up is at Max because you may not see much of a change at Max um because you won't really you don't really see an increase in maximum heart rate with Fitness that's not a thing right so maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for fit or unfit or anything like that um stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart it has to have so much time to fill up with blood before it can contract again and squeeze the blood out and when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute that just doesn't leave much time to fill and so it won't really push you past that so um don't worry about trying to increase your maximum heart rate that's not necessarily a good thing and it won't really change but your cardiac output will because stroke volume will be higher but that doesn't necessarily mean that I should avoid training that gets me up toward maximum heart rate correct oh you should absolutely do it right that's what that was my assumption I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens daily since 2012 so I'm

Metabolism so we've got these different modes of moving energy making and breaking energy Bonds in the body moving energy into different tissues and out of different tissues and indeed out of the body through exhalation how do each of these different modes of energy utilization relate to different modes of movement and exercise yeah in my mind I'm starting to draw a bridge between okay when I walk for 60 minutes you know if I'm talking I'm breathing a bit more maybe I'm burning a little more fat after all speech is is a modified exhale um and amazing if I'm sprinting I'm breathing differently and if I'm um you know doing a 30 minute moderate quote unquote moderate jog I'm breathing differently so you've beautifully Illustrated this bridge between energy production and utilization and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation what are some of the specifics about energy utilization according to different modes of exercise and if we could better Define modes of exercise or types of exercise that trigger specific adaptations I think this is where the the bridge will move from being a a mere line to a real structure yeah absolutely I want to lay one more foundational piece and then it's going to be much easier to understand the limitations I put on some of these training protocols as well as the lack of limitations okay so it's really really important um the way I want to start this is we have this this Foundation now of of carbon and and basic energy production that's not to say there's no difference there is and that difference is important but maybe we can answer the question from earlier which is actually something you asked me this morning when we were exercising you're like training fasted right does training fasted enhance fat loss and the logic is sound if I don't have any fuel then I should be burning more fat therefore I should be losing more fat it's sound it's not true is this great idea it's one of these classic things in science and exercise phys physiology where like sounds good turns out it's not it's actually a pretty gross misunderstanding of metabolism so it's not to pick on that topic I don't really care about that topic but it is a it's a common question it also gives me an opportunity to just tell you more about metabolism so here's what happen you are breathing in O2 and breathing out CO2 however the ratio to that is what we call the either reer respiratory exchange ratio or RQ respiratory quotient and I'm not going to differentiate those two they're not the same thing but we're going to skip past that for now as you begin to increase exorcise intensity the percentage of o2 to CO2 rises in the favor of CO2 so you start breathing out way more CO2 than you are breathing in O2 right and so if we were to look at that number you know what's the relationship it goes up so at rest most people have a a of a value that we would typically call something like 0.6 okay and that's again the relationship between O2 and CO2 maybe 0.7 if you were to go for a walk that increases slightly because you're now expiring CO2 at a higher rate so now you've moved up to say 08 or something like that one of the ways that we Mark somebody of achieving an actual V2 Max on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1 one now any of you who are paying attention are thinking well wait a minute how the hell can a ratio between two things ever get past one well that's because you're getting into a place where you're actually offloading more CO2 than is actually necessary and this is what actually causes and explains a thing that people like to call Epoch which is excess exercise post oxygen consumption this is another way to think about it the only reason you're breathing is to bring in oxygen an offload CO2 right if I'm no longer exercising why am I still breathing in other words once you stop the demand or the need for for energy you should stop ventilating but you don't right that's because in the case of low intensity exercise the second you stop you're right back down to resing ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with the offload of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you can't do that so you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here so even though you're done exercising you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back and pay that back by that I specifically mean you have to bring in oxygen because you have a whole bunch of waste that's been accumulating in your tissue that you've got to deal with and I I'll walk you through what that waste is it's a particular molecule that a lot of people have heard of but grossly misunderstand so you got to be able to handle that so the reason that you sit there and go and continue to ventilate is because you're now trying to pay back that excess post exercise oxygen debt that's that oxygen debt we're specifically talking about all right so that being said as we start cruising up that RQ starts going up up up up up up up and if we get to one you're 1.0 you're you're in a like you're hurting you're you're in a pretty good spot all right I like that you're hurting you're in a pretty good spot yeah there a a window into Dr Andy galpin's mind now you really want to be a subject in his uh his laboratory studies sure masochist swarm to Andy's lab absolutely all right so the idea that I will lose more fat by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat it seems to make sense but it's a massive failure to understand the metabolism it's the exact same explanation to why exercising fasted doesn't matter so the exercising fasted issue under normal circumstances is irrelevant because you have plenty of fuel in the system even when you haven't eaten breakfast that morning now if you're talking like extended fasting over multiple days this is a different scenario if muscle glycogen liver glycogen and blood glucose are at sufficient levels then you absolutely have enough energy to perform almost any type of exercise that most people are doing you know maybe if you're Rob and you're at Mile 20 today it's a different story but the vast majority of us have PL fuel sitting around so we're not going to burn more into fat just because we didn't eat breakfast that morning so that just doesn't make energetic sense we have a lot of backup supplies you're never out the trick here is this is there's a there's a concept here we call crossover concept so as we are starting to move up exercise intensity we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel from carbohydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat I'm sleeping that's the highest percentage of your fuel that will be coming from fat of any activity you could ever do so if the theory that I'm going to stay at a lower intensity to burn more fat was true the optimal fat burning strategy would been be to sleep like that doesn't make sense of course it doesn't so why would then going at a slightly elevated rate somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat it doesn't actually make sense when you think about it that way you're like oh yeah there's no way so it's a percentage trick it's a difference between absolute and relative this is what this confusion is so yes as you start doing lower intensity exercise whether you're faster or not it's irrelevant but lower intensity exercise a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat however your total fuel expenditure is very low so that whole total carbon balance is not really being shifted much as you start exercising in a very high intensity you actually start getting a higher percentage of your fuel from carbohydrate and a lower percentage from fat in fact at rest about the highest you can get in most people is about 60% of your fuel from fat as you're sleeping you might be 70% but you'll never be in a position ever no matter what sort of thing you've heard on the internet you'll never be in a situation where fat is your only fuel source the highest I probably ever seen is like 70% um you should probably be at about that's that's a kind of a good number to think um honestly but people will who understand a little bit about metab metabolism to be dangerous but not enough we will throw out these terms like fat adapted and fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding often times right it is this idea thinking like I can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all right that's the confusion so if you enhance fat oxidation in an exercise that does not enhance fat loss per se right so this is a lot of the confusion that's happening right so as we start moving up we can never get in a position where we're using fat only as a fuel again at best you're at 70% fat 30% carbohydrate for a lot of reasons we probably just don't have time to get into today however the opposite is possible when you get into true high-intensity exercise you'll be basically 100% carbohydrate and 0% fat right that is is very possible that in fact is 1.0 that's what R 1.1 is actually because your ventilation got so high you actually exceeded that number even though you're at 100% carbohydrate this is what people came up with the idea then it's like Wella I don't want to burn carbs I want to lose fat so my response to that is always like okay great so makes sense burning fat losing fat burning carbs is losing what then like you think your liver shrunk like like wait a minute what did you lose then where did it come from it's all coming as carbon don't worry about where it came from for your fuel it just has to come out as carbon right there are differences in exercise efficiency for performance with our professional athletes of course but if the only goal here is Fat Loss it doesn't matter where you get it from the last Bridge we have to connect here is like well wait a minute if I only burned carbohydrate how did I actually lose that fat there was there was that love handle sitting on the side of me how did that come out of me if I never burn that for my fuel what you're failing to understand is there's a balance game that happens here so if you were to do a bunch of high-intensity exercise training and you burned only muscle glycogen and blood glucose and maybe even you did it for so long you burned some liver glycogen the body understands that it has expelled a lot of energy from that side of the equation it's going to do a couple of things now it's very difficult to go through this fancy situation where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back and forth like that's actually like fairly hard what it's easier to do with something you said earlier is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source so in that scenario where you're down really low in your carbohydrate carbohydrate stores any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage and since your net energy expenditure is something that your body regulates a lot any fat that you then bring in is going to be utilized as a fuel source because it knows it doesn't need it anymore that is an access so that's how you actually use fat as a fuel because you've burned down carbohydrate storages as I'm hearing this uh a couple of things come to mind first of all thank you for that in incredibly important description of what is otherwise a very confusing landscape for most people one of the key points I took away and I just want to say from the outset this is not exhaustive by any stretch is that burning fat F does not equal losing fat from the body correct and then burning fat has to be divided into burning of body fat stores and we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat that is brought in correct oftentimes people don't disambiguate those correct right and I'm also understanding that reducing one's body carbohydrate stores muscle glycogen liver glycogen Etc occurs during high-intensity exercise yep as well as other ways but that is one very efficient way to tap into those stores which makes me wonder again this is one of these things that does it lead to a protocol makes me wonder whether or not doing high-intensity let's say weight training for 45 to 60 Minutes 75 minutes of strength training power training hypertrophy training which we've covered in an episode about those topics and then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise is there any benefit to that arrangement that would quote unquote enhance body fat loss from the body to be very specific now because unlike the idea that training fasted would shift the bias towards fat loss which it doesn't you've told us under those conditions muscle glycogen and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted put simply can I enhance body fat loss by doing some cardio after a b of weight training if you equate for total energy expenditure it won't matter now you did bring up a very important point that I want to clarify if you look at the exercise modalities that we laid out in our previous uh conversations we talked about nine different adaptations one was skill and then speed power strength hypertrophy muscular endurance Anor robic capacity aerobic capacity and long duration endurance now speed power and skill development have almost no benefit for fat loss because remember those are low weight a lot of rest and low volume they're not really really going to be helpful you can make a little bit of a case for strength a little bit but the total energy expenditure for strength training even if it's an hour if it's truly strength training it's fairly low because the repetitions are in the one to three range that's exactly it's not enough for total work so if you're trying to develop a protocol that sort of optimizes fat loss what you want to do you were close in my opinion is to a combination of something in the hypertrophy slm muscular endurance strength training realm okay so um six to 30 repetitions something like that of resistance training great deplete muscle glycogen maybe even a bit of liver glycogen maybe a little bit depending on if you're doing it for a long time but probably not a noticeable amount okay so an hour of of uh hypertrophy type training if if you're training hard with low rests and you really did an hour you you would for sure get there but most people don't the reason why I crave large bowls of oatmeal and rice after I do weight training I want to replenish muscle glycogen totally right um then you maybe do a little bit of very high intensity maximum heart rate well over V2 Max uh hard as you can for 20 30 45 60 seconds something like that with some recovery a lot of recovery and repeated and that's going to do a great job of deplenish muscle glycogen right if you do that long enough you'll get the liver but again most people don't cuz it's really really hard to go that hard so liver is sort of last Last Resort yeah basic mechanics here which we'll which we'll actually get into as our like third segment here is um energy production comes from the local electrici muscle first and foremost from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores right and again and we store in a muscle we call it glycogen right that's just your first sign of light up defense if you need glucose outside of that you're going to start pulling it from the blood but one of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood pH blood glucose blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations like it really does not want to mess with those things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized right you generally because you need all those things for your brain to work and your brain will stop working right if you lose blood pressure it won't go up there pH changes you can't run metabolism electrolytes change you can't think and glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain it's going to be a problem right so if that number starts to come down because you're grabbing glucose out of the blood your liver is going to then kick in it's going to break down its glycogen to put glucose into the blood to keep the blood number the level in fact one of the things you'll see is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise they don't fall they in fact they rise as an anticipatory state if you train a lot your blood glucose will start going up before you start moving it knows it's coming right so you you can play that game you can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time until your liver runs out and that's what actually is a Bonk in terms of like long duration endurance stuff you're talking many many many miles several hours typically we say oh it's got to be over 2 hours um before your liver starts to become a real problem or it has to be tremendously intense because of those reasons you have to burn through just a lot of energy before your liver starts to get into a problem you can continue to train when your muscle glycogen levels are low in fact um people say glycogen depletion of muscle but it's it it's generally misnomer and you are going to have tremendous signals of fatigue when that gets lower than 75% so people think that like their muscles are getting heavy you you're probably still 75% full um a lot of folks will quit around the 50% the highest I've ever seen is like 95% true depletion and that's in extremely high level cross country skiers and like they're deltoid gets very very low some very talented Runners will get fairly low in their quads but the vast majority of folks by the time you're 50% depleted you're going to quit it's going to be really really challenging um so you're never really going to get that low it's like a bit of a protective mechanism right but when your liver getss low you're going to be shut down and that's the case of if you've ever been to like a marathon and you've seen people run like 25 and a half miles and then they just like Bonk they go into like baby deer walking stance and then they collapse and you're like how are you mentally weak like you ran 26 miles and you can't run the last point it ain't mentally weak it is if your liver is done it's going to stop you because there's no more backup reserves muscle you can get away with you can push through it liver will not let you go any farther I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder whether or not the liver being depleted sends a neural signal to the brain or or the brain must register some signal like I would like to be alive tomorrow thank you whatever is happening right now um stopping is going to be safer than continuing yeah and so that stop signal um is is one that I think a lot of people including myself are are intrigued by because we always think that it's uh related to willpower but the brain needs to preserve itself and the master computer I mean there are ways to go into kind of automaton type um you know not thinking just doing type uh Behavior you have override switches right and you can play those cards and you can get better at learning and be being less sensitive to that switch that's exactly what happened when you first start training right you start to realize like oh my gosh I'm super tired then you realize really quick like oh I'm I'm totally fine here and this is like the P pick pick your person who's made sayings like this but it's like you're really only 10% depleted or 30% % or 40% or some we're all operating at 40% of what we could do of course any of those things are true because it is like a little bit of an override um you've just gotten very sensitive to being a small percentage depleted and you've learned okay I'm tired and there is a long way to go past that but once you get past that and you flip that override switch a lot um you just you're going to break quickly because you you basically learn to ignore that signal and problems can happen really quickly after that and that's even experienced endurance athletes if you hit that level it's like you're going to be hitting the concrete next and that's you know potentially a problem I want to make sure I understand a concept that you referred to earlier correctly because I have a feeling that I don't and that's this issue of how the body accesses body fat stores MH when in a sub caloric State and I'm doing mainly glycogen burning exercise yeah what I heard you say and please correct me where I'm undoubtedly wrong what I heard you say was that okay I go into the gym and I start lifting weights I'm burning muscle glycogen mostly local to the muscles that I'm using and then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream maybe there's some body fat stores that are mobilized probably not dipping into my liver glycogen okay I complete the workout Maybe I even hop on the airdine bike and do a little Sprint I go for a jog maybe um I eat immediately afterward maybe I don't eat for a few hours afterwards but across the day I ingest fewer calories than I burn is it the case that body fat is mobilized in order to replace the glycogen that my sub caloric intake was insufficient to provide in other words because I didn't eat enough to fill the glycogen stores am I using body fat converted into glycogen to fill those stores right and if so is that a case where I'm no longer exhaling carbons in order to burn body fat but rather I'm repurposing body fat into muscle have I turned fat into muscle in that case yeah I'm I'm really glad um you asked this because I did a very poor job on that last Point talking about earlier um I'm realizing playing back in my head because that's so many really good questions you cannot turn fat into muscle can you turn muscle into fat no I'm so glad you said that because when I was in college yeah our I don't want to out that person the physiology teacher seemed to think still at that point that one could um lift weights get muscular but then it would eventually turn into body fat that that I that myth has I think largely been dispelled I heard that so many times uh as a kid I heard it so many times in college I heard it so I heard it so many times in our uh undergraduate students from other faculty and such so um no like they are not the same structures they are very different um let let me take a shout at answering this better you were really really really close so yeah if you were to do that type of exercise where you've burned a lot of musle glycogen how is it I'm losing stored fat right that's really the clock of the question and it doesn't even actually matter if you then went ahead and ingested exra uh carbohydrates or fat post exercise that's not really thing you h on a couple key things number one this is all under the assumption that total caloric intake is still low right you have below total need below total need right okay I also want to flag calories in calories out is not the only thing that matters this is a very complex thing calories in is incredibly complicated calories out is even more more complicated okay so we just maybe another series we can spend on that alone so don't don't go nuts about that you have to be hypochloric one way or the other if you burn a bunch of musle glycogen and you are hyper chloric you're still going to add fat if you burn a bunch of muscular glycogen and you're hypochloric you're going to lose fat right think about it this way you are in a negative calorie state where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently no no are you g to reduce your glycogen storage in your liver no you want to reduce blood glucose no no way right so where is that extra energy coming from it's coming from your stored fat it is your backup Reserve Energy System um the way that I want to flag this here is people tend to think about it as like carbohydrates versus fat that's not it's more like a chain more like a bicycle where there's a front gear and a back gear you turn one gear it turns the other one these are complimentary systems they are not and or systems right you're you're turning one and when we go through carbohydrate metabolism maybe here in a second you'll understand why you have to have an anerobic and an aerobic component to that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that has to happen the only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic and oxygen there's no anerobic component to it so there's a fundamental difference there so the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible it is the primary fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is meant to be unlimited that's the basic point so you want flexibility over here and then unlimited capacity over there now I'm safeguarded against any energetic need okay I need to run up a hill for safety cool carbohydrates are there I need to then run for 17 hours cool fat is there we want both of these systems um you want to be able ble to have great energy throughout the day you want a slow drip coming from fat you don't want up and down up and down feel great up and down awesome you want to be able to think very quickly and get hyperfocused boom carbohydrates ramp right up right get it into the brain get thinking better get thinking clearly fast so we want all these not just for exercise purposes for but for activities of daily living we want an optimal system here and when people use the terms like fat adapted they're generally hijacking that and thinking M it used to be a thing we said all the time and like all of my undergraduate classes for years and that idea of metabolic flexibility is using optimal fuel sources and optimal types not maximizing fat usage they the people have co-opted that term of metabolic flexibility to being like Oh yeah yeah therefore learn how to maximize fat burning that's not what that term means that term means maximizing your ability to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time now I'll Grant you most people aren't fantastic at using fat as a fuel source relative to the other direction but nonetheless the the the gold standard here should be maximizing both all right finally answering your question if I were to to burn a bunch of muscle glycogen how am I losing that fat well the fuel you're ingesting in that hypocaloric state is going to say hey look we have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish so any carbohydrate that comes in needs to be biased towards storage it's got to go into those tissue any fat that comes in or doesn't even come in but any fat that we're using using for fuel needs to be utilized for activity and that's where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in so you're basically saying your general physiology the energy for that starts coming from fat and the energy that's coming in from carbohydrate needs to be simply stored and so what you see is your respiratory quotient changes right the re is going is going off and so in the exercise moment it shot way up for carbohydrates and shot way down for fat as the compensatory response it goes the other direction because your body is saying we are low on carbohydrates don't use them for fuel unless we absolutely have to right so use them for storage get our fuel from the fat side of the equation and so what you're generally going to say is like oh I'm burning more fat just sitting around after things like that and that's not even taking into the equation the epoch part which is like it's it's not actually as large as people think it is it's fairly small but it is it adds up sort of over time so um does that explain a little bit better about how you lose fat when you actually only burn carbs for exercise yeah you explained it beautifully you talked about Epoch the post exercise oxygen consumption yeah not being that significant in terms of energy utilization even though today we're talking about endurance and different forms of endurance I do have to ask whether or not people consider the elevation in basil metabolism that occurs when there's more muscle around because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue um you know if is there a straightforward is equation you know if one adds one pound of of lean muscle tissue to their body even if it's distributed across multiple muscle groups does that equate to uh a caloric need of X number of calories per day Y and is that because the muscle protein synthesis needs of that muscle or its glycogen storage needs or both if you don't have enough muscle you start to have problems with fat loss it's it's difficult challenge if you have enough muscle uh and you're just trying to get extremely large if if your ffmi is 24 and you're 15% body fat adding more muscle is not really going to play a lot in the equation and here's why muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat but fat is not inert so fat is still going to burn a a small number of calories muscle burns more but it's not nearly what people think it is I'm a muscle guy I'm a muscle physiologist I would love to get people to have more muscle for any excuse I can it's not honest to say that though um you're talking about when I was in undergraduate we would say numbers like 50 kcals per day per pound is what you can look at right so if you put on a pound of muscle spread across the body your basil metabolic rate would go up by around 50 calories um per day I think that number is grossly exact exaggerated it's probably a tenth of that 6 to 10 calories maybe um it's it's hard to know exactly what that number is but the more recent estimates are are something like that so now on one hand you could say oh my gosh that is not even meaningful the other hand you could say that's super meaningful it just depends on time domain you want to put that out right so if you were to put on five pounds of muscle and your basil metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories a day well over the course of a thousand days like that adds up so you you could slice this any way you want um now maybe that number is somewhere in between I don't really know it's not a field I pay that much attention to candidly because it's it's not a metric kind of like Epoch um where it's like we used to really harp on it and now it's sort of like well maybe we exaggerated that like honestly just a bit but to me it doesn't change the equation much because if you don't have enough muscle as I describe there are other consequences that are going to make fat loss hard and so you need to have sufficient muscle if the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot great if it's something else I don't really care um there's just enough evidence that you need to have it or I should say there's enough evidence that it will really help you in your path um maybe a few calories here there is not really the thing especially if you understand a normal food item anything you pick is going to be probably a couple of hundred calories one bad food Choice a day will outkick almost any amount of coverage you got on a adding muscle mass to you so like you're you're really stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime if you're worried about how many calories you're getting from adding muscle um fat loss is going to be about regulating that carbon intake above and beyond anything else I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are of course but then also what sorts of Behavioral do and don'ts what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can visit insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off so I've heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times frankly you're the first person who's ever explained it to me in a clear and concise way how do I know if I am metabolically flexible and how do I increase my metabolic flexibility sure there's no specific standard which is actually a good thing right and so if you have a level of specificity that you want or need metabolically then you don't actually want to be in this Middle Ground an example would be if you are a performing in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs in a sport that is Gally dominated you don't want to be optimally metabolically flexible you don't want to be super quote unquote fat adapted you want to be biased towards the energy you're going to use the same could be true for the other end of the spectrum so in those particular cases it's not optimal to be equally effective because there are no free passes in physiology right your energy producing systems will upregulate or down regulate accordingly so you will actually limit your ability to say maximum utilize carbohydrate as a fuel if you're trying to upregulate your ability to use fat as a fuel and so this is like there's a saturation Point outside of that Spectrum most people who just say hey like I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things how do you know a couple things there's a lot of biological markers you can take um there's also just some some practical takes now none of these markers by themselves are any sign what you want to do is probably a couple of them and then say okay this is maybe a clue so again it's really important to emphasize not a single one of these tests that I'm about to walk you through automatically means you can't use fat as of fuel or the other case which is maybe you're poor at using carbohydrate as a fuel so disclaimers aside um we we'll get into a couple of them so should we think about these as informative and useful but not diagnostic exactly uh what we call this data inspired or data LED and not data driven great okay cool so number one you want to think about just overall functionality do you have a reasonable regulation of your energy throughout the day now many things could be going into this which is why these are not specific Diagnostics but um as a basic measure we talked about blood glucose levels um you know a lot of people will say again you want that to be something like between 80 and 90 um milligrams per deciliter is a blood glucose level and and you can go look at the the cut off points for what determines to be pre-diabetic and type two diabetic as Etc um what I can actually recommend um this is there's a little bit of science here actually that I'll walk you through but a lot of this is my personal preference um I generally want people to be at 85 or lower and that's because of a couple of things number one um there's actually some papers that showed any uh every single point increase above 85 increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by about 6% okay great so technically while maybe 90 or 95 or even up to 100 or you know in the quote unquote normative values that's one clue again it's not definitive by itself doesn't mean anything um you need to really pay attention to what increasing by 6% actually means but it's a data point where I'm looking at if I actually then see symptomology and we run you through maybe some questionnaires ask how you're feeling throughout the day and we see uncontrolled energy bout so you're a lot of energy then you get really really tired and swings okay another data point all right and we may patch a few of these things together that may give me some Clues um that being said again this a lot of this rhetoric is used to then scare people off of carbohydrates and that is I want to be as clear as possible that is not not truly um the only thing people should care about right it can be a thing it can also be unrelated there are reasons you could have blood glucose concentrations at this level or energy swings that are unrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at all all right so one test you can run in addition to that if you're going to get blood glucose measured you can look at some markers we talked about earlier which are as and ALT um we talked about um how you can kind of look at that a to alt ratio before you can actually do the inverse which is look at alt and a um the kind of normative value there you're going to look at is like 08 I actually like to see it lower than that uh and that alone is has been actually associated with blood glucose disregulation and so if you see multiple of these signs again we're looking for patterns and patterns and patterns in both in our case biomarkers symptomology and performance and now you're if if all three of those things are lining up you may have an issue so performance- wise a couple of little tests you can run um ideally you have some sort of standard workout you do and hopefully it's it's pretty objective so in other words like uh I run the same 15minute Loop every morning for my cardio okay great how long does it take you to run that Loop like you could pick whatever distance doesn't really matter um what's your heart rate during that thing and then what's your perceived exertion now you should be able to do that fasted with very little drop in performance okay if you can do that then that tells me you're fairly good at using fat as a fuel source if however the one day you go to do your standard workout and you feel awful fasting that may be another clue that perhaps you're not very good at dialing in um that system if your recovery afterwards uh in terms of heart rate recovery is very long it may be another clue that you have a poor utilization of fat as a fuel source the inverse can also be true so if I give you something in the neighborhood of like 50 or so grams of carbohydrate and 30 minutes later your face is falling off the table that's a good sign that you're in the opposite you're actually very very very poor utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel and the reason I bring that up is um that is equally a problem we send we we hear people a lot make comments um like man I have to stay away from carbs I crash really hard if I do them that has what that actually means is you're very poor at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel you're getting a your sensitivity is way off we should be able to have carbohydrate at a reasonable dosage 50 grams and not fall asleep 30 minutes later or or half to run to caffeine so um that is a sign in our opinion this is again now just my practical brain telling you is um that's a sign of of dysfunction um we we should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates through the day if we choose to if we want to for any reason um now of course if you were to throw 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate in your belly you're probably going to take a little bit of an energy hit after that but we should be able to have a reasonable dosage and not you know have to fall asleep afterwards what is one way that people can enhance their utilization of carbohydrates uh for exercise the reason I ask is I think I fall into that category y um I do consume some complex carbohydrates and fruit post resistance training MH and that tends to be when I'm hungriest for them but typically unless I'm I've just done some resistance training I keep most of my daytime meals relatively low carbohydrate and then in the evening I prefer slightly less protein and more carbohydrate because it has this effect of um sedating me a little bit yeah and I sleep well and I know this runs against what everyone was taught uh which is to not eat carbohydrates late in the day but I like it because then I tend to wake up in the morning with at least as far as I can tell my glycogen stores not necessarily topped off but but certainly filled y um and I'm able to train fasted in the morning and my favorite pre-workout is uh consists of water and caffeine and electrolytes and maybe some supplementation as well but um I love training fasted so there's actually a number of things um one little sneaky thing you threw in there is actually the use of caffeine so that's another sign if if you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training that's generally another sign you're not very good at using fuel so I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts generally I don't need it for any kind of cardiovascular training yeah and when I say that it doesn't mean it's bad it's just like another clue that's like okay you should be able to do this without having to have caffeine to execute it now using caffeine to get a better result is is sort of different as an ergogenic aid um we actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals at the end of the day a lot of the times for our athletes who are cutting weight or trying to reduce weight so it is a fantastic way to handle a lot of things and that idea that if you eat carbs late at night uh that'll increase fast like that all is so old and so well destroyed scientifically that that that's not a concern um either so much data showing in fact that there's so much data on like eating timing is is U generally poorly understood about when you can eat and what you can't eat eating in the morning um versus eating at night like a lot of what we've heard there is talking and maybe we just save that for sort of another day because we're going to get really far down there SP we can di into it but um yes I think our plan is to cover that in an episode on nutrition um okay which is in this series the uh the only thing that I would add to it is you when you hear about ingesting carbohydrate late at night I should just say that uh at least in my case I'm eating the majority of my carbohydrate unless I trained resistance trained early in the day in which case I I post resistance training um in the last meal of the day but for me that's not really late at night that last meal is somewhere between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. so it's three or so hours or something like that go sleep around 10 10:30 or so so it's not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta I'm that too but um but typically it's not so I think that um people will be very interested myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this but um yeah let's so how do you improve fat utilization how do you improve carbohydrate utilization let's Hammer both out really quickly um enhancing fat uh utilization is as simple as doing a little bit of work in a either pre fat ingested state so anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training you're going to bias towards that nutrient right which is almost what we were talking about earlier so if you want to guarantee you burn more fat eat more fat prior to a workout now you're not going to lose fat but what you're what you're effectively signaling is we have an overabundance of this fuel preferentially Target this F fuel now the downside is that may actually hinder your performance um that's typically only a concern for people at a very high level um fat is a slower fuel source so if you're relying more upon that your top end is going to come down a little bit and so you wouldn't want to use that strategy prior to race if it is a carbohydrate dependent race right and in fact we actually see long-term adaptations that would suggest that so the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism will downregulate and so you get worse at that so not not a great strategy there um carbohydrate would be the opposite right so if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise you're going to bias more towards that so a handful of things you can do if your total caloric intake is um simply managed that's going to take care of a lot of these problems a an appropriate eating strategy so the types of food the combinations of food um all those things are going to make your post carbohydrate ingestion Bonk a lot of those things can go away so there's a little bit of physiology that has to be um corrected for so it's a little bit in one hand you can go very deep here right so the real answer of how we would do this is if we see a scenario like that we're going to do a whole set of analyses we're going to go full Labs right probably extensive blood panel urine saliva stool even and we're going to figure out where is that glucose disregulation coming from so a lot of people think like oh it's a metabolism issue it might be it also might just be a flag that something else is happening in the body so we're going to actually work backwards a lot to try to figure out exactly why that's occurring it may be as simple as oh you're eating a lot of your carbohydrates without any fiber or protein and we know that that's important because those will actually blunt the GL the glycemic index like the rise in blood glucose so it could be a simple thing of just like oh your combination of food is doing it it's not the total amount um it may be something again more endogenous to the actual system uh it could be um a horid issue it could be a breathing issue there could be a number of things so the way to get better at it is to Simply train it and specificity is King here so if you want to get better at um managing your blood glucose throughout the day so that you're not feeling those things it could be a fuel issue but it could be a number of other things and it's just hard to go into all of them with within our time constraint um so the Practical tool that I would say here is if you want to get better at managing energy throughout the day make sure that number one your protein is stabilized making sure number two you're ingesting your food in the right combinations ideally with some Fiber and or some protein or both that alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems um then you need to train at high intensity you want to get better at using carbohydrates of fuel train at higher intensity and have carbohydrates right before the workout um we'll do that a lot if um uh if if we see folks who are I I kind of walked you through the test of identifying if you're not very good at using fat as a fuel the test for not being good at using carbohydrate is the fuel is both that eating test I talked about as well as performance if you're a very very very slow starter it's just like really hard to get going that generally indicates you might be in a situation when you're not very good at using carbohydrates as fuel so we're going to practice that we're going to have a pre carbohydrate pre-exercise carbohydrate meal and then we're going to do higher intensity stuff not to the point of making you sick and digestive issues all that stuff but we want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel faster if you want to get better at doing the opposite then you do that opposite stratter either again using fat prior to the workout knowing your Peak performance is going to go down a little bit but you're you're investing in adaptation right so it's not about that workout it's about what's going to happen six 8 10 weeks from now investment is where you want to think about it or you could bring in some fasted training and so I want to really make sure I clarify when we were talking about it earlier I'm not at all against fasted training it's not it works it's just isn't required for fat loss it isn't required for fat adaptation it is a great option though if you want um what I was hoping to do with that conversation and maybe I didn't articulate that well is to not restrict people but is to open you up and like you say you have a lot of options if you like to do fasted cardio amazing it is great if you hate it you don't have to you can reach the same performance goals the same physique goals without ever doing it if you love long duration steady state stuff it is great if you hate it there are other options higher intensity stuff again if we're just talking about fat loss so I hope now that that's a little clearer in terms of the same thing with nutrition if you like higher carb great if you like lower car these are all great you have options and you don't have to fret so much over oh my gosh I have to do this thing a certain way and I absolutely hate it you don't have to worry about it hit those Concepts and you'll be fine a few minutes ago you mentioned that if we ingest a given macronutrient fat then the body will preferentially use that fuel source you ingest carbohydrate we'll use that fuel source is it always the case that the body uses the ingested macronutrient prior to using glycogen I have to imagine it's using both I mean if I were to have some carbohydrate before um doing any kind of training the muscles still burn glycogen right or do they have some way to register the amount of circulating carbohydrate that would allow or available carbohydrate in the form of food stuffs uh that would allow ow them to not tap into their own muscle fiber stores of glycogen all right so the way that we derive energy for exercise or basic maintenance a little bit about cellular physiology so you've got a couple of organel and structures that we need to pay attention to the first one is the nucleus that's hold you DNA the second one is the mitochondria and then everything outside of that you've got all these other organel that do a bunch of things like ribosomes for protein synthesis etc etc all right now when you want to produce energy for exercise anytime you hear the word anerobic you automatically understand we are meaning without oxygen all right great that all happens in the cytoplasm the cytoplasm is that space that is not the mitochondria not the nucleus so it's the space in between everything else this is like jellylike substance that sounds there so anerobic metabolism happens there every single aerobic metabolic process happens in the mitoch all right why is that important if I go to create cellular energy and I need it the fastest possible I'm going to go for phosphor creatin because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm the stoch geometry is one to one there which means for every mole of phosph creatin I burn I can create one ATP it's one: one it is incredibly fast but it is very limited because think about it how much of that could I possibly store in the small size of the cell that's it if I need energy past that point now I'll start using muscle glycogen because that is also stored in the cytoplasm so it is right there the story geometry is not one to one it's a little bit higher probably like four to one so for every molecule of glycogen you burn you're going to get something like four is some small number of ATP out of that which is great but again you're running into a storage problem how much can I possibly store inside a muscle cell it is very very fast much more effective than phosphor but so there if I then want to metabolize any form of fat or if I want to complete the metabolization of carbohydrates I have to start transferring into the mitochondria now I start getting whole hosts of ATP if you were to fully run through this thing which I'll talk about in a second um called the TCA cycle or KB cycle you'll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35 kind of depending ATP per so the energetic output is much higher okay so here's exactly what happens and I'm going to walk you through this in the form of carbohydrate and then I'll come backwards and go through um fat so remember carbohydrate it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated so it is one to one so the actual um chemistry here it is C H2O one carbon 2 H1 glucose is a six carbon chain so the chemistry here is C 6 h126 six carbons six Waters very simple that's a carbohydrate all right so you can imagine if you're watching on the video here you you'll see my fingers go nuts I'll try to make sure I explain it to you all just listening in an easy fashion so you've got this chain of six carbons is in front of you and the very first step to metabolism is you snap that thing in half right so you break it into two separate three carbon chains all right now in doing that you got a little bit of energy because you broke that one Bond but not a tremendous amount this is called glycolysis so Lis being the split you know gly being you split glycogen up got a little bit of energy of that all right you form this three car carbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic acid okay there's differences there but don't don't kill me General audience friends all right I gotta gotta give this communicate this to everybody so you got a little bit of that now you can't do much past that besides rip one more carbon off of each of those three carbon chains so I've got two three carbon chains I got to be careful how I do this with my finger so I don't flip you off here in a second but I burn one more off of each I get a little bit of energy and now that little two carbon chain I have two two carbon chains those are called acety COA all right amazing I have now completed anerobic glycolysis I've got really nothing left I can do here I made a little bit of ATP now wait a minute I have now freed two carbons because remember I started with six and I splited them apart but I didn't I had two three carbon chains I burned one each I've got two free floating carbons I have to now do something with them my body will not let me go through that part that last process unless I've got a plan for that free Carbon because I can't break it in half amazing here's what's going to happen if I have those three carbon molecules and I don't have anywhere I can put that carbon you're not going to go through that process it's going to stop it you're going to start building up pyruvate now at the same time you're breaking ATP for fuel that's called ATP hydrolysis right you have water that comes in you have an adenosine and three phosphates that's why it's called ATP adenosine triphosphate 1 2 3 you break one of those phosphates off there you go there's your energy so now you have a free floating inorganic phosphate and an adenosine D phosphate so two over there amazing that actually results because you use water for it results in a free floating hydrogen ion okay just have to trust me hydrogen H2O any idea what a free floating hydrogen is um it's G to that's acid yeah say I was going to say it's going to increase acidity that's what acid for anyone that's ever measured pH what you're really measuring is the the the amount of hydrogen potential hydrogen that's what PH is Right 100% there's two definitions of pH but you get it that's one of the two so is this are you going to tell me this is related to the the the burn we're going to get close right so I've got a bunch of free floating um you got the phosphates which are actually problem too probably more of a problem Than People realize and that hydrogen what are you going to do with that hydrogen well one thing you can do is actually ship it over to pyruvate and bond it there we have a special name for that little molecule when you have pyruvate and you have hydrogen attached to it do you know what it's called Uh hydrogen peroxide lactate lactate lactic acid this is that whole system right again I'm skipping some steps making a little bit of mistakes here intentionally folks just to make this assumed so what happens when you start running a bunch of anerobic glycolysis you start seeing massive rises in lactate cool not lactic acid right right that's why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but the lactate is actually not causing the fatigue the lactate is actually sparing you from having a bunch of free floating mhm acid it's also can be then used directly back in the muscle because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen and you can take that hydrogen back off of it you've now turned it right back into pyu and you can run it through this whole cycle as fuel that I'm about to do you can actually actually ship it out of the exercising muscle and ship it into a non-exercising muscle and then go backwards and make glucose what actually liberates hydrogen from from from lactate you like chemically yeah so what what liberates uh what well what are the stimula that can take hydrogen off the pyate oh yeah and and then in other words to reduce lactate and free up that hydrogen oxygen availability so in fact one of the major places that you ship hydrogen to or one of the major places that you ship lactate to is your heart because it's it's what we call like the ultimate slouch fiber and it is has a ton of freely available mitochondria which have a ton of access to oxygen so it can actually then go to it form water the HDO can be used to form water and now we have a place to store the hydrogen got it right cool so as a result of anerobic glycolysis we have made a little bit of ATP we've created a lot of waste and we don't have anywhere to to go with these end products so when you do anything of a higher intensity and it says I need energy fast you're going to go to this system first right right past ATP because it is the fastest place to get energy but you're not going to get much of it and you got to deal with the waste products boom right back to the beginning of our conversation endurance is about two things energy production and waste management and we're right we fatigue buffering this is it right how well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen right drop in PH and how and then what are you going to do with these products if you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate you then have to take some do something with those pyruvates or those acdal coas what you're going to do if oxygen is available you will take those things and ship them into the mitochondria they have to go through some cell walls and some other things like that but they're going to get inside there once they're in there that two carbon acety COA runs through this entire cycle that we call the KB cycle that's this really interesting place that's where uh B6 and nmn people are like that's where that whole stuff starts to kick in all your B vitamins basically run that entire circle um and you're going to start off the top you have a bunch of fun stuff going on but as a part of that Circle you're going to pull off some some of the hydrogen ions you're going to send these to What's called the electron transport chain that's where you're going to get a ton of ATP out of and as a result about halfway through the turn you're going to pull off one carbon and about halfway through the other almost the other way through the Finish you're going to pull off the second carbon so you're going to take the second acet COA run that entire thing same through as well and so what we did is we started off a six carbon glucose chain we split it in half we called those pyruvate made a little bit of energy because we broke that one Bond of those two carbons that are in the middle cool those two three carbon molecules we pulled one carbon off of each we brought in sorry we moved those into the mitochondria we brought one off we took a breath brought in some oxygen bonded that bre took out two CO2 exhales we ran the Asal COA through the crb cycle one two carbons per turn coming out of CO2 so we had six carbons total when we started and we exited with zero carbons now we have fully metabolized a molecule of carbohydrate that required an Anor robic start and an aerobic finish if you don't have a lot of mitochondria large mitochondria and high functioning mitochondria you're going to limit your Anor robic performance because you're going to get you're going to run that door full very very quickly you can't go past it because hydrogen will build up way too fast and one of the things that we know is both temperature and pH run enzyme function so they're going to stop you won't even be able to run through in fact that ATP hydris phase even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP if I put enough acid in there it would stop working because the atpa enzyme needed to split won't be able to run in a highly acidic environment or a hot environment yeah at some point perhaps today perhaps in a future discussion but still not too far from now we could talk about the role of temperature uh in the in pyu from in terms of its regulation of muscle contraction but I want to make sure I understood something correctly you mention these these uh two parallel fuel systems right one is essentially anerobic right and the other is aerobic you said that if we can't pull enough um if we can't break enough bonds then we limit our Anor robic capacity correct I would have thought given that uh the mitochondria are the site for essentially for aerobic metabolism yeah that we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well um perhaps you could just clarify for me how these two things are divided or is there not a clean division is it not an either or No in fact again I think it's better to think of these things rather as two separate parallel things as one big cycle they're one gear turning the next being compromised in one will compromise the other that I should say reminds me of what you said earlier which is this the bicycle gear um analogy that works uh great so if you if you short circuit one basically the the chain can't move that's yeah fantastic okay so um so indeed they they are running in parallel but they are um interdependent yeah well they're actually not even running in parallel because they're actually funneling to the same end point right which is like if you're going to come from the Anor robic glycolysis route or you're going to come from the fat route which I'll talk about in a second they're both going to be limited in the mitochondria so when that thing's full it doesn't matter you can't run either system right so is more of like a again if you're running the bike gears it doesn't really matter if the back one's larger or smaller because if either one is limited you're toast because they're running on the same system you can you can you can sneak a little bit here and there but but not much you also really nicely highlighted how lactate this thing that we think of as a a limiting factor it's like the burn it gets in the way and it's the thing we need to stop and buffer and all all sorts of things sure it's actually really a fuel it's a it's a tremendously effective fuel yeah is a is a strongly preferred fuel actually the is interesting this is a very classic case of Association um correlation versus cation right so the the original actually like there's a really cool history on lactate but it was originally found uh I think in Germany um pardon my history there some somewhere in Europe and hunted Stags so one of the things is they sort of realized is like if we if we if we harvested a stag in a rest of State when it didn't know we were there versus if we chased it and it was ran down that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher in in the latter situation therefore lactate started immediately getting this association between High fatigue points and it is easy to measure if you to do any sort of lactate test any sort of metabolic test you will see as fatigue increases lactate will also increase the assumption that was then oh my gosh it's the cause now we know like again it's not the thing it's in large part trying to buffer the negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis and and some other things so it is certainly playing a part in that role but it is not a core driver it's also why you don't need to worry about doing things to quote unquote um reduce lactate in the muscle after exercise or to clear lactate or any of those things you may still want to do those activities but not for that reason lactate is fine you're actually going to use it in again the neighboring exercise muscle fibers in the same muscle another muscle you can send it actually to the um to the liver and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis and it can actually replenish liver glycogen just as that fuel source or you can send the harder any number of sources you can also just sort of put it in circulation put it back in the muscle and once enough oxygen is there you can just kick it right back into either glucose or glycogen it's totally fine so it is obviously clear though once that number gets very very high other things are going to be happening that are be causing a lot of hurt and this is your managing waste right is really an issue of managing what am I going to do with all this extra carbon what am I going to do with all this extra inorganic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts but that's the thing you have to deal with I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising for example if I do a very short bout of exercise y typically that's correlated with a higher intensity output I mean I suppose I could jog for one minute but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less which fuels are used is that mainly driven by fat stores by carbohydrate stores is it driven by dietary fat preferentially or carbohydrate that I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those or protein for that matter and then is we transition to exercise that goes a little bit longer you know anywhere from you know 3 to 5 minutes how do those ratios change and as we transition to longer duration what most people think of as endurance exercise but long duration output of you know 20 minutes or more leading all the way up to a full Marathon how does that change the ratio of fuel sources that are used and I'd be particularly interested in distinguishing between carbohydrate fat and protein that's ingested so coming from food sources or carbohydrate fat and protein that are coming from Storage sites within the body okay great let's start at zero seconds and run all the way through marathon and we'll we'll flag the distinctions where they start changing as soon as you want to create muscle contraction and power the very first source of energy is phosphor creatine that's going to power you for zero to maybe say 8 to 15 20 seconds of maximal exertion and that's in coming from the muscle fibers themselves yeah that is actually stored in the What's called the cytoplasm so this is a little area space in the muscle fiber um that's sort of like in this jelly-like substance and it's nice because one molecule of phosphor gives you one molecule of ATP so it's not a big energy output but it's very fast because it is stored right there in the local exercising muscle right now if you need energy past that point say you know 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes this is now you're going to have to transition because you're going to burn through that phosphocreatine it's going to be out you're going to have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism this is what we call anerobic glycolysis so there's two phases of glycolysis now glycolysis itself means glucose burning all right so just means we're using carbohydrate as a fuel source so initially when we start off this Cascade um which is going to take us again for a couple of minutes um carbohydrate utilization comes first from the exercising muscle so it's very similar to phosphocreatine that way if you start running low on it you can actually start pulling blood glucose and if blood glucose gets low you'll have to start getting glycogen from the liver to keep that up and we've sort of covered that conversation all right so a little bit of chemistry here just give me a little bit of of room here so now remember a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that has been hydrated so one carbon attached to one water and remember water is H2O most of the time when we're talking about glucose it is in a six carbon chain so six carbons attached to six water molecules all right great when I go to split this up through Anor robic glycolysis it works a little bit like this so you've got this six carbon chain the first step is to snap that thing in half you're going to make two three carbon chains now we broke one Bond right there so we got a little bit of energy but not a tremendous amount um at the end of anerobic glycolysis you're going to net something like three or four ATP so more than you get from the phosph triple or quadruple but still not very much there's another major downside that's coming in a second to this system the upside is it's fast now one actually one adaptation we get to training in this style is you'll increase your ability to store glycogen in your muscle which is great right we can actually biopsy you and measure the amount that you store and a training adaptation is awesome so you're able to sustain the system longer so perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training you hit a fatigue point and now you maybe can extend that to 100 or 115 seconds simply because you're storing more glycogen in the muscle before we have to in then go into the blood and get it and form of glucose so that's great so we've got this six carbon molecule and we split this in half we got that little bit of ATP and now we're in this little tricky position because this three carbon molecule is what we call pyruvate pyruvic acid and again chemistry folks I'm skipping some steps I'm going to intentionally make some mistakes here I'm making sure the entire world listening regardless of where they come in can can follow me here okay so don't burn me on the details right you've got this pyate the problem is you can no longer do anything with that glycolysis is over you've got to make a choice right in order to make something out of those three carbon molecules you've got to ship them to the mitochondria as we said that is the only place of aerobic metabolism right we cannot do aerobic metabolism anyway where else until we enter the mitochondria so anytime we cross that barrier we know we've automatically switched from anerobic to aerobic well here's the problem if you were to take one more carbon off that three carbon pyruvate you have to now do something with that carbon waste okay so before when we split the six carbon chain we didn't actually leave any carbons free floating we just split a two molecule in half when we go to split from pyruvate and make it into this two carbon molecule called acetel COA or seal COA now we've got a free Flo in carbon we have to have a strategy for that because that's going to increase acidity level any enzyme in our body that works to create fuel is very pH sensitive all right so if this thing if pH gets off either high or low these enzymes can't work and that's really really important because even if I were to give you a direct injection of ATP remember that's that energy currency that's the only way we can actually form energy um I guess remember to clarify anytime we're using phosphor or glucose or fat which we'll get to a second we're not actually getting energy for exercise by breaking those down we're getting energy that we can use to then make ATP we break that ATP down that's what's actually powering muscle contraction um you can go back to our previous episode where we walked you through the detail of the muscle contraction but that's what we're after okay so in the case of pyruvate if we split that off we have got to deal with that and the only way and the best way we can deal with that is oxygen remember we're going to breathe in O2 that O2 is going to combine with that free floating carbon make CO2 we're going to Exhale that thing out that's our Waste Management strategy but that has to happen in the mitochondria remember if we're using oxygen it has to be in the mitochondria so if we have the ability to ship pyruvate into the mitochondria we're golden but what happens if we don't why do we not well if we don't have enough mitochondria or our mitochondria are too small they're too far away or we don't have sufficient oxygen availability why don't we have sufficient oxygen availability because we created the pyate too fast and the demand in the mitochondria is exceeded by the buildup of pyate and so now we're having this giant backlog and this thing fills up fast we have a couple of strategies here well when you're going through ATP and you're splitting it's called HP hydrolysis in of doing that remember ATP is Denine molecule and then the T part is triphosphate 1 two three which means you have three phosphates attached at the end when you break that phosphate off that's where you get your energy so now you have an inorganic phosphate and an ADP Adent die phosphate two that process requires water it's called hydrolysis as a result of that you then have a free floating hydrogen and as you will know that is acid right that's potential hydrogen that's what that means and so you've increased the acidity in the muscle by breaking up all this ATP and so uh oh we're we're building up acid we have building up pyate we don't have nowhere to go with it and we can't cleave off a carbon because now we're just going to exacerbate the acid increase so what we can do is we can take those hydrogens that we're building up and store them on the pyruvate a pyruvate that's holding an extra acid has a special name and we call that like lactate right so that's why we see this buildup of lactate so one of the downsides of anerobic glycolysis is an incredibly High rate of waste production now lactate is not the cause of fatigue in fact if you think a little bit more carefully about what I just said it's actually stopping you it's what we call a acid buffer you can actually use it for a bunch of other things you can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber in the same muscle that's not working you can ship it to the Li you can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places and then you can actually just work backwards so if you ship it to for example the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free you can bring in the oxygen attach it to that hydrogen make water and now you're right back to pyruvate you put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose so you can actually store it in the liver um this is a process called gluconeogenesis um through this fancy thing called the Cory cycle which is what the the proper cycle here is so you can use it as a very potent fuel source in fact a lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source not only for exercise but for cognition and a bunch of other things so lactates in fact this is why um if you've seen any the research about pre uh exam testing exercise uh you'll see a noticeable increase in exam scores if you do a 20-minute about of exercise prior to taking the exam and it's largely in part probably because of things like elevations and lactate how intense of exercise uh would be most beneficial I don't know that exact answer I just know that uh generally any form of exercise is good but if you were to reach a a reasonably high heart rate you're probably going to see in fact there's an acute and chronic adaptation here so Folks at exercise have better memory memory retention score exams Etc but then also doing it prior to that exam make sure you recovered and rested back down the straight but you'll generally perform better previous guest on the huberman Lab podcast who's the who's a psychology professor and neuroscientist and also dean of College of Arts and Sciences at New York University NYU Wendy Suzuki is um religious about daily morning exercise yeah specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning in memory and has a lot of really beautiful data I consider one of the real Pioneers in this space um so if people want to learn more they can look to that episode or Wendy's work uh we can provide a link to a couple of the papers but this is fantastic in that it's incredibly clear I think for the first time I'm understanding what what lactate is really doing um and it's dispelling a lot of myths that I think I and a lot of other people arve to the discussion about lactate with what happens when the bout of exercise extends longer amazing so if we want to continue past that point we have to have some sort of strategy to get through it right we're stuck we're out of gas we have to then ship it to the mitochondria and now we're going to enter what's called aerobic glycolysis and this is going to take us anywhere from again say that 90 seconds of all that work up to really 20 30 minutes in fact it really will take us to unlimited um if you look at a highly competitive marathon runner even those that are running say your two-hour Marathon those folks are burning up to 80% carbohydrate it it is a it is not a fat burning thing and the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow it provides a lot of energy but it is incredibly slow if you're trying to run a 4 and a half or so minute mile repeated 26 times you have to be moving fast are they ingesting carbohydrate as a fuel source during the race unless you're on the team you don't know they won't really tell you these are sort of Trade Secrets um it would be I would say fairly rare to not have something right there's a bunch of different strategies if you're going to go really long like some of these um like cycling where the races will be several hours then you actually might go to some fat as fuel sources I I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones and things like that now but traditionally most endurance folks are going to bias heavily towards carbohydrate um now in one respect you're not going to run out of carbohydrates until you're many hours in these folks are are unique case but the average individual who who's doing an hour hour and a half cardio even you're not going to be limited by your carbohydrate stores you're going to be just fine you limited by some other things which we'll maybe sort of break down here in a second um but you're going to be fine there um a lot of those folks will take carbohydrate though at very specific intervals you want to you do want to be careful though of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates prior to your exercise spout um we have actually have this little thing that's called the insulin glucose double whammy and what that means is when you ingest carbohydrates immediately your blood glucose goes up and that's depending on the type of carbohydrate and things like that well the same thing happens with exercise and so what happens is insulin wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood at the same time muscle wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood and so we have this giant bolus of carbohydrate come in and then all of a sudden our blood sugar crashes and so if you're going to be doing so your your first half marathon or something like that and you're in those giant Corrals where there's like you know 100 people waiting to go and you're standing there for 45 minutes you may or may not want to slug down like three or four bananas in a bagel and and and honey and things like you probably don't need that now not everyone experiences this double whammy but it has been shown in the literature to happen to some people so you want to just be a little bit careful um an easy way to combat that is just practice exactly what you're going to do in your race in your training it's like the simplest advice ever but you'd be stunned how many people do things uh during the race that they've actually never done a training I suggest people do exactly what you described also for any kind of cognitive testing course before big exam is not the time to discover whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso or take a neut Tropic for the first time or uh or change anything I mean if if indeed the the score on that exam is is Meaningful to you you keep keep things regular so to to recap what we've done here is we started off in the cytoplasm with this glucose molecule that is six carbons we took that thing we split it in half we call that thing anerobic glycolysis we made a little bit of energy but not much we take those three carbon molecules we ship them into the mitochondria we take each one of those we clear off one carbon each those carbons we take a breath in we attach them to oxygen we exhale them get rid of that energy we are now fully into aerobic glycolysis each one of those two carbon molecules we run through the KB cycle each round of the KB cycle Burns one two carbons so we go one two one two and now we've gone from six carbon molecule all the way down to zero we used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that KB cycle run to go to the electron transport chain from there we made a whole bunch of ATP and so we have now fully metabolized one molecule of carbohydrate and the end product of all of it is simply ATP water and CO2 beautiful and leads me to the conclusion that most everything is really about utilization of carbons and exhaling CO2 is that how I should think about book ending what you just described this is why we started off the conversation with the circle of life this is really a carbon gain this is why we call uh chemistry with carbon organic chemistry right that's what the whole thing is about any living being has to run through metabolism it's all a carbon game any lming being has to use ATP this is all just a big fancy game of how do I make ATP and handle the waste remember endurance is all about Waste Management fatigue resistance the same thing and energy production we're playing a game here the whole game bring in energy use it mitigate waste products so when thinking about aerobic exercise or long duration exercise in this case anything longer than five minutes for that matter five minutes all the way up to an ultramarathon the breathing associated with endurance exercise the heartbeating which of course is associated with the breathing and vice versa it's really all about bringing oxygen into the system that then allows those carbons to be used and within the mitochondria specifically and then carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we work through the carbon of the sort of beads on a string is that right unless you're moving incredibly fast for a very long time and we're talking probably north of 90 minutes endurance is really not a game of making sure I have enough fuel it is simply managing the waste production and that's exactly what you described you need to bring in the oxygen so you can handle the carbon that's building up as a result of both the anerobic and aerobic glycolysis that's our game here if we start talking about endurance events longer than that now we do have to start worrying about running out of muscle glycogen running out of liver glycogen Etc or if we are at that 2hour Mark or so and we're moving very very very fast but anything south of that is just managing carbon buildup and we do that best through oxygen utilization or getting more efficient and having a higher capacity for our anerobic side so we can do that by having either more glycogen in our muscle so that lasts longer or building better acid buffering systems and there's a whole line of supplementation that are specifically acid buffers there's a whole line of training there's a whole line of breathing to manage this that so we have a lot of strategies where we can can maximize endurance all we have to do is go back to the earlier part of our talk which is figure out what's the actual limiting step and then train according to that or to your strategy your nutrition your supplementation that defeats that limiting factor for an example if you are trying to maximize your performance in this 20 second maximal burst and your strategy for that was to make sure your muscle glycogen is saturated it's probably not going to help a ton because you're not going to be limited by total fuel you're going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid however storing more glycogen in your muscle in preparation for a marathon is a tremendously effective strategy because that will become a limiting factor so what we can do actually next if you'd like is we can just walk through these and look at the individual limitations where the failure Point happens and that effectively will outline your strategy for improving them so you taught us about carbohydr utilization as a fuel source what about fat and what about protein great I'll start with protein because it's easy it is generally at best going to represent 10% of your energy output now that will grow over time in terms of if you did a several hour B of exercise uh when you started doing it you might be using 5% of your energy from protein and then that might grow to 10 or so and that happens because you start running low on muscle glycogen you start running low on liver glycogen you start then having to pull in energy from another place so like as those numbers go down you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat as well as protein having said that it's not a tremendous fuel source um it is only aerobic so it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when I say oxidized you use oxygen to burn something to to make a fuel um so it's not a significant contri to energy in that regard uh and unless you're talking ultramarathons are longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance and so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that um in terms of fat as a fuel source now here's the fundamental difference while carbohydrate starts anerobic and finishes aerobically in the mitochondria you're using mostly the carbohydrate in the exercising muscle tissue eventually you can pull from blood and then you can pull from the liver with fat you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle intramuscular triglycerides but the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat comes systemically and so now we have a fundamental difference we actually literally have a Time problem I can get energy from carbohydrates faster because it is directly there if I go to pull it from fat I've got to pull it from the rest of the body which is why somebody who loses fat loses it from their entire body despite the fact that they may be only exercising a couple of parts so think about a runner someone who lost a lot of fat running you don't see them just lose fat of their legs it comes from their face and their neck and everywhere why because what you're going to do is pull fat from the entire system you're going to break it down through a process called lipolysis which is means you break it down from the stored form um you put it in the blood as that glycerol backbone which is that three carbon Backbone in the individual fatty acids it's going to float through the blood there's a seven step system here but we'll skip it for now it's going to have to get then uptaken into the muscle in the muscle then it has to get taken up and run into the mitochondria now that backbone that three carbon glycerol backbone is actually going to function almost exactly like the three carbon pyu just get it into the mitochondria cleave off one carbon run it his AOA bada bing bada boom exact same thing super easy to metabolized small enough to go through the mitochondria membrane the fatty acid change become a problem so if you have a chain that's longer um than eight or so carbons it has to actually go through a special transporter on the cell wall to get in and that's going to be limited by a thing called carnitine and you're probably familiar with that as a supplement you may have talked about it there's a lot of places that make it um that's going to be a limiting factor if it is a smaller what we call a short chain or even a medium chain triglyceride which a lot of folks have heard of MCT that's what we're talking about that can actually go Direct directly through because it's small enough to pass through and you can use it immediately as an energy source in either case the way that you finally metabolize a fatty acid is a process where you would go through and cut off two carbons at a time why would you cut off two because you're trying to make that two carbon acetal COA so you can run through that KB cycle again because you're cutting off two carbons at a time we have a special name for that oxidation process it's called beta oxidation that's exactly why we call it beta oxidation two carbons in you cut it off to make that asot tooa so you can notice the oxidation pathway the electron transport pathway is identical whether you're talking about the carbohydrates or the fat in fact it doesn't even matter more to our point if we're talking about simply fat loss it really just is about running that electron transport chain whether it came from a carbohydrate original Source or a fat original source it ends up in the mitochondria as basically the exact same thing it then ends the end of metabolism as the same thing remember the final end point of carbohydrate metabolism is water ATP and CO2 do you want to guess the final end point of fat metabolism it's water ATP and CO2 so practical applications here if you want to maximize f loss what type of training is best it really doesn't matter if you enjoy longer steady state stuff fantastic if you enjoy intervals amazing if you would like to do a combination that's my personal preference that's great too you have a ton of options pick what you think is a combination of challenging not all exercise should be easy but you will actually enjoy somewhat or you're willing to accept and anything that you absolutely hate don't do it times is very very very difficult to do high-intensity training you have to really be interested in doing it if not it ends up turning into like moderate intensity training you sort of just check the box and it doesn't work that well if you're just checking the box so if you're like man mentally I don't have it in me today to get to a high heart rate and throw up and all that stuff cool but you can just do some moderate steady state stuff well that's a win great if you're like oh my gosh more than 10 straight minutes and I'm so bored and you're all maybe you're also like I don't have 45 minutes I got to get this done in 8 minutes great go do some high intensity intervals either option will be equally effective as you mentioned earlier exercise is useful for aesthetic changes functionality and for longevity but when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss I do have to ask this question I often hear from people that they prefer one type of exercise versus another for sake of fat loss because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry I'm wondering whether or not there's any relationship between the intensity or type of exercise and the uh hunger stimulus now I don't have this problem because basically everything makes me hungry um and yet I'm also okay fasting for part of the day yeah I'm one of those pseudo intermittent fasters talk about what I mean by that I just happen to eat between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. naturally I I'm not religious about it but um but I don't do it for any other reason except that that tends to be when I'm hungry and I exercise outside of that um in the morning typically in any case is there a way that people can determine what type of exercise might be better or worse for them based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting effects because I also hear that you know some people will go for a long run and then they are quote unquote not hungry for several hours afterwards does that have anything to do with which fuels are being utilized during different forms of exercise that's actually a really good question I don't know the the mechanisms that could explain that answer what I can tell you is you hear the same comment for physical activity in other words people say man if I do this type of training then I just am exhausted and I lay around the rest of the day so my total caloric expenditure is actually compromised as an aggregate because I'm down um the data would suggest in general that doesn't happen so most of the time we don't see a reduction in physical activity um with either high intensity or steady State training in fact you generally see uh equal if not increased what's called neat so it's the non-exercising part of your day um in addition to the basil metabolic rate so physical activity wise you don't send to be Pro now hunger is a little bit of a different thing the answer here is I don't think we have time to actually do justice on this so perhaps best to to not get into this one yeah why don't we punt this down the road to our discussion about nutrition specifically and and weave back to it so we'll earmark it for that um meanwhile it sounds like if one is thinking purely in terms of uh burning calories yep and getting the health benefits of exercise to create a caloric deficit to create fat loss it doesn't matter whether or not they burn those calories using a form of exercise that relies predominantly on carbohydrate fat or protein correct it's not that it doesn't matter it's that either one will work because when we say things like that it's it doesn't mean they're actually identical they're are some slight differences and maybe those differences are important for some people and not others I says either one is a viable strategy great what about protein as a fuel as an actual fuel so here let me give you an analogy imagine that you are you were with me a few weeks ago in southern Montana and we were out um in the wilderness for a week okay and it's cold out there and you needed to make a fire uh and if I said look you can pick any of these things there are some there's some wood over there we brought some newspaper and then we brought out a match and we need to create a fire we're going to use that fire to energy and heat up okay I said great the very first place you would probably start to make that fire is the match you like the match and any match hey it's going to light immediately but it's probably going to last five to 20 seconds I don't know before it burns out that's fosil creatine real fast real Burns out if you were smart you would take that match and then light the newspaper on fire right now if you were to burn a whole newspaper uh it is more energy then you get to the match but you still you know I don't know what's it going to take a few minutes some number of minutes before an entire Newser burns up five I don't know right depends on the which type of newspaper it is I guess right amazing that's carbohydrate right if you were really smart you would use that to then light a piece of wood on fire and a wood if you've been in the wilderness it could last hours days it's really quite unlimited your phosphor storage is very Li limited small glycogen is a lot higher because you can store it in muscle you can store it in other places so you have more but not a lot fat is unlimited the average person if you're around say 70 kilos up 170 pounds or so and you're moderately lean maybe 15% body fat nothing crazy you probably have enough stored fat to create enough energy to survive for more than 30 days right this would literally be if you ingested zero calories you have enough fuel in your stored fat to keep you alive for certainly 30 days you wouldn't feel good and all those things but energetically basically fat will never ever be your limiting factor to Performance so when we start talking about what limits my performance in these areas you can just wipe fat off the list it will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance you simply have way too much the only problem with f is it's just too slow I've got to mobilize it I've got to get it in the blood move it that whole thing too slow so if I want to go faster I will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we talked about earlier you'll never see a situation in which somebody is 100% burning fat as of fuel and no perent carbohydrate it's always going to be too slow highest you'll get maybe 70 so per. protein in this equation is none of that now you may notice how do you make paper but fibrous you combine with water that you it gets pressed it gets compressed yeah yeah it's made from wood how do you make a match it's made from wood what's carbohydrate a chain of carbon what's fat a chain of carbon these are similar molecules right they're meant to give you pros and cons it's very difficult to just light a log on fire without a lot of work you'd have to burn burn burn burn burn so these are complimentary systems that are really close to the same thing protein is none of those things protein is more like a piece of metal so if you were out in the woods with me and we were trying to make a fire and you're like hey look I found some old uh railroad over there let's throw that on there I would probably look at you like you're czy now technically can you melt metal sure but you're going to burn a lot of energy to try to get a little bit back out of the metal and now you've also cost yourself a very very valuable structure so protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism it's just an incredibly poor choice your body will do it again maybe 5 to 10% but you now you're burning a very valuable Supply in a situation in which you don't know where there's ever going to be anymore remember protein is fairly transient it's you're not very good at storing it you can store a ton of carbohydrate and an unlimited literally amount of fat so you just really need to disregard thinking about protein as a fuel source your body does not want to do it you're not good at it you can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from protein make glucose from it it's just very poor you're not going to get much out of the exchange and you've burned your supply of metal which is going to be very difficult um it's a very high commodity in the woods or the Wilderness to have something like metal for people that consume very low carbohydrate or zero carbohydrate diets are they pulling more energy from muscle so which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids into ready carbon chains yeah I mean in this particular case once you've reached um a certain level of adaptation you've just gotten extremely good at generating glucose from other Fashions right so you can bias heavily towards fat adaptation the downside is and we've seen this born in literature you're going to perform slower so if you don't care about maximizing performance especially over something where it is a maximal effort for a few minutes or something then maybe you're not concerned and and that's absolutely great ESP especially for people just don't exercise then hey gez very little concern here but if you're interested in your performance and you're wondering why you're just like slugging it down well what you've done is you've downregulated the ability literally the enzymes responsible for that entire Anor robic glycolysis portion they get downregulated which means there's not as much around anymore and so you get really bad and slow at using carbohydrates as a fuel source so it's a very poor strategy for people in an anerobic based sport or who like that type of activity again if you don't care no problem um if you don't exercise at all then you really have no problem there which is actually why a high fat low carbohydrate nutrition strategy for people who don't do much physical activity is probably like well it's very effective it it is a really good strategy for weight management for energy stabilization throughout the day and the research would very much support that in my observation I would agree I've tried low carbohydrate diets of severely limiting or completely eliminating carbohydrate and after about two or three days I feel pretty lousy but mostly because I want to train very intensely right in the gym in addition to doing longer runs I tend to do all of those things across the week yeah uh but I've also observed and in fact know several people that love the very low carbohydrate AKA keto ketogenic type diet they're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se um but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot lot of long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the I walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them manage to um control their weight very readily and like that diet for that reason U when we had Lane Norton on the podcast he um pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight you have to restrict something either time or um macronutrients Etc to arrive at that um sub caloric threshold um get below the the sub maintenance threshold I guess one of the things I want to point out is this should be received as again not a this is better or worse this is just you now have a ton of options so whatever personal preference other factors you get to craft this strategy of performance Aesthetics and health based on your personal preferences at this point I'd like to go back to our classic list of nine adaptations that exercise can induce the first four of course being being largely largely unrelated to today's conversation but that were covered in the episode that we did on strength speed and hypertrophy so just to remind people the nine adaptations are number one skill and technique two speed three power which is speed times Force four strength and five hypertrophy today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance followed by Anor robic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise so if we could start with muscular endurance this would be uh number six on the list of nine adaptations muscular endurance how do I build muscular endurance why should I build muscular endurance and just to remind me what fuel sources are pred dominating when I'm training for muscular endurance great so remember muscular endurance is something that's going to be generally in a local muscle it is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue and it tends to be something in the neighborhood of say five to maybe even up to 50 repetitions so this is the classic example we give here is how many push-ups can you do in a row most people are going to land somewhere in that range I just said how many sit-ups can you do in a minute how many pull-ups how long can you hang on a bar um as a dead hang things like that that's muscular endurance muscular endurance is not a mile run or a marathon or anything like that so how long can I stand without breaking posture this is muscular endurance a plank a walls sit great yes love all these things okay now the reason I took you on that big long metabolism journey is so I could help you understand exactly how to train this factor or any of these factors with a more comprehensive understanding what's happening meaning thinking back to the metabolism if I'm going to ask my triceps to do 50 push-ups in a row what's going to be my limiting factor am I going to run out of fat no chance am I going to run out of glycogen no chance that's way too few of repetitions you have a lot left there so what's going to be the thing that stops me from getting 51 repetitions either you're going to have too high of a pH rise so too much acid build up or you're going to have a problem clearing the waste so really this is two factors dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out of the muscle tissue and into circulation because you have plenty of ability to handle that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body it's just you can't handle it in that tiny spot now I picked the tricep for a very specific reason you're going to deal with more pain when you use a large muscle group like your quads or your glutes than you are with a small muscle group for example nobody ever threw up after arm day but a lot of people throw up after leg day why is that look at the total amount of waste that you're dumping into your system when you have quadrupled or 10x the muscle size small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged in that local area large ones will dump so much waste into the system that you'll want to avoid that as quickly as possible and that's one of the reasons why you throw up after Hard Exercise great so the reason I'm laughing because I don't think I've ever thrown up uh from a weight training session and so it's making me wonder if I've ever trained that hard I've received uh or obtain the progress that I've wanted to generally over time not every week every workout every month uh uh but certainly over the 30 plus years that I've been weight training I've achieved the the results I wanted I have however uh vomited after a long long run when I didn't hydrate well oh or if I drank too much water sure oh sure too much water yeah you'll you'll get that out quick right I just uh want to be clear because I think some people are getting the picture that if they're not vomiting at their after their leg workout that they're not training according to uh your standards Again by the way um Dr Andy Galpin runs experiments in his lab he recruiting subjects all the time uh also known as my graduate students that's right in any event sorry to interrupt uh but I felt it was a necessary interruption so muscular endurance there's plenty of fuel plenty of fuel you manage acid build up and you also need to get that fuel out of you that's going to be a capillarization issue so the way that we can think about this is capillaries surround your muscle and the whole point of them is so that blood can come into them they hit this capillarization that actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down and so you can exchange nutrients in and get waste products out and then we get things back in circulation so the more of those you have the better you are at dispersing any of these waste products build up whether it's CO2 or the acid so the adaptation you're looking for here is an increase in capillarization potentially a slight increase in mitochondria but the time is too fast right so we're going to be able to need to do these 50 repetitions in say under a minute or something like that so getting the mobilization into the mitochondria getting fuel that way too slow that's not really going to get our performance here so what are strategies to increase acid buffering ability and then capillarization so on the capillarization side you simply need to train at that ability so you go close to failure and practice that often that alone will increase increase blood flow to that local area which will get take you through your process of increas in capitalization easy peasy specificity there just to briefly interrupt I find it remarkable although not surprising giving how amazing in the human body is that simply by doing some movement repeat like a wallet or a uh or push-ups or dips for that matter repeatedly over and over and over until you reach that failure point Y or that quaking point in the case of a wall sit that provides a stimulus for more capillaries to be built into the system literally the the production or the um the trafficking of endothelial cells which make up the capillaries and basically little pipes feed the system withy and remove waste prodcts it's like Iration right imagine you had a giant field and you had two big pipes running down the outside well in fact if you want to make sure water gets evenly dispersed across the entire field you'll have a bunch of off-shooting little pipes and the more of those you have the more coverage you get do we know what the the specific signal is that says hey I failed at this we need more capillaries I actually don't know what that is I could I would speculate It's a combination of um acidity as well as carbon dioxide and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there but I actually don't know I'm guessing nobody knows for sure because we still don't know for instance what the exact signal is for hypertrophy it's kind of an amazing situation we know the requirements for getting the result we want yeah but we still don't know what the specific signal is um in any event what I'm hearing is building more capillaries is great for enhancing muscular endurance and the way to get more capillaries into those muscles is to train for muscular endurance by getting close to failure or to some point where you simply can't continue for whatever reason could you give us an example of what a reasonable training protocol might be in terms of um the classic Galpin list now of exercise Choice maybe a few um options order volume and frequency great what should we be doing how often should we be doing it and you know for instance I do walls sits to failure then push-ups to failure uh given that this is a local process I'm guessing that if I do push-ups to failure I'm not going to increase the number of capillaries in my legs very much correct so you nailed it exercise choice is high Precision here so pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing and movement pattern you want High Precision this is the thing if you want to get better at a plank hold a plank if you want to do more push-ups do more push-ups you can do some other stuff that's complimentary but really this is a high Precision game do the exact same thing for exercise Choice very simple there okay in terms of exercise order I suppose this dovetails with volume yeah can I combine um training let's say wall sets for my quads and you know nearby muscle groups and then do push-ups to failure uh and then also do some sort of um pulling exercise to failure yeah absolutely again pick the exercises you want the movement patterns you want to do and do them the order Almost Doesn't Matter with the one caveat with larger muscle groups particularly again multiple leg activities that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue and so if you I guess theoretically wanted to maximize your push-up number and you did a whole bunch of say split squats um and you just did those and and you you you know did lunges for a mile or something like that you might actually slightly compromise you might not but you might slightly compromise your ability to do as many pull-ups in a row or hold a bent over row or something like that so if you really cared about that level um then you maybe want to do the one that's most important first in general my recommendation though is to do the bigger muscle group first how many sets and how often should one perform training for muscular endurance and when now the lovely part here is we've moved down the Spectrum past hypertrophy you don't need a lot of load here in fact the load only needs to be at or slightly above what you want to move move so if you want to get better at moving 50% of your one rep max you don't really need to train much more than 50 maybe 55 or 60% of your one or Max because if you go higher than that the repetition Count's going to fall and you're no longer going to be training muscare endurance so you just need to stay right around that number that you want to work on so again if the target is doing more pull-ups and assuming that you have the strength to do it and you check that box you simply need to practice the repetition range that you want to be in that's all it takes you can repeat that a number of times but because remember the volume is fairly low the load is very very low you can actually repeat these quite frequently so you won't get extremely sore for muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining because the load is very very light so you can do these more frequently if you would like more frequently such as you could do it three or four times a week easy if you would like you don't NE need to 3 days a week per a muscle group is probably fine here um if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be fine so if you wanted to do two days a week and you say wanted to do let's say you could do 25 push-ups and the goal is to get to 30 push-ups just as an example you might say okay I'm going to do sets of 17 and I'm going to do three sets of that I'm going to do that three days a week that's going to build up quite a bit or you could say look I'm going to do a set basically to failure I'm going to recover and do one or two sets that say 80% and I'll do that twice a week that's going to push the pace pretty well you're going to have a lot of uh gains from that and again this is not about hypertrophy this is about muscular endurance correct so I do want to emphasize and again please correct me if I'm um talking out of line here do want to emphasize that because we mentioned pull-ups you know if you can't get 25 five pull-ups then and you're doing 10 you're training for hypertrophy you're not training for muscular endurance per remember there's a big cross over here so anytime we're talking past like 15 reps we're technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance got it so here's a common mistake I don't want to get bulky so I'm I'm going to go lighter and do more reps and then people grow and then you landed still right in the middle of hypert Trea range right so like for people are like oh my gosh like every time I lift weights I I go lighter I do more reps and I you're still right in the hypertrophy Zone they'd actually be much better off training very very heavy in the one to three rep range they'd get really strong and they wouldn't grow much exactly MH so tell me if this is a reasonable protocol for what I'm going to call the typical person in my mind the typical person is somebody who hopefully is doing resistance training hitting that 10 sets per muscle group per week minimum yep to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy but is also doing some long duration training that we'll talk about in a little bit maybe throwing in a high-intensity workout here or there some Sprints maybe some ply metrics some skill-based training doing a bunch of different things to be all what I would call allaround fit yeah they're not training for any specific event or trying to maximize any one of the nine adaptations to the exclusion of the others that person decide okay after um they do this their longer run they're going to do a Max time a plank to Max duration they're going to do a wallet to Max duration and they're do push-ups to Max duration and then also do that same workout before they do their high-intensity interval training some other point during the week and then maybe even do it uh again um on their a so-called rest day just a real quick five minutes of and in doing so build more capillaries into relevant muscle groups and build their muscular endurance yep without eating into their overall recovery too much too much yeah so again the nice part about this is they don't Hammer you too much you're not going to get tremendously sore if you keep the load light the only switch I'd make there is I would probably do them after your interval rather than before so you can make sure you keep quality there uh and you're not compromised by a local muscular endurance when you're actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue with something like a higher intensity uh interval training so that would work fantastic the only other variable we have in hit on here is progression and this is very simple try to add a rep or two per week that's really all you have to go after so if you're up to 22 this week try to hit 23 next week or for wall sits and planks that would mean add add time time yep and if and if you run into a wall there just like the same Concepts we talked about with strength or hypertrophy back it down to more like in the 80 or 85% range and accumulate a lot more practice that's going to help help a lot with capitalization as well as acid buffering so you're going to continue to give yourself signals for upregulation um of the processes needed for that and it's not always pushing you to the end failure just like we don't want to always go to failure with strength we don't want to always go to failure with high intensity rules either same thing would be happening here what about Anor robic capacity how should people train for Anor robic capacity what exactly are they training for meaning what is the structural or seller adaptation or adaptations that are occurring that allow for increases in Anor robic capacity and why are increases in anerobic capacity good for us even if we're a quote unquote endurance athlete or we are a recreational exerciser who is not interested in building more muscle speed or things that I typically associate with Anor robic capacity yeah so this is really really fun remember Anor robic capacity is the total amount of work you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes and this is extremely high levels of fatigue the highest you're really going to see and by fatigue here I mean acid build up byproducts not fatigue as in like mentally I don't want to do this anymore so if we just think about the energetics for a second I'm going to do say uh let's take a really easy example of people have done that thing where you uh you don't go to the track and you sprint the straightaways and you walk the corners yeah remember that sort of thing yeah uh tatas 30 on 30 off things like this like this is what we're talking about um in this kind of anerobic capacity area now here's what's going to happen is fat going to be your limiting no we already made that clear right what about carbohydrates well if it's a single bout or a two or three bouts probably not but if you're doing this for a long time say you're going to go 30 on 30 off for 20 rounds you may actually start reaching a point of running out of M muscle glycogen in any of those cases though you're going to be running into an acid problem if you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions in addition to running low on muscle glycogen you're also going to start running into oxygen transportation problems because you're building up a lot of byproducts you got to continue you will actually cruise into aerobic glycolysis this is exactly why uh the community that I have worked a lot with um professional fighters very high level boxers world champions UFC fighters it is a five minute round that you're going to do five times this is for world championship fights you get one minute break in between so imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes getting a one minute break and doing that five times even though the individual bouts are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic you have to have both capacities you got to get really high anerobic you also have to have a lot of aerobic going on you have you're going to start running into limitations because of heart rate stroke volume and then even potentially ventilation the need for oxygen to be able to come in and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system becomes a problem because not only are you having so much buildup for such a long time you're also using multiple muscle groups so now this is a very important distinction muscular endurance tends to be localized now this is not right if you're doing these intervals you're on an assault bike you're sprinting up a hill you're grappling with somebody you have a lot of muscles being involved which means all of that waste is being dumped into the central part you have to clear it and I'm by clear it I now mean not out of the muscle I mean out of the body so your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen is going to be a major limitation to your ability to handle this stuff so what do you do well specificity wins practice the exact thing you're talking about so if you want to get better at sprinting the straightaways and walking the corners do that you can't always do it though you're going to run into limitations so this is when backing off to a lower intensity is going to give you a lot of benefits we know very clearly if you want to improve cardiovascular fitness high intensity moderate intensity and low intensity you're effective and you actually probably want to do a little bit of all of them this is why none of our Fighters would ever just do high-intensity training there's going to be some moderate um we tend to call this like cardiac output training um you can think of this as like any anywhere between zone two to zone four if you like zones I don't use them personally so I'm just going to intentionally interrupt you because this issue of zones has come up a few times and I want to make sure everybody's on the same page you also mentioned that you don't necessarily favor the Zone nomenclature but for those not familiar Zone one 2 3 4 all the way up to five is a kind of U back of the envelope uh type verbage some people and is more PR precisely followed by for other people meaning for me uh Zone one is simply walking uh easy walking zone two would be for anybody the pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform while still maintaining a conversation but just barely meaning if you were to push any harder then it would be difficult to hold that conversation then you'd be in zone three and then Zone 3 four five as I understand them are a little bit vague U but maybe you could give us a sense of the breathing patterns associate with each of the zones so that people could um map to those uh when we discuss Zone one through five uh and as I say all this I certainly um tip my hat to all of those people out there who like to measure percent of maximum heart rate um they like to use heart rate monitors um they're using any number of different devices I sometimes use those devices but in general I tend not to and I use my breathing as a Rough Guide of which zone I'm in so before we go back to specific protocols for Anor robic capacity tell me how you think about Zone one through five and how people might be able to assess whether or not they are in zone one two three or four or five great so zone five is that absolute top thing and we can flag ourselves there I liked how you flagged one and two the distinction between three four and five I'm I'm less concerned with either uh we will do some heart rate stuff but not to identify what zone we're in um the fact is the distinction between those zones is basically just made up right not that it's fake but there's no like rationale there it's a little bit like perceived effort in weightlifting you know how are you at 100% output or 70% you know when you're at zero and you know when you're at 100 in that moment but the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody's guess totally so we use or the relevance right so why does it matter if I'm at 60 or 70 is there actual difference there's not right so it doesn't really matter in that regard um if you're a very highly trained particularly cyclist things like that then and you can control a lot of circumstances those things start to make a lot more sense um but when you're in an open environment like the athletes I deal with it's just not going to it's not going to matter that much so um the way that I approach this is and I will use this word intentionally stolen directly from Brian McKenzie and his company shift adapt um they use what's called a gear system and I absolutely love it it's what we've been using for a long time so with Brian with your permission I'm gonna take it right now thank you Brian you gave me the permission thank you Brian Brian's a good friend of of of ours and I do think the the breathing gear system is a terrific way to think about the zones and to get a good sense of what zone one happens to be in yeah great so um the first gear is your ability to Simply breathe in and out through your nose at a set Cadence so basically regardless of how hard you're working can you restrict your breathing to like a 2 to 3 second inhale and then a two to 3 second exhale and this is really clever actually because a lot of folks will jump immediately into an over breathing strategy which mean you'll be ventilating more than you need which actually sends that reer up higher than it needs to be which kicks you higher into carbohydrate utilization if you're supposed to be in quote unquote Zone one you you're trying to be efficient not fast so using more carbohydrates than you need is not beneficial here um you're walking for the day you're out on a longer hike you're you're enjoying the day you shouldn't be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism it should be efficient a and so this would be getting into an argument with somebody while on a long walk you feel exhausted afterwards you over breathing yeah totally right okay yeah so you should be able to breathe at at a specific Cadence and generally people are um doing that more frequently than than they need right zone two uh rather Gear 2 is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you need to be but still nasal only so it is a force right whatever you need to do but your mouth has closed the entire time you shifted higher up you're burning more and more carbohydrate as a fuel source but you're still able to control that and restrictor through nasal breathing now gear three and four which is are final ones there's no gear five gear uh three and four is like a subtle Extinction I actually don't even care about the difference there I basically use gear one two and then S4 but you're basically talking about either a nose to mouth strategy or a straight up mouth mouth right so breathing in through the nose out through the mouth if you can control it that way you can do the opposite actually right can you breathe in and out through your nose but the classic one people do is in through the nose out there the mouth um again I really don't even care about distinction I basically jump from two to four a Brian may do it differently I don't actually know um four is just mouthmouth right and this is the case in most sporting applications you're going to be breathing because the nose is restricted right there's only so much space and as we talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 exhalation if you're restricting that this is going to be problematic so in your actual competition please go to the mouth if you need to right we practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible um but that's going to eventually happen when you're doing your high-intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can you're GNA have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute Freakazoid and you can stay in your nose but that's not going to happen right most people can't get past say 70 or 80% while breathing through your nose um I know some people can get higher but that's the general distinction so we pay much more attention to those particular gears than we do heart rate zones and zone five would be just pure mouth breathing all out running for your life system is just one to four there's no fifth gear got it so the gear four would again be mouthmouth breathing as much in as you can breathing as much as you can out got it and I I appreciate your description of of the gear system and how it um roughly relates to the zones we've been talking about I also um am reminded if anyone wants to experience the relationship between breathing and the offloading of carbon dioxide and your ability to exert effort in anything uh a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play when we walk or Jog and talk is he'll say let's just hold our breath now until we hit that piling or that um uh lifeguard stand on the beach and within seconds you actually can start to panic it also becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little while again be really careful with this but but it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide because you're probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensities You're simply building up carbon dioxide and that gas reflex is screaming to go off and you're actively suppressing it yeah so the interesting test here is your CO2 tolerance um on Brian's website you can go directly there you can there's a video to how to run this test and then you can put in your numbers and it'll tell you sort of exactly what to do as a result of it but the CO2 tolerance test is a test of exactly what you just mentioned so you should be fairly tolerant in other words non-reactive you can be responsive but non-reactive to elevations in CO2 so you should see them and feel them but you should be choosing how you respond rather than an reaction um there are interesting data looking at things like out of the blue panic attacks you can actually notice those in blood via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes prior to the event app happening so there are signals happening in your body um that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to the more in tune you can get with that the better your life is going to be um and even if we're specifically just talking about exercise performance so it's okay for CO2 to rise it's going to rise it's a byproduct of Anor robic anerobic metabolism it's a byproduct of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've established it's going to get there you're going to feel that however if you immediately go into a panic because of a small increase in CO2 this is a problem so returning to Anor robic capacity this morning we were training not together I couldn't keep up with your workout but I uh but in the the same uh General space and I did my once a week maximum heart rate uh one minute Sprint on the assault bike sometimes I'll do more minutes uh meaning I will do a one minute then take some rest and do another minute after some rest but I decided to do that one minute with you there so I could learn from you and indeed um I have to assume that that was largely within the Anor robic capacity um realm the first 30 seconds or so were manageable we gain more and more pain mhm there was a quit signal going off in my head you said there's real magic that occurs around second 40 and indeed somewhere around 240 for whatever reason it seemed easier but at the one minute Mark I was happy to stop because I was really at at least what felt to me uh 100% output yeah is that a good protocol for building up Anor robic capacity keeping in mind what you said before which is that specificity or precision as you phrased it um is important that is if I want to train uh interrup capacity for Sprint I probably should have been sprinting cycling I was I was on the assault bike um and so on how many of those one minute allout Sprints or 30 second allout sprints on the on the bike could and should one perform per workout and per week so marching through exercise Choice yep let's do it um order volume frequency and progression yep choice of exercises train for what you want to improve is that right not necessarily so in this particular case if you have a specific goal yes of course Do It um exercise Choice a couple of things you want to look for you want to pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here because you're going to go into our pain cave cave so if you're not comfortable running don't go run here uh you're never going to get to the spot we need to get to it um if you're not comfortable if every time you you go on a rower your low back hurts the next day don't do it if you're not comfortable using kettle bell swing you get the point don't do an exercise you're not comfortable with you also secondarily want to be careful cautious of heavy Ecentric loads because you're going to be doing a lot of repetitions at a high intensity so this is where I love an assault bike this is why a rower is great swimming is amazing running uphill generally more favorable than running on um normal ground especially if you're not Runner don't run downhill that's a lot of Ecentric load um I don't love things like box jumps here right because again a lot of Ecentric loading if suppose you can jump up land on the box step down but now you're you're again you're too many things are going through your mind I don't want to slip and fall I don't want to smash my shin on the box what happens if I too many variables pick something that is safer where you can really focus on your breathing and your posture and the performance all right so that's exercise Choice and then within that if there's some specific thing you want to get better at go ahead do it okay how many different movements meaning should I do the assault bike and then uh some form of safe executable uh overhead pressing um it's a little hard it's a little harder to imagine um Anor robic capacity for the upper body unless you have access to a skier or one of these um what are those things called the climber machines yeah the Versa climber the Versa climber that's the one the Versa climber um you can tell how often I do that one uh it's a great great piece of excise equipment yeah so how many how many how many exercises and in what order is it going to be two or three exercises since you're involving a lot of muscle groups typically that's a really distinction generally these are going to be total body movements so you can do something like a ski if you want to really isolate your upper body great love that you can do lower body isolation like cycling right where your upper body's not involved you can use weights here um you can do some barbell movements and and stuff like that they're just not my favorite choice is for most people too many complexity things going on so uh I generally I'm going to pick total body movements uh pushing a sled dragging a sled sprinting up hill swimming these things like that are are going to be good I'm seeing now why the assault bike is such a powerful tool because you're using your arms with some degree of resistance but not a lot of Ecentric load plus legs some resistance not a lot of Ecentric load and yet one can go quote unquote all out for 30 to 60 seconds yep and and the consequence es of a technical breakdown are minimal it's more like you're going to actually have a worse performance rather than an injury rate so there just a wonderful invention uh because of that where other things the consequences like say if you're going to be doing a barbell or kettle bell activity the consequences of making a technal mistake you might actually get an acute injury right there so they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale how many sets are sometimes referred to as repeats so how many 30 to 60c all allout sprints again doesn't have to be running sprinting but allout effort would be the better way to phrase it should I perform let's say per week right and then decide whether or not we can divide those up across multiple workouts or whether or not it's better to do them in the same workout yeah if you're staying with the same exercise for all of your workouts that's a little bit different answer than if you're if you're modifying them so say you're going to do this three times a week and you're going to do an airbike one day you're going to do some Hill Sprints another day and then you're going to do some swimming another day for sake of example I'm going to say um same movement because I think most people are going to be most comfortable with one or two types of movements unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete I think most people can probably find a hill that they could run up yeah and uh an airdine or salt bike a rower things of that sort yep you're going to have a pro and a con here so the pro of doing less sets is you can actually train much closer to truly 100% the downside is volume's low okay so a major mistake people make here is they'll do something like um I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off and I'll do that for 40 rounds you're not really actually going that hard in those 20 seconds so a key in fact if you look at the literature and all the B and all the positive benefits of high-intensity anal training that assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100% if you're sliding down into like again moderate training stuff you start to actually be in a spot where you're not getting the total high-end stuff but you're not doing it long enough to get the low-end stuff either and so you end up in this like you burn some calories you probably still enhanced mitochondria biogenesis and a little bit of capitalization but you didn't really justify only doing three rounds that's where the problem comes in so in terms of a couple of protocols I'll give you how many sets per week it's it's really hard to give a number unlike the strength tring stuff where it was easy to kind of land some stuff on um a typical thing you'll see is like a minimum do tends to be something like four rounds per day three times per week wow that's a lot so my once a week allout effort of sprinting on the assault bike the so-called airdine bike for 60 seconds one to three rounds of that might be doing something useful for for me but I should probably be doing that two or three times a week if you're going to get to a max heart rate I generally like to say give me a minimum of one day a week two's better days per week how many rounds whatever it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate right so in your case you did one minute okay good if you're going to extend past a minute or two one round might be enough so for example uh if you want to dis do something where I'm going to run a mile as fast as I can that's all need to do for the day you don't need to do multiple you can do mile repeats if you'd like but that is really really challenging I know we've extended the time duration here but I wanted to go there to show you the time domain matters here if you're doing something like a 20 second burst you're going to need more rounds if you're doing something longer like multiple minutes you don't need as many rounds to get there so um in addition if you're really reaching past this um 90 seconds of of hell when it's just going to do a lot more damage to the system not damage is in bad but is in there a lot to recover here so we need more recovery time from that a 20 second burst doesn't really challenge you it challenges in that 20 second ship but you'll be recovered and fine a thre minute thing is going to hurt and it's going to hurt for many many many minutes after that and you're going to still see maybe some performance decrements the next day depending on what your recovery stuff looks like so um a couple of things to playay play with would be something like this if you want to try like a classic 30 seconds on 30 seconds off protocol the literature will show like a minimum of four rounds of that probably three days a week so 30 seconds all out 30 seconds rest is one round repeat that four times at least once a week at least two would be better great right if you want to go something a lot longer than that you might be able to get away with one um but generally two days a week of this is better if you start actually pushing past like 3 to four days a week up to 5 or six you may actually be causing some problems um there's just a little bit of excess fatigue that's going to happen there that you you maybe want to stay away from in fact you can see a lot of endocrinological problems and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in um and we'll talk about more of those things this later but um that's a number to get with if you want to try something more like a 20 second burst I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest so you you can actually do a higher rest than work ratio most people tend to think of this as doing like one to one 20 seconds on 20 seconds off or lower I love doing like 20 seconds on 40 seconds off the quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high and it's also possible to now get like six to eight rounds so as I'm hearing this I'm going to wager a uh an offer uh to you and if you say Okay um than to to those listening based on what you're telling me about the relationship between intensity and quality and the need for sufficient duration of this Anor robic work yeah how is five to six minutes per week of all out work that's pretty good so what that means for me is I would do three allout one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or two M maybe more and I would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six minute per week threshold yep actually I think one of the U Marty gabala is a scientist um Canadian uh guy who amazing work who's done a lot of the the research on high-intensity interval stuff right and I think the number he actually threw out there in some of his original resarch was comparing six total minutes of work to upwards of like 180 minutes of work throughout um the the entire week and then one of the classic studies was looking at V2 Max improvements and he saw equal if not greater improvements in V2 Max with that so I think actually the name of his book might be like the six minute workout or something and so you like may have nailed that directly on the head purely by lock but actually by Also may be wrong at that number so we should probably fact check that will and also by inference from what you were saying you know if you're going to do this 20 seconds on 40 seconds off and you're doing more rounds or one minute all out so the way I'm going to think about this if it's okay with you is for five to six minutes a week I am sprinting yeah for my life correct but I'm sprinting for my life with good form in whatever movement I happen to be doing and I can do all of that in one workout but I'm separating out bouts of 20 seconds all the way up to one minute yep by the necessary rest in order to recover my breathing get back to Pure nasal breathing maybe Zone one zone two totally totally and then hit it again if you're gonna do the one minute thing like you do I actually generally encourage 1 to 3 minutes of rest before you do the next round and probably up to four to six rounds that would be your six minute number there now the caveat there is we don't worry about heart rate recovery we worry about exactly what you mentioned which is nasal only recovery once you can get back to that give yourself another 30 seconds or so and then you're ready to go for round two this is where it gets fun because I could imagine challenging myself to get on the assault bike for one minute of kind of warm-up very low intensity each morning and Sprint for a minute and then head off into my daily routine no okay that if you're going to do that though you need to give me three minutes of nasal only breathing before you go back to work we need to down do that and there are people in my life that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing because it'll have me speaking less so no problem chances are I'm going to use the um two or three workouts per week of a one minute all out maybe I'll try the shorter protocol can I give you one fun protocol called a try here please so if you have a you can use this on any equipment um but I learned this from another mutual friend Kenny Kane this is a great little it's a little test a little a little game you can play with yourself and the only way to play this game is you're going to lose which is really really lovely so you can do this at any dur you can do this for any duration of time but two minutes is a good number okay so you have to do this in somewhere where you can know distance so this could be running um the the air bike is what I use the first two minutes you're going to cover as much distance as you can possibly cover in 2 minutes and you're going to note that so let's say you covered 400 m right okay great you're going to rest for two minutes amazing that next round you're now going to go for distance so you're going to cover the exact same amount of distance you covered in round one which in this example was 400 met and it doesn't matter how long it takes you it may take you 2 minutes and 5 Seconds 2 minutes and 10 seconds because you're a little bit fatigued from round one round three you're going to now come back and do that exact same time domain that you did on round two so if it took you two minutes and 5 Seconds in round two now round three is going to last 2 minutes and 5 Seconds and you want to see if you can cover a greater distance 405 M 410 M then you did in round one and the beauty of this little protocol six minutes total of work right but if you slack in one of the rounds you just make the next round harder is there any rest between rounds yeah two minutes always two minutes rest you don't have to but this would be my recommendation Kenny K came up with this yeah I don't know if he came up with it he taught me thing well we both know Kenny and he's an incredibly nice and Incredibly skilled trainer um I'm going to call it the sugar cane yeah it's so great because it sounds really painful and if you go out too hard round one you're in such big trouble round two but if you go too easy in round one you're going to get absolutely obliterated in round three so it's it's like a wonderful thing and you can pick that number as a standardization and then just try to improve that a little bit per week so progression is the last part of this whole thing that we haven't gotten to yet before we move on um and the way you want to progress all of these things is you can time stamp again how much work you can do and then just try to do a slightly higher amount of work 5% or so every week or you can add a round which is a really nice way so um uh in the in the research um studies that have been done they're going to do things like week one you'll do three rounds week two you'll do four rounds week three you'll go five rounds you like add a round until you get up to say six or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol so that's a really nice way to go about it or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done in that same amount of time meaning go more intensely correct yeah you know get further distance than your 30 seconds or your 45 seconds or whatever um I want to encourage people to go as low as 20 seconds that's going to allow you to go very very very fast that's going to actually challenge that phosphor piece of little bit I want to encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds so the honest way the way that I will do it not that it's about me but just as an example of something you could do I do something in the 15 to 20 second burst range and I will generally hedge towards a 2: one rest to work ratio so I'm probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds that's sure that's to make sure that 20 second burst is extremely high quality cool I'm also going to do something in the 30 to 50 second range okay I might go one: one work rest ratio the quality of those 30 seconds is going to come down but the acid buffering is going to be extraordinarily challenged I'll also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range so again 30 seconds on maybe 2 minutes off now I won't be able to be I won't be working on my ability to handle um the waste product build up there but I'll be working on my ability to produce more force over that time which is another skill set and then all the way up to say what you do a minute 70 seconds and you can go one to one there or up to 3 to one um you're going to be working on a little bit of his different thing but that's exactly how he hit both sides of this this equation working on dealing with waste as well as actually working on bringing in nutrients and getting that system a little bit more effective so um you could set that up across your week and just it could be something like day one is that 22nd burst window day two is that maybe 60-sec window and then day three is maybe one allout effort and we're done there let's talk about the specific protocols and adaptations related to maximum aerobic out put or maximum aerobic capacity as it's sometimes called sure now we're moving past like that couple of minute range into like the you know five to 15 minute range but at a maximum intensity so what's the highest you can go from there we're not talking about our last category of long duration here well the beautiful part is we've already explained a lot of it because it's very similar to what we just talked about with anerobic capacity uh it is primarily going to be a problem of dealing with waste products especially at the end it's not enough total distance to be running out of muscle glycogen though it may start to creep down a little bit Fat's not going to be an issue but certainly more oxygen transportation is going to be an issue so we're just hedging a little bit more towards that side of the equation towards the end of that workout no doubt about it clearing out waste products is going to be a huge issue but really oxygen demand and delivery is starting to take more of a prominent role because we have had more time to clear waste and if we're not good at that we're going to be failing earlier than we need so the training for that needs to be a little bit at that exact same so a classic thing here is a one mile test right this is going to last for most people somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes you're sort of right in this window um if you just want to practice that once a week we're done here right exercise Choice same thing we talked about right pick an exercise you're comfortable with with that you can actually do and you can progressively increase in terms of the intensity um you're not going to be you have to stop and change your extra size you're not going to have to move around it's like a circuit isn't great here because you got to put one Implement down pick up another one you want to be doing something where there is literally not a second of off switch so similar exercise Choice principles we just covered if you going become a real Savage and you want to do repeats here you can um endurance folks will do that a lot one M repeat 800 M repeats things like that or I'm not sure what the swimming distance equivalents would be but swimmers would do this constantly but you don't need to this is really hard it's pretty hard in the system it's very good for you one to twice a week of hitting this I think you'll be in a really really good spot um frequency we sort of just covered we covered exercise Choice volume we just sort of nailed and intensity is basically running you up to the top there now because you can only do that so often you want to add in another 40 or so% of your time being lower intensity support work for that so this is something probably less than 85% of your heart rate but higher than quote unquote Zone 2 you got to be working here this is not I could have a conversation Pace this is higher than that it's in between conversation pace and the pace I need to be at to run my fastest mile I've ever done that's that middle ground and you need to train that so that you can continue to work on capitalization oxygen Transportation but you're not burning down the house getting all the way up to 100 100 plus% of your voo Max could I use a uh a crude version of this where I say okay I'm going to exercise for 10 minutes I'm going to go as fast as I safely can and every week I'm going to measure how far I travel yep easy in that 10 minutes love it probably not on the same day that I'm doing the Anor robic capacity work probably not if probably okay to do after a strength training or hypertrophy workout as long as I didn't train legs you could um it's probably going to compromise recovery is the way so I would if you're going to do a session like this I would probably do it on its own day unless you wanted to do something like speed or power then you could roll right into this and have no problem maybe a strength day a hypertrophy day I'm not sure um you would do there because again especially if you did any sort of lower body exercise you're going to be compromised here but remember these tend to be full body movements so even if you did arms that day your arms are going to be compromised and you don't want to fail this because of local muscular failure all right so now I've got my work cut out for me I'm going to be doing five to six minutes per week of all out work divided into 60 20 a 60c bouts with sufficient rest and I'm going to give myself 10 minutes a week of in my case it'll probably be running as fast as I can because I do enjoy running and I can do it safely um maybe uphill and see how far I go yep if you want to combine the two so if you're just saying hey I'm bought in Andy like I want to do both of these things they are similar but they have independent benefits I'm convinced how would I build these into the same week um maybe do one of each that still gets you at quote unquote two days per week where you're going to hit a maximum heart rate so we already checked that box off so one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one and the other one can simply be a five to 15 minute maximum work and you're done long duration endurance exercise the stereotypical endurance exercise sure how far how long how fast or how slow should rather uh should I go and here I'm going to Venge Ure that exercise choice is one that we could click off even at this point in the discussion because obviously it's got to be something that I can do for a long while without getting injured uh overuse injuries um there's a little bit of novelty we can actually throw in here so one of the things I love to do for long duration endurance for people who don't love running cycling or swimming is you can do a really cool workout any number of things where you can put a little circuit together as long as there's not a lot of downtime between one circuit to the next time you can actually do something as simple as like maybe you're going to do Farmer's carries and you'll do that for say three minutes and you'll set those down and you you'll go straight into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe body weight squats for two minutes then you go straight into another exercise and you you can sort of rotate things around um maybe you can do even some like Shadow Boxing stuff or some jump rope you can do gymnastics movements and body weight movements and you can run that thing through and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel like you're doing oh my gosh this mind-numbing type of training if it feels like that to you um another way you can do that to actually even simplify it even more um we've done this at Kenny Kane's gym plenty of times where you just maybe even pick three machines so you're going to go I'm going to go 10 minutes on the rower then I'm going to go 10 minutes on the treadmill and I'm going to go 10 minutes on the bike you can actually knock a 30 minute quote unquote steady state session out in and not feel those problems if those things happen so you can actually have a lot of fun there we will do uh a lot of times with our Fighters we'll do things like put a very low load I'm talking sub 50% of your max on a barbell and you're going to squat and you're going to do you know maybe a minute you're going to put that down and then you're going to go over and do 50% of a bench press you're going to put that down you're going to go over and do 50% of a of a crab walk and then and you're going to go over and do another one and you can actually run through this entire thing you don't hit that many reps in any individual movement the load is very very light and you can keep heart rate basically a steady state and do 15 or 20 or 30 different exercises and it's actually like fairly fun and engaging uh to do and it's a little bit more specific than trying to get a 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes which is not going to be good so I I'm just chuckling because I love to run outdoors and I've en joyed runs on all my travels and I find it to be a great way to see different places and I like moving through space but there are weather conditions and times when that's not an option so what you described as a terrific alternative I have to assume that the specific adaptation that's occurring here is related to the fat burdening system and again that doesn't necessarily mean fat loss corre overall but fat burning system and yet I do have a question which is can you build enhanced micro capillary systems into the muscles uh by doing this long duration cardio yeah absolutely you can in fact depending on which paper you uh like more than the other papers um you may even find evidence that this is a superior method than anything else so steady state endurance is very important I used to not like it as much there's just so much evidence now that suggests it's probably a really good thing for basically everybody maybe for some individuals it's not in all year of their training but if if you're not a high level athlete or have a very specific goal that's right in front of you it's probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week for basically any training goal outside of again a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening um the other thing that kind of kicks in here that we haven't really talked about is now actually reaching a position where fatigue of the intercostal starts to play so diaphragm fatigue starts to run into indication so we forget generally breathing is a contraction to open up the lungs to change pressure so the air will flow in and then the exhalation is passive right it's just a muscle's been stretched it goes back to this resting when you get to a maximum heart rate inhalation and exhalation become active so you're squeezing as hard as you can to open up and you're squeezing to contract to blow air out you're going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contracted contracted open up if that system starts to get fatigued you start running into failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion um there's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore the time domain is long and Slow Earth so we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel we also have plenty of time to use anerobic and aerobic glycolysis and clear out waste products so we don't really see pH being a problem with this type of exercise you may start running low on liver glycogen if you're going a very long time muscle glycogen may start getting low but not really these are huge issues you're going to run into Maybe a little bit of a stroke volume issue but the intensity is not high enough to become a problem you're more likely to break down posturally or breathing mechanics than really anything else unless again that duration really gets generally past two hours for most people so those are the things that are going to limit us so how do we improve it what do we train we went through the exercise choices you also need to make sure you're training your intercostals we need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion again it can be the exercise itself can be your normal training the thing you need to be careful of here and this is actually true for all the things we just talked about when we think about fatigue and we think about failure and endurance we really need to pay attention to technical breakdown that is always the marker we look for so when we when we go through our stuff with our athletes and they quote unquote fail or they finish that's generally because we saw a massive technical breakdown you're done like you're over there it's not always the case during all year round of the training but this is something to really pay attention to so if you're on that bike and you're 40 seconds in and all of a sudden posture starts hunching over I may stop the test I may stop the training it's like no what we decided to failure was is when you lost your Technique to some sufficient level um so you want to pay attention to that too because that's going to determine your ability to perform well as well as maintain efficiency which is a really big problem here tell me if the protocol I'm about to describe would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate 60 to 120 Minutes of long duration work per week so one way to accomplish that that I often use is to head out for a weight vested hike it's not a heavy weight vest it's maybe I think it's eight or 10 pounds it's one of these thinner ones and if people don't have access to that you can bring a backpack with some items in it I mean it can be as simple external load it can just be your body that's okay great and and do some hiking at a at a fast enough clip that I'm breathing harder than I would be if I just kind of shuffled along I might stop here or there drink some water no big deal but I can carry on a conversation if I need to so it's Zone 2ish but probably pushing a little bit harder than that for that duration yeah not a lot of um deep soreness occurring after this maybe a little bit of achiness and some stabilization muscles that were used that may not be too much especially if I've been sitting a lot during the week um kind of reminds me of how much I've been sitting uh but doing that all in one Long Afternoon um typically on a weekend or doing two shorter sessions throughout the week maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes and then working up the progression to longer longer duration seems like that would be something that most people um should be able to do y and that it would weave in well with any resistance training or the uh anerobic and aerobic output capacity work that we talked about just a moment ago great that's a fine version to do it if you want to go shorter and bring up the intensity a little bit so you want to keep it more to the 30 to 60 Minute range and go you know closer into the I can't have a conversation right now but again I'm not at a blistering heart rate um then you could probably get that same thing done in a smaller time window if that was a consideration so if you wanted to blend all three of these together you have a lot of wiggle room right so you could do something like order if we're talking about this type of training you could do this first and then finish with either one of the higher intensity stuff we talked about so it could be roped into the same thing it could be its own independent day could be your sort of active recovery day it tends to be fairly restorative as you alluded to a little bit there so it's not that big a deal to do this on your quote unquote off day if you're those if you're that type of person who like even on your off day you have to do something physical this is fine right um if you wanted to do it on a lifting day especially if it's a power or strength day it's probably fine if you wanted to do it before the workout or after either way you're probably okay probably best to do it after if the primary goal is one of the strength training adaptations if it's not if this is the primary goal do it first amazing uh if you wanted to do it in the combination with the other interval stuff you could do it fine there you could do it before or or you could do it afterwards I actually have no problem doing it afterwards because that in effect especially if you say nasal only during this training will help the down regulation go and so you can finish that fairly well down regulated actually so it's kind of like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up go really really hard and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down and by the time you finish maybe even on a three minute walk nice slow nasal breathing 4 second inhale four second inhale maybe five you play with the numbers a little bit then maybe you don't even need to do the down regulation breathing afterwards you'll be in a good spot you wouldn't want to do this before do your intervals finish your intervals throw up lay on the ground sweat all over the gym floor get up and go back to work that's probably not our best strategy as people are hearing this all they may be thinking wow this is a lot of work to do but I've been keeping track of the math here I'm sure some some of you out there are as well and we're really talking about 10 minutes of the of running or sprinting on the bike or rower once a week we're talking about six minutes or so of the much higher intensity but short bouts divided into rounds of 20 to 20 seconds to a minute with with rest in between and then some longer duration workout of 30 minutes minimum but maybe as much as an hour even two hours which in total doesn't really equate to that much time especially if one can access these things right out their front door or at home and as we pointed out you don't need any specialized equipment to do that oh and I forgot the um uh muscular endurance I I wasn't trying to cheat there um some muscular endurance thrown in as well so that brings me to a question which is if I'm doing my training for muscular endurance each week for Anor robic capacity and for maximum aerobic out output and long duration and given that all of that it's going to take roughly two hours for the typical person total for the entire week which I would argue is going to give you back so much life literally in terms of longevity you're literally going to earn back years of your life productivity you name it offsetting all sorts of uh metabolic issues and uh enhancing your sleep and and improving mood I mean there's so much data so much data pointing to all those positive benefits if I do all of these things and I'm fairly consistent about them am I going to be metabolically flexible am I going to have a well-developed fat burning carbohydrate burning system and will I be essentially fit I mean this is not leaving aside issues of strength and hypertrophy which were covered in the previous episode will I be fit I mean to my mind um the ability to you know Sprint very fast if one needs to the ability to go longer duration if one needs to and the ability to do something in between as well as you know hold a box overhead if necessary while installing a shelf or something like that these are the realities of life um and to me represent real functional World Fitness if that's the case is there anything that we would want to add to this program or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive and complete endurance training system if we remember the target which is I want to have energy I want to look a certain way and you want to be able to do that for the duration of your life for a very long life this style of training where you incorporate all of those areas of endurance gives you all of the necessary adaptations one would need to execute all of those things remember fat loss or weight management is not best done with any individual style of protocol so if you do a little bit of all three of these you've checked that fat loss box you don't need to go out and do anything separate for it you've done all the things then to cover Aesthetics from that side of the equation right you've done the things to both enhance mitochondria to enhance blood flow increase oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste development boom energy is there fatigue is there I'm not going to get tired or have to quit or stop or sit down doing any of these activi as I want at the same time if you look at the literature on mortality one of the strong strongest predictors of how long you're going to live is your V2 Max so we've set up a scenario in which you're going to hit all three of those primary goals by doing a combination of this training you're not going to miss any plausible adaptation from endurance training and you should be set for regardless of your goal incredible and as I understand totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training provided that your goal is to also be strong and also selectively hypertrophy or generally hypertrophy your muscles or maintain your muscles for many people that are listening to this I'm guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance but not just the ability to go further but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that com bins these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance uh the higher intensity short duration Sprints would be expected to improve their longer duration work and how perhaps their longer duration work um can progress if they are careful to include uh some planks and some wall sits and and things of that sort I ask this question specifically because I have to believe that while there probably are some folks out there that are looking to maximize their plank from week to week to week typically it seems that people fall into these categories of either wanting to get stronger and get bigger muscles to varying degrees or to get better at endurance or to get better at everything overall right now I'd really like to just focus on what you think is a nice Contour of a program for the person that wants to get better at endurance but do it with more speed more stability and just feel like a strong endurance Runner cycler swimmer or whatever Happ happen to be their endurance event okay great so let's just give an example maybe you want to run your first half marathon something like that okay uh maybe done it a couple times before but you want to get better at that time I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70% of your you know mileage in the moderate intensity Zone okay so you need to accumulate mileage and you need to be able to handle what we call the tissue tolerance so in this case your feet need to be able to handle 13 miles of pounding okay it doesn't matter how much high heart rate training you do or your fat deliverability none of that matters if your feet are blown up by mile eight okay so in addition we talked about how even training in that 70 to 85% heart rate zone is quite effective at oxygen delivery fat utilization capitalization Etc so you're going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits from that work you're also going to be working on what's honestly going to be one of your limiting factors which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding okay in addition you need to be efficient with your Technique and you need a lot of repetitions for motor skill development so you want to spend most of your time there it's easy to recover from it's not extremely um demanding and challenging awesome that leaves you with another 30 or 40% of training I would spend 10% of that in that like 20 second burst area you're going to drive up fatigue extremely high and you're going to really maximize your ability to recover from um waste production all right great I would spend the remaining amount of time either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff that could actually be in the 202 burst if you're really trying to go as fast as you can at the beginning of that exercise and then the rest of it I would spend in that other Zone which is more of like the five to 15 minutes but you're probably going to want to repeat those and this is when things like 800 meter run rest for double the time and then repeat that two or three times you actually need that in this scenario because you're going to need to be able to be running for two most people are going to do half marathon in maybe around two hours or so something like that and so you want a little bit of what we call repeated endurance right so be able to handle that higher heart rate come back down do it again at the same time that's actually how you bump your mileage up so instead of having just do more of these long duration distance runs you can still get maybe five or six miles done in a day if you're going to do a one mile repeat or whatever number you're looking at so for a lot of people that's kind of how I would structure it um that's honestly is very similar to what we laid out in the previous conversation which is getting to this idea that more than 50% should be basically practice a little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum but not too much and then a little bit of work at the other end and you should be in a good spot a major mistake one would make here is only doing the long duration steady state stuff and just sort of saying say I'm going to run five miles this week and then do six miles next week and seven it might work for you it's I think we have enough evidence at this point both in the scientific realm as well as most of the coaches I think in this space would agree with me is that's a suboptimal strategy so it could work but we can do better and in terms of the structure of a program like this I realize that those structures vary tremendously different coaches and different books and different programs are going to say oh you should run Monday through Friday with weekends off or every other day but in terms of this 70% um 30% divide where 70% is going toward the specific event you know doing the kind of work that you're going to do during the specific event that you're most interested in cultivating or improving and the remaining 30% coming from other sorts of uh of supporting uh work how should one think about Distributing that other 30% should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery for the 70% or in other words um could I do all that 30% work on one day I probably would split it into two days um that's the reality it is so if you're thinking man coach wants me to train six days a week my schedule is tight I can pull off four to five okay great what I might say is two of those days are just your your tempo right this is what like a runner would call this like Tempo training um kind of in that space remind us what tempo training is just to 80% effort range where you're like running at probably the same stride length and and rate that you're going to run your race at maybe a little bit lower but something similar your practicing skill you're acing mileage and you're getting a little you're getting work and for sure work but it's not absolutely the fastest you can Sprint it's also not conversation so this would be the um what before we referred to as the 10 minutes of of fast running or 10 minutes of fast R this is lower intensity than that got it this is um this is work accumulation got it this is practice St um then one of the days a week I would probably enter in that 202 30 second burst for a little bit of speed there and then one of the other days is when I would do that true high intensity as hard as I can for hitting a VO2 max something like that so that's probably how I'd break it up if I had like four days a week if you had five you can maybe add in another day where you do more of that uh volume accumulation practice work um but that's that's a pretty good well this is the point in the episode where I say thank you ever so much you provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting clear information that's also actionable I do feel as if I far better understand endurance in its many forms and even the Sellar underpinnings of that and even subcellar underpinnings of what endurance adaptations are and how to Foster those through specific protocols things that not only I can do tomorrow but that I will do tomorrow and where I hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is vitally important and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met even while certain forms of exercise tap into fat stores more than others and you beautifully Illustrated the relationship between energy utilization and breathing and the fact that we literally exhale fat to to some extent of course so once again thank you thank you and thank you I know I'm not alone in um recognizing this information as incredibly interesting and and actionable and indeed I do plan to put it into action as I I hope many of our listeners will as well yet again the pleasure is actually all mine and uh I actually really appreciate the fact that you let me go so far into metabolism my PhD is in human bioenergetics so anytime I can go many hours into metabolism I get very excited and I don't typically get that leash um in this format so I appreciate that I know you understand your audience will love that hopefully oh they they'll love it and I think that they'll especially love it because they understand that if one can wrap their head around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms that underly a given protocol it gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol and makes it so much more flexible for people they can really think about what's happening as they're engaging in a given protocol and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results Great we've been on a bit of a journey here we've covered a lot of ground with speed development and strength and hypertrophy and now we walk through you know probably several hours here of of endurance what I would love to do next is to just give you a more straightforward not as much background not as much metabolism none of the mechanisms right into protocols for someone who says look I want to hit those marks you keep talking about I want to look good I want to feel good and I want to do that across my lifespan how would I build all these things into a protocol that actually covers maybe the entire year and how what I would be able to repeat that year after year so I almost have this Evergreen sustainable year-long periodization structure that covers all the nodes I need to if I want everything we've talked about in these nine adaptations in this short Series so I would love to do that in our next conversation if you're learning from Andor

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Sarah gotfried Dr Sarah gotfried is an obstetrician gynecologist who did her undergraduate training in bioengineering at the University of Washington in Seattle she then completed her medical training at Harvard Medical School and she currently is a clinical Prof professor of Integrative Medicine and nutritional Sciences at Thomas Jefferson University she has also been a clinician treating men and women in various aspects of Hormone Health and Longevity for more than 20 years she is an expert in not just traditional medicine as it relates to hormones and fertility but also nutritional practices supplementation and behavioral practices and combining all of that expertise in order to help women navigate every aspect and dimension of their hormones longevity and vitality ranging from puberty to Young adulthood adulthood perimenopause and menopause and nowadays she's also treating men across the lifespan in terms of longevity vitality and Hormone Health during today's discussion Dr gried shares an enormous amount of information and tools that women can apply toward their Hormone Health fertility vitality and Longevity we discussed the gut microbiome which many people have heard about but Dr Godfrey points out the specific needs that women have in terms of managing their gut microbiome and the ways that that influences things like estrogen levels and Metabolism testosterone thyroid and growth hormone and much more we also discuss nutrition and exercise we touch on how the omega-3 fatty acids play a particularly important role in managing female hormone Health Dr gried points out why women have particular needs when it comes to essential fatty acids and how best to obtain those essential fatty acids for Hormone Health we also discuss exercise and she offers some surprising information about the types ratios of resistance training to cardiovascular training that women ought to use in order to maximize their Hormone Health we also talk a lot about the digestive system this was a surprising aspect of the conversation I did not anticipate Dr gried shared with us for instance that women suffer from digestive issues at more than 10 times the frequency that do men and fortunately that there are tools specific to women that they can use in order to overcome those digestive issues and that in overcoming those digestive issues they can overcome many of the related hormone issues that so many women face Dr gried also shares with you tremendous knowledge about the specific types of tests not just blood tests but also urine and microbiome tests that women can use in order to really get a clear understanding of their hormone status not just of present but also where the trajectory of their hormones is taking them so we have an avid discussion about puberty about young adulthood adulthood per menopause and how best to manage and navigate per menopause and menop pause including a discussion about hormone replacement therapy in addition to her academic and clinical expertise Dr gotfried has authored many important books on nutrition hormones and supplementation as it relates to women and to people generally the two books that I'd like to highlight and that we' provided links to in the show note captions are women food and hormones and the hormone cure I read the hormone cure and found it to be tremendously interesting and informative not just in terms of teaching me about female hormone health and various treatments for female hormone Health but also as a man trying to understand how the endocrine system interacts with mindset nutrition and supplementation more generally so I highly recommend the hormone cure for anybody interested in hormones and Hormone Health and women food and hormones in particular for women although again both books are going to be strongly informative for women wishing to optimize their Hormone Health vitality and Longevity before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly so for instance when you go from a very brightly lit area to a dim lit area your visual system has to make all sorts of adjustments that allow you to still see your environment Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were built with the biology of the visual system in mind so no matter what environment you're in you'll be able to see with perfect clarity and they have terrific Aesthetics and enormous number of choices in terms of Aesthetics so unlike a lot of so-call performance eyeglasses out there that only give you the option to wear the ones that make you look like a cyborg they have those options but they also have a lot of options with Aesthetics that you would be perfectly comfortable wearing to work or to dinner or anywhere else if you'd like to try Roa glasses you can go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout today's episode is also brought To Us by thesis thesis makes custom neut tropics and as many of you know I'm not a fan of the word neut tropics because neut Tropics means smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart thesis understands this and has designed different neut Tropics in order to bring your brain into specific States for specific types of work so for instance for Creative work or to engage with more Focus or to give you more energy for cognitive or physical work so with thesis they'll design custom neut Tropics for you that will allow you more focus better task switching more creativity and so on and they'll be sure to include only the ingredients that you want and not the ingredients that you don't I've been using thesis for more than a year now and I can confidently say that their neut Tropics have been a total GameChanger for me I like the clarity formula prior to Long bouts of cognitive work or the energy formula prior to physical workouts if you'd like to try your own personalized neut Tropic starter kit go online to take thesis. huberman you'll take a brief three-minute quiz and thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month again that's take thesis. huberman and use the code hubber minute checkout for 10% off your first box today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sod magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished so with element you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lnt.com huberman and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious so again if you want to try element you can go to element lm.com huberman the huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements to find the supplements we discuss on the hubman Lab podcast you can go to live momentous spelled o us liv.com huberman and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's liv.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Sarah gotfried Dr gotfried Sarah welcome thank you so happy to be here yeah I'm delighted and very excited to ask you about an enormous number of topics you are expert in so so many things so uh the challenge for me is going to be to uh constrain this walk as it were but uh I'm hoping that we can touch on a great number of things today the first of which is really about hormones and female hormones in particular and I have a question which is is it ever informative for a woman regardless of age to know something about her mother's perhaps even her grandmother's experience VIs V hormones not just pregnancy challenges with or um ease with pregnancy and child rearing child birth this sort of thing but you know what sorts of conversations should women be having with themselves and with family members to get a window into what their specific needs might be love this question so my work is really at interface between genetics and environment so your question gets to both and I think it's essential that you understand what your grandmother went through I'd even say your great-grandmother depending on longevity in your family so I grew up with my great-grandmother I get that and especially your mother so I would probably start first with trauma an intergenerational trauma because I think that affects the endocrine system so hugely especially cortisol signaling but the broader Pine system Psycho imuno neuroendocrine System and then there's you know if I think about the stages the life cycle that a woman goes through if you think about puberty I think I don't know how genetically determined the age of puberty is certainly there's a lot of environmental influences like toxins can affect it but um pregnancy the age at which you start to go through per menopause menopause many of those have a genetic component so with pregnancy I mean you can certainly think the shape of the pelvis your ability to have a vaginal birth some of that is genetically determined I mean you do have you know the the sperm donor affecting some of that but you know in my family for instance we have no cesarian sections so everyone goes through this process of a relatively easy national birth I was a forceps baby but you know for the most part um you can find out about that and then there's certain female conditions that have a very strong component genetically most of which run in my family so that includes enmet trios fibroids I just had a hysterectomy I had a 50 plus fibroids and uh polycystic ovarian syndrome and of those three uh how fre are those and um maybe I can constrain the question a little bit by saying um today's discussion I imagine is going to be heard by men and women of all sorts of Ages so I um maybe I'll direct the question a little bit toward you know at what age should these discussions start um you know we always imagine that uh women in their um 30s and 40s and 50s and onward should be getting certain tests and um addressing things like uh ovarian reserve and and other sorts of things but you know maybe we could March through and just say for a woman in her teens who's already hit puberty what sorts of biomarkers whether not their blood-based or per or um phenotyping you know the outward appearance of uh should those young women be paying attention to likewise for women in their 20s 30s maybe we could take it a more or less by by decade at starting at puberty assuming that woman hits puberty sometime what between what is it now the average in the US is somewhere between 12 and 16 years years old do I have that right no you do not oh great I love to be wrong so so it used to be 12 to 16 I would say 50 years ago it's been moving younger and we think some of that is related to toxin exposure as I mentioned but I was 10 when I went through puberty so uh well I should say menarchy and I started growing breasts much before that so I think now I'm going to step away from the science for a moment I'm going to do that pretty fluidly and I'll try to call it out I think there's also a huge influence from stress and like the development of the adrenal glands so going back to the science the issue in teenage years is that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and I like to think of it broader so stay with me I hypothalamic pituitary adrenal gatal over recent women testes and Men thyroid gut axis so that to me is the control system so I'm kind of expressing my bioengineering side here well I think it's great to include the other organs and tissue systems of the body because as we both know that the narrow definition of just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal it can't be just that right no it can't right no yeah it doesn't tell the whole story so if you look at the the main sex hormones in a a young woman who's in her teenage years the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal gatal part of that is not fully mature so they're more likely to skip periods especially under stress they have a lot of influences that really doesn't get well established until you're done with adolesence and I'm told that adolescence now is till like age 25 to 26 I heard that I was like I've got two daughters and I was thinking that's a really long time not just psychologically defined or bio psych mostly mostly psychologically defined I heard that from a psychologist so biomarkers you asked about in your teenage years what I think is really interesting is to look at cortisol to look at the dance between estrogen and progesterone in those years is less helpful because I I think there's a lot of variability due to the immaturity of the system if you've got someone who's got really regular periods it's probably better to do some benchmarking at that age but generally I find that benchmarking is best performed in your 20s or 30s are periods not that regular in terms of duration of the menstrual cycle when the menstrual cycle first sets in it depends so I was like clockwork every 28 days until I had my hysterectomy in August same thing with my daughters I've got two daughters one's 17 the other's 23 for a lot of women they're not regular and then there's the whole piece of oral contraceptives and other forms of contraception where you have no idea what the normal cycle is and I hope we'll have some time to talk a little bit about oral contraceptives because I think it is this is now opinion again and not science I think it is the number one endocrinopathy that is iatrogenic for women uh we will definitely talk about I get a lot of questions about oral contraceptives um in the social media space and also questions about iuds quite a lot totally in particular copper iuds non non- hormonal iuds so we will definitely touch on that I'm an IUD Crusader so I just want to you know give you that warning you're you're a fan do I have that right or you're anti I'm a huge fan uhuh which iuds in particular so I like copper because it's non hormonal it's as effective as getting your tubes died who would have thought it's that toxic to the sperm Mobility is that how it works that's my understanding of it is that that it that it basically it's like a uh more or less an electric fence to the the sperm cap and just that's it electric fence is a bit of a harsh analogy but I'll work with that but it's you know to have something that can last for 10 years so that you really have complete autonomy and sovereignty over your sexual life that's profound and to not get all those Downstream risks that are associated with birth control pill the other thing that's important to know about it I know this is a zore women who use the copper IUD have the highest satisfaction rate of anyone on contraceptives the highest satisfaction rate and yet it is the least used of all forms of interception now my favorite is vasectomy but short of vasectomy I think the IID is a really great choice there are some risks associated with it I'm not saying it's risk-free but I love the ID and I love it for younger women too because it used to be that when I went through my training which was 30 years ago we were told you know don't put it in someone who hasn't had a baby and that is patriarchal messaging but getting back to your original question which is about biomark per decade in your 20s that's when you want to do some base casing with estrogen progesterone and testosterone so I think it's really helpful to know about this this Tango you're from Argentina or your father I have Argentine lineage yes yeah my grandparents did Tango into their late 80s I I am I'm in my late 40s and I I still haven't started so I suppose there's time it might be time for you to that okay and it might be a factor in their longevity do they have good health span not justan and my grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp until he died in his late 90s but um almost burned down their apartment several times falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth so I don't recommend anyone Smoke by the way uh but it was uh coffee mate red meat and cigarettes and they lived into their 90s so that side of my family has the genetic Advantage the other side less so um but in any event um Tango um is a is a 2023 goal it has been every year um the uh I'm gonna hold you accountable to that okay we'll do and there no there will be no YouTube video of me doing thing at least not initially Tim Ferris actually a phenomenal podcaster as we know is a he's a badass he's a badass Tango Tango dancer I know this through various sources yes yeah I've seen yeah so this Tango between estrogen and progesterone is incredibly important you want to have the the right lead you want to have the right follow between the two hormones again I'm stepping away from my science hat but what happens a lot of the time is that estrogen dominates in that Tango and when that happens it sets you up for a greater risk of fibroids enetri posis breast pain probably in association with the microbiome in the estrobolome oh can you familiarize me with the estrobolome I'm delighted know that I don't recognize the term yeah so the estrobolome is the set of microbes in and their DNA their DNA mostly in the gut microbiome that set of microbes in their DNA so it's in the if you look at the totality the subset of particular bacteria modulate estrogen levels so a lot of this work was spearheaded by Martin Blazer and what we know is that there are some women who have an estrobolome that makes them have a greater risk of certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast cancer and amral cancer and in men prostate cancer so the estrom is incredibly important there's not a lot of attention paid to it but I always think in terms of my patients you know could this be someone who's got faulty estrobolome and we need to adjust it with you know some of the microbiome uh modulating uh nutrients nutrical that we have so that they're less likely to have that that Tango that's not working with estrogen and progesterone so getting back to the biomarkers if if you gave me an unlimited budget which I kind of have with some of my um clients that I work with now what I would want to know is estrogen progesterone testosterone and I want the timing right for that I'd want to know about DHEA and sort of the whole Androgen pathway I'd want to know about the metabolites of estrogen because some of them are protective and very helpful others are a bit like Homer Simpson I mean they are just like causing all kinds of problems in your body increasing the risk of Quinones like d damage and potentially an increased risk of breast cancer although that data I think is mixed I'd also like to know about their stool so I want to know about the microbiome so the best that we have right now is to look uh when we do stool testing and I do a lot of stool testing we can look at things like beta glucuronidase are you familiar with BG I'm familiar with it as a term and so for those listening it very often not always when you hear an acea you're dealing with an enzyme so we can take a stab there and and it sounds like it's somehow involved in um glucose metabolism of some sort or is it glucuronidation so it's involved in when you produce estrogen in the body this is like the simplified version but when you produce estrogen you are meant to use it like send it to The receptors where it's meant to go and then lose it like you don't want to keep recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma and that's what happens with people who have high bet beta glucuronidase so it's this enzyme that's produced by three bacteria in particular in the gut and I see a lot of men and women who have elevated beta glucuronidase and then they have some estrogen dominance related to that is that the total reason we don't really know but it's one of the drivers it's one of the levers and it can be detected from a microbiome AK stool sample that's right and terms of blood testing or various tests for these other biomarkers getting estrogen testosterone and other ratios I I realize there are people have different means financial means but in general people wanting to do a blood test it sounds like they're going to need to do it what women will need to do it at different stages of their menstrual cycle if they had to pick one you know either in the follicular phase and or in the ludal stage of their ovarian menstrual cycle excuse me ovulatory menstrual cycle when would you suggest they do that if they had to pick one so if you forced me to pick one I would say probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her 20s so we're focused right now on that decade so for most women they've got a menstrual cycle date that averages out at 28 days so this is about a week before they start their period for women who are more regular it's harder to do that as women get older and we'll talk about this in a moment usually the the cycle gets a little shorter so as they start to decline in their progesterone production their period gets a little closer together like mine before August was about every 26 days so at that point you want to test sooner like day 19 20 and I'm not talking about a blood test so a blood test is the cheapest thing it's usually what's covered by insurance but my preference would be to do dried urine I like to use saliva for cortisol I like to use dried urine so that I get metabolomics in addition to the levels of these hormones and if I'm forced to I'll use blood testing and that's certainly the gold standard for all of these hormones that we're talking about but um it's not as comprehensive and as you know it's a quick little snapshot while the needle's in your vein for you know 30 seconds yeah the salivary cortisol makes sense to me because my understanding is that you get free cortisol which is the active cortisol you said with urine you're also getting the metabolites that's right and then um for blood testing you're getting sort of a crude window into the averages a static total level so uh let me go back and say one other thing about biomarkers a big part of the testing that I do in phenotyping my patients I practice Precision medicine so I I like to almost start with nutritional testing I don't think I've ever had a teenager I've got some NBA players that are 19 20 21 so maybe those count but uh those are men obviously but for nutritional testing that would be potentially a helpful thing to do in your 20s becomes less important as you get older and you develop more micronutrient deficiencies but micronutrients play a huge role in terms of hormone production magnesium you know the Magnesium is hugely involved in the way that you get rid of estrogen as an example so micronutrient testing what I usually do is a combination of blood and urine and so I'm looking at all of the micronutrients that we can measure that have some clinical scientific basis behind them if I could do that for a teenager I think it might be helpful because I recently gave a lecture on breast cancer RIS reduction another quick sidebar and I was sad to find that intake of vegetables polyphenols is such an important predictor of future risk of breast cancer like when you're 50 60 plus and the most important time is when you're a teenager now I have one daughter that eats vegetables she loves them and I have another daughter who eats food that's beige and it's very hard to get her to eat the volume of vegetables you know five colors a day which is what I do and if you have evidence that you could show a 17-year-old that they've got micronutrient gaps I think that would be a motivator for them to eat differently at a time when it's so critical even though it's you know 25 years in the future that it's going to potentially change this Arc that they're on what do you do for a young woman who doesn't like vegetables is or is not somehow able or willing to to get those five colors a day of vegetable to help support the microbiome you know are supplements a useful tool in that case um what other sorts of tools Behavioral or otherwise are useful such a good question so here I'm going to invoke Rob Knight at UCSD so I think his his uh his gut project has really been helpful in terms of understanding what kind of modulators are going to be important so what I try to get that person to do and I don't see many teens anymore other than NBA players what I try to get them to do is to have a smoothie very hard to get them to have a smoothie every day but if I could get them to have a smoothie three times a week and to throw some of these vegetables in that makes a huge difference I mean we know that makes a difference in terms of microbiome change she be blending up broccoli or kale cauliflower so cauliflower great even they're putting things into the Smoothie yeah I don't know if you can get a teenager to do that but they often will use like I have them do steamed broccoli that's in the freezer because it's got very little taste so that they could do that in a chocolate smoothie they could add some greens I like greens powders are was super convenient so that with you know kind of a a taste that they like whether that's chocolate which is what most of my clients want or you know vanilla with berries and that sort of thing so that can go a long way if you don't like vegetables and short of that I would say some supplements but I would say that's a distant second to making a smoothie I've got one patient that I have to mention because um he took this to the extreme so he's a retired physicist professor at UCSD he found out that his microbiome was a hot mess and um developed autoimmune disease and so he became hellbent like only a physicist could on changing his microbiome and he dramatically shifted it by having a smoothie every day with 57 vegetables and fruits in it 57 independent 57 independent so I mean this just warms my heart the way that he did this but he would go to the farmers market he would just get a bunch of this a bunch of that and he would go home make the smoothie and then stick it in the freezer so he'd have a serving every day and he became a completely different person based on this microbiome change his uh autoimmune disease is in remission he um he dropped a huge amount of weight he went from being you know kind of this phenotype that I know you know well of a professor High performing traveling around the world on so many boards so much Innovation so many great ideas super computer guy to being someone who gets up in the morning gets in his hot tub EX exercises for like 1 to two hours a day and then does a little work like he completely shifted the way that he lives and his microbiome shift you know who knows what what's the chicken and what the what's the egg there but he had a huge change in his physiology glucose went from being quite high he had and he tracks all of this of course it's like on S after all right and retired I suppose might have had and he's retired but he's he's got the Longest Time series of anyone I know and he's tracked his glucose and Insulin going back 20 years so he can show you okay here's where I started having my smoothie and here's how my glucose and Insulin changed as a result of that I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's athletic greens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 is there a case for I'll say young women but young women and men um using over-the-counter probiotics as a way to enhance the microbiome this is something I hear about a lot I've heard that excessive doses of capsule probiotics can give a brain fog like condition um I personally don't use capsule probiotics unless I feel like my system is under a significant amount of stress in which case I might add that in for brief periods of time or if I've just taken antibiotics for a period of time right uh do you ever recommend that the college student or the high school student that she or he take capsule probiotics assuming that they're getting let's say three to five servings of vegetables per day either in smoothie form or some other form what are your thoughts on on supplementing probiotics it sounds like such a simple question it is such a complex answer and I don't think we really have the answer so I'll tell you the way that I approach it I look for randomized trials to support my use of probiotics and frankly I'm underwhelmed so I've seen some data if I invoke my um NBA players for a moment almost every player I've tested has increased intestinal permeability they just have such a high training load probably mediated by cortisol very high glucoses when they drain that they have increased intestinal permeability so those tight junctions in their intestine become loose they develop a lot of inflammation as a result of that and when you're a professional NBA player and you're making 20 million a year like you don't want a lot of inflammation you want a little bit to like help your muscles recover but you don't want it to be um adding to problems when you develop an injury so this is leaky gut leaky gut I don't love that term but yeah we'll use it here so there's a there's a particular probiotic that is helpful in athletes with leaky gut so that's the kind of specificity and randomized trial that I'm looking for the rest of it I think there's support if you find help from it as you described if you take a course of antibiotics I mean first of all I would question whether you need them but I try and avoid them there there have been instances where they've been prescribed and I took them mostly in the past I was in college they seem like they kind of gave them out you had a sinus infection they give you you know antibiotics you like yeah the worst treatment ever yeah so if you're coming off of antibiotics I think that's a good time to do what we call replacement dose Pro biotics I think what's far more interesting is prebiotics I think the data is much better for prebiotics and um The Selective use of polyphenols how would a person in their teens and 20s or any age for that matter know what whether or not they have nutritional deficiencies what is the best way to analyze if one is getting enough magnesium um and for that matter what is going to be the best way to test the microbiome you said stool sample it and I'll come right back with the same question I asked about blood test what time of day when during the month um to establish this a baseline so this would be prior to embarking on a you know 97 vegetables or how per day it's only 57 well I love the idea that you're telling us if I'm gathering correctly is that yes there's a case for probiotics but for the typical person regardless of age eating more vegetables or drinking more vegetables as as the case may be is going to be beneficial for the gut microbiome perhaps without the need to go test whether or not one is making a certain number of estrogen related metabolites or not just that that's a great starting Place eat or consume more vegetables totally um but if one wants to analyze their gut microbiome are there good tests available to the general public this has been I'm not going to name companies but I've been tracking this over the years and it's never been clear to me that we know what constituents of the gut microbiome are are best you we know that dis is is bad and we know that diversity of the microbiome is good we hear this but no one's ever told me that you want a particular ratio of one microbiota to another right in a way that has made any sense to me at least totally um I'm not a microbiologist but whereas with you know with testosterone and Men we hear okay you want your free testosterone to be about 2% of your total perhaps with women you women are going to have more testosterone than estrogen on average but still less than men when you look at testosterone it's ET Etc but you can kind and get some some crude measures but for the microbiome it just seems like long lists of microbiota for which um I just get dizzy I just if you just wrote out a bunch of I's and L's and s's you'd kind halfway you getting a bit bit the same information I'm not trying to poke at that field it's a beautiful field but they haven't told me what to what I what my microbiota ought to look like like what's a healthy microbiome chart well that's because we don't know I mean the best we have is Rob nights work but even even that is limited in terms of you know can I tell you that a a woman in her 20s should have this particular pattern with her microbiome no I can't so um let me go to your first question because I think you just asked about six your first question is about nutritional testing what I like to do with nutritional testing is run a panel that's looking at antioxidants so like vitamin A vitamin C Alpha lip IC acid um plant-based antioxidants CU you can measure that in the blood I like to look at some of the key vitamins especially the B vitamin range because as you probably know if you've got particular genetic um polymorphisms you might be less likely to be absorbing the right level of vitamin B9 folate vitamin B12 Etc um I'm also looking going back to the antioxidants at glutathione because I think that's such an important lever when it comes to detoxification which we haven't talked about yet and then I'm looking at some of the Minerals Magnesium is really the most important and we know that somewhere around 70 to 80% of Americans are deficient in magnesium that's like the the lowest hanging fruit I would be curious for instance like with magnesium if that number of people are deficient does that mean that that number of people should be targeting their nutrition towards foods that contain magnesium and or supplementing with magnesium and if so what forms of magnesium we've talked about mag 3 and eight SLE there's a magit there's so many forms can be a little bit of overwhelming to people so any any detail um in sourcing would appreciate it great so first in terms of testing what I prefer to do is to mention one more than one lab and more than one brand um and I can just I'm speaking mostly from experience so uh for testing I do a lot of goova neutrals during the pandemic they developed an at home tests normally with a neutral you have to get your blood drawn and you have to do a urine sample so a lot of people can't do that the great thing about this test is your insurance usually pays for most of it and so the co-pay is about $150 so during the pandemic they developed another test called metabolomics which does much of the same testing but it's a finger prick so most of my patients prefer that in fact they haven't gone back to the neutral second lab is Spectra cell I use Spectra cell occasionally I find it not quite as easy in terms of fitting into my practice but I've got friends and mentors like Mark Houston who does a lot of uh kind of precision um cardi metabolic Health he thinks spectrol is the best test out there so you asked about magnesium you have to measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood and with deficiency it's interesting with supplementation for my patients who tend toward constipation and that's frankly about 80% of the women that I take care of really yes wow I'd be curious as to why that that is um is it I I can guess uh diet stress um patriarchy rage so psychos psych so Pine the um the pine system right psych psych olog Immunology neural and endocrine factors combined is it yes and then I would say there's another factor which is being female is a health hazard so we've twice the rate of depression insomnia we've got 3 to 4X increased risk of multiple sclerosis we've got 5 to8 times the risk of thyroid dysfunction so if you just look at that and you look at subtle preclinical thyroid dysfunction a huge number of the women that I take care of well let me back off a large number of the women that I take care of have thyroid dysfunction that's contributing to constipation and if we go back to that control system the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid gatal gut AIS and they have a lot of perceived stress together with this borderline thyroid function that no mainstream medicine doctor has told her is a problem and then she's got a problem with the Tango between estrogen and progesterone she's going to tend toward constipation women have a lot more constipation than men the gut is about 10t longer in women compared to men we should talk about some sex and gender differences and Define those sure and they are much more likely to have a torturous colon and the way you know that is you get a colonoscopy and they tell you yeah it's really hard to like get in there do what we need to do as a brief tangent but I think this is the time to ask um what at what age now do Physicians insists their female patients get colonoscopies uh for men I think the age used to be 50 now it's getting ratcheted back to 45 or 40 again these are recommendations not requirements but they're pretty strong recommendations from depending on where you live Etc um for women how early do you think they should get a colonoscopy to to explore for possible pops Andor colon cancer yeah it's a really good question I don't know the answer so what I've always operated with is 50 the way that I answer that is to go to the US preventive task force rating to determine based on their synthesis of the data what age is the most appropriate has it changed as you just described for men from 50 to younger I don't know so we should fact check that all these um additional health hazards for women um you mentioned some some of the you broadly mentioned psychological impact right and and of course these things are all related psychology immunology and one of the I think wonderful things about neuroscience and Science in general and medicine is that there's now an an understanding that all the organs are connected to one another it's a network it's a network and then the microbiome sits at at um at a key node within that Network um and I think most people accept that now yes you it that seems to be a theme that at least in the last 10 years is really wonderful because um certainly for Neuroscience it was thought that you know unless it's in the cranial Vault it's not neural which is ridiculous because there's lots of nervous system outside the the skull but in any case for can I interrupt for a second yes please so I think you're right that there's an understanding about the network effect but I think that as much as I love mainstream medicine and I trained in it and I so grateful for my education I still think it is a silo based way of taking care of patients so even if there's an understanding of the network effect more at the science level or as you described in Neuroscience there's still you know if you are a woman who has constipation fatigue um maybe an autoimmune condition uh feel stressed out all the time feel like your hormones are out of whack you get sent to the gastroenterologist for the constipation you get sent to the room dermatologist for your autoimmune issues you maybe get sent to an endocrinologist if you've got thyroid problems and there's very little collaboration between these groups so even though there's an understanding of the network effect in real life it's not happening let's um let's go deeper down that path because I you point out something really important and and you've mentioned constipation a few times can we view constipation as a serious enough symptom that it warrants an immediate intervention that is does it flag or signal problems that are severe enough that that should be the issue that's dealt with uh for anybody that's experiencing it and I mean sort of an odd topic for many people because they think oh you know bowel movements and sort of you know there's that kind of um pre-adolescent humor around this but I think it's it's so important what you're what I'm hearing you say is that constipation is far more common in women and it signals a general set many problems occurring does that mean that women should address constipation and if so what's the best way to address constipation yeah I love this question because you're doing can we have a quick little meta conversation so you're doing something that I knew you would do which is you're teaching me something and you're changing like there's this social genomics thing happening where you're changing my thought about this so I just wanted to acknowledge that thank you thank you well I think for me you know when I hear that there's a kind of you know you're talking about a phenotype constipation is a phenotype it's one that people generally don't wear a t-shirt explaining it to people but that I'm guessing anything to do with sexual health um bowel Health Urology people just don't talk about right um for all sorts of reasons and those reasons are probably so obvious that they're not even worth discussing but because and also because we won't change them except by talking about them y so if you say um women are far more constipated and that's signaling a larger set of problems yes then my immediate thought is well we relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um will that assist in a great number of issues Andor will it get them down the road of thinking about those other issues more specifically like do I need more magnesium or should I be putting vegetables in my smoothie you know so I'm curious about constipation as a Target yeah for intervention that then opens up a bunch of other discussions because there are these certain nodes in the in the mental health physical health space that when someone like we talk a lot deliberate cold exposure do I think it's magic no but I think that if someone's getting themselves into a cold shower once a day it opens up a number of questions about themselves and reveals a number of things to themselves like how do I buffer stress yeah what sorts of levels of control do I actually have and on and on so perhaps not the best example but um some of us hate cold exposure right which is we have we have like a gene that makes us stress out like you wouldn't believe C exposure which I would argue makes it um very likely that even 10 seconds of cold exposure gets you the effect that you want as opposed to someone who adores cold exposure like a penguin needs a lot more cold exposure for it to have the the Adaptive response anyway that's my way of of guming through that uh quite you're you're you're quite correct um so so let's answer this question constipation issue yeah so this is how you're changing the way I think about this so you're asking okay instead of looking at constipation as a constellation of symptoms what about if you just used it on its own sort of a um a key indicator or signal of dysfunction with pine Network or maybe something broader and I think that's right so it makes me think of a few things it makes me you're also changing this book that I'm writing on autoimmunity and Trauma so thank you for that so women experience more trauma than men this is well established if you look at the ace studies that were done by the CDC and Kaiser in 1998 we know that men for the most part middle-aged men have about um about 50% of them experience significant trauma as defined by the ace questionnaire women are at 60% and that's pretty durable since 1998 so women have more they have different forms of abuse much more likely to have sexual abuse they have a different HPA response than men men their perceived stress tends to be higher and I'm generalizing for a population so I note you know in Precision medicine we don't do that we do medicine for the indiv individual not the population not medicine for the average and so if you look at the physiology of a female I think that um constipation and that need to like control and restrain and hold things in you know tighten the anal sphincter I think that's part of the physiology so I'm veering away from the science but I do think that it is a really important signal to pay a lot of attention to now you also asked about microbiome testing should we do that or do you yeah well I have one I have a couple more questions about constipation I never thought I'd ask this many questions about constipation but now I'm fascinated by the way also this morning I taught medical students at Stanford about the fact that we are basically a series of tubes so you talked about the the anal sphincter we are a set of sphincters from one end to the other I mean we are tubes nervous system being one of those tubes and and I think in eastern medicine they talk about the various locks between those tubes and Chambers and it's not without coincidence there's some real wisdom there of course wait did you just talk about energetic Anatomy uh more or less I didn't say the word chakras but uh I might in passing it's the bondas the bondas right are the are the are the the the sphincters right yes that's right uh thank you for for that the um so what defines constipation I mean in other words let's let's think about that healthy rather than thinking about the unhealthy let's how many bowel movements should um a woman or a man have per day assuming this is where it gets tricky because some people are doing time restricted feeding some people are eating more some people eating more fiber more bulk larger meal at the end of the day larger at the beginning of the day we will never um be able to sort out all those variables but on average um how many bowel movements and is timing during the day for bowel movements at all uh informative well works for you um well when I'm asleep um generally I don't want a bowel movement so I'm going to be like most people right well sleep is primary for you right exactly um I'm I always assumed that morning time was a was a healthy time for B movements um and I think almost everybody babies included recognize the feeling of being lighter and more energetic when they've evacuated their colon totally um in fact so much so that I'm I'm obsessed with jungian and fian psychology that the first thing we learn when we come into this world right is that we want something we we feel some sort of autonomic arousal stress whether or not it's food or warmth or the need to have a bowel movement one of the first things that parents learn is how to recognize that not by the odor coming from the diaper but by the look on the baby's face or their agitation agitation signals the need for some sort of relief right temperature relief food relief um evacuating the bowel relief so my understanding is that as autonomic arousal increases in the early part of the day ideally after a good night's sleep that bowel movements become more likely unless that arousal becomes so great that then people feel so quote unquote locked up right um because of the the balance of the autonomic uh features so early day I'm guessing and again in the second half of the day and here I'm totally guessing um and certainly not having to wake in the middle of the night um yeah those are my best guesses that's great so I would agree with that when I was at Harvard Medical School in UCSF or residency I was taught that constipation is having a bell movement less frequently than one every once every three days sorry I don't think I've ever laughed out loud on this podcast as a consequence of of uh textbook medical knowledge are you kidding me is that ridiculous well that sounds like and and here pun intended that sounds like the uh the conclusion of some very um cons emotionally and and and and in other ways con ated individuals and again this might seem like an odd conversation but the the discussion around constipation is is present in psychological literature yes because of this relationship to the autonomic system well it's a metaphor in literature it's crucial so you you spoke to a number of different threads that I think are important here so that's the definition that I learned and I was I heard that and I was like hell no that doesn't work for me doesn't work for anyone I know and I spent a lot of time time especially in medical school and in my internship where you rotate on medicine disimpacting women like older women who come in who haven't had a bowel movement in a month whoa and that let me tell you that is not nice for anybody well believe me I I became a scientist and not a physician for a number of reasons that's one both positive and negative that's one of them yeah so my definition of constipation as a western mostly White girl is that if you're not having a bowel movement every single morning and you have a feeling of complete evacuation anything less than that is constipation so that's how I Define it if you're in India and you're eating food that's got a fair amount of microbes in it it's less you know sanitary I'm using that word um as carefully as I can generally they have about movement after every meal but they've got a different microbiome they're exposed to different microbes here in the US I would say one day you also spoke to something very important which is the balance between the parasympathetic nervous system rest and digest and poop versus the sympathetic nervous system kind of the on button you know fight flight freeze spawn so I think for those of us who've got issues with autonomic balance it can lead to constipation and I like that constipation could be pulled out and kind of RIT larger as an important signal what sorts of tools do you recommend people use to um relieve constipation um in eating more fiber sounds like reducing stress is going to be a huge one yes what are your favorite stress reduction tools um I like to divide these into um realtime tools so big proponent of like physiological s real time you know these sorts of things but um things that can really lower the Baseline on stress overall to facilitate constipation and other other um broad indicators of health so I'm not a fan of lowering stress I'm a fan of lowering perceived stress and I think the distinction is really important I learned when I was in my 30s that I was a massive stress case and I didn't know it it was just sort of I think I through residency through working 120 hours a week I just was so accustomed and sort of um that was 120 not under 20 folks yeah not unusual in in medicine well they they've changed training so that you work no more than 80 hours a week now but that was before my time so I became accustomed to a massive amount of cortisol massive and I would say I've spent the past 20 years really working on perceived stress to find I think all of us need an all a cart menu of what is most effective so what works for me now at my age is different than you know the the TM I did as a college student trans Dental meditation it's different than the I became a certified yoga teacher when I was in my 30s that is very effective for a lot of people it wasn't enough for my Matrix I do holotropic breath work um I didn't read it but I saw that she just had a paper in cell on your sign and um it kind of it made me think like teach me how to sigh teach teach me how to sigh like can you say a little bit about that like how do you do it yeah very briefly that study was we we wanted to find a minimal effective dose intervention yeah I just wanted yeah so five minutes a day we need to figure out what people would do every day yeah and we were monitoring subjective mood Etc but also Biometrics remotely so it's kind of a nice study which Biometrics HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep cortisol uh I wish um so this was done during the pandemic more than 100 subjects the advantage was that we got data 24 hours a day because they're pinging us in their data uh wearing 24 yeah nice so that was nice resting heart rate um subjective mood we would get in touch with them daily so when people were swapped between groups like any good study but five minutes a day of sort of standard if you will forgive me meditations so just sitting no instructions about how to breathe just focusing on um closing their eyes and focusing on focusing yep um another group did box breathing y inhale hold exhale hold for equal durations the duration of each of those inhales and holds was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance so somewhere between 3 and 8 seconds depending on how well they regulate carbon dioxide another group did cyclic sighing so this would be double inhale through the nose so big inhale through the nose followed by it to lungs empty exhale that second inhale after the first big lung inhale through the nose is really important because it makes sure that all the collapsed avoli the lungs totally snap open and then the exhale you offload a lot of carbon dioxide that's very similar to holotropic breath work not yes not not um not unlike holotropic breath work little bit pranayama is um but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active um and then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation which is a lot like Tumo AKA Wim hofish breathing different than Wim Hoff breathing so this would be so very active inhales and exhales every 25 Cycles of inhale exhale that would be one cycle long exhale hold lungs empty 15 to 30 seconds then repeat for about five minutes everyone did that for five minutes and what we found was that the cyclic sighing led to the greatest improvements in mood Around the Clock not just around the the practice or during the practice as well as lowered resting heart rate improvements in sleep Etc and you got to publish in cell we were very fortunate I I think um the the thankfully the reviewers and editors understood that these minimal intervention things uh hopefully are going to be of use to people so so useful to people I mean how often do you read a paper like that that could offer a behavior change that is so easy to implement I mean I love that question thank you so what about did you tell them not to drink because alcohol has such a huge effect on H yeah so in this case we didn't tell them to alter anything else about their behavior hoping it background kind of across the same Al yes and some were Stanford students others were from the general population any Frat Boys we drinking heavily probably not well during the pandemic I think alcohol intake went way way up across the board um I mean is an if I had a magic wand I would I would ask that people either not drink or drink two drinks per week maximum at least that's my understanding of the literature um are you familiar with the whoop data with alcohol no but we have a collaboration with whoop through that paper um and it certainly disrupts patterns of nighttime sleep in particular my understanding that first phase of sleep that's related to the massive growth hormone release that you we all really need and want in their measure growth hormone we did not no the second iteration of the study will certainly include free cortisol by saliva hormone panels well I'm beginning to think that we should also um be asking people how often they're going to the bathroom in what time of day yes I mean this thing around constipation is uh is super interesting and I think that plus um BL blood markers and then I'm I'm very excited to learn that um that urine contains additional markers that could be informative so yeah it was a it was a fun study uh not easy study to do with that number of of subjects um takes a lot of training for your research assistance yeah it was a big group it was nine people in our group and three clinicians and a lot of lot of phone calls and a lot of back and forth but you know and thank you to the subjects who served as the uh the real life guinea pigs so yeah I think that stress you know people's I think people are starting to appreciate that there are ways that they can relieve their stress that that don't all only fall under the categories of vacation right and meditation but I want to say that meditation is obviously a wonderful tool um it's just it's a it's a tool not unlike any other tool that is great for some people and less great for others well certainly it's a great tool and it's got such a scientific basis behind it but there's so many things on this allart menu sex orgasm um connect ction feeling heard and seen and loved um yeah let's talk about that you know you mentioned earlier that all these stress factors you you said patriarchy right but I think what if I may um at risk of uh of just strengthening that uh statement I I mean that that to me it's is signaling a bunch of other factors around as you said like keeping keeping things in um what do you think explains let's talk about that because I think that that's likely to have raised a certain flag in people's minds like what exactly is she talking about are you talking about less opportunity are you talking about less opportunity to um to vocalize are you talking about less opportunity to vocalize and be heard I mean I realize that there are an infinite number of variables but given that it sounds like a a really strong input to the system uh what I mean by that is that psychology is influencing biology and you're saying that that these uh that these po power Dynamics structures and Dynamics are impacting I'd love let's hear your thoughts on that because uh I I hate to let a flag like that go by without fleshing it out and let never waste a good flag well and let's preface it by by just saying that like people will have different opinions on this and that's and I think that's healthy and and like with the discussion about constipation let's talk about what people aren't willing to talk about when it comes to health love it so we might need to talk about patriarchy on part two but I'll give you some material that I've been working with I started I did not even understand the existence of patriarchy until I was a bio-engineering undergraduate at MIT I should mention which has always had a bit of a of a male um a skewed male in terms of faulty numbers well my my that's true at most universities true well my postto adviser was the late Ben Baris who was a female toale transition transgender first transgender member of the National Academy of Sciences one of my closest friends unfortunately died of of pancreatic cancer we were very very close they're actually making a documentary about Ben but Ben this is interesting Ben went to MIT because he wanted to be around a lot of men yeah that's a lesser known fact but then he was a very strong advocate for women he went as Barbara when he was Barbara and um by the way he's given me permission to share all this prior to his death I recorded a lot of conversations with Ben um I only ever knew him as Ben by the way but when he was at MIT he was identified female and he later talked about the intense um suppression oppression literally is how he described it um especially given that he was performing so well yes so you just defined patriarchy you did it yourself a couple things when I was in bioengineering I took a women's studies class and it was all about teaching under graduates about the existence of patriarchy which I would Define maybe at its simplest as power over I'm not saying men are patriarchy I'm saying something very different which is power over let me correct one thing that you said I didn't go to MIT as an undergraduate so I'm from I was in Alaska and I went to the University of Washington for bioengineering in Seattle in Seattle okay I dropped out of a graduate program in bioengineering to go to the Harvard MIT program for Health Sciences and technology in Boston thanks for that clarification University of Washington also wonderful place I have many many many many many wonderful close colleagues there it's an incredible place especially for vision science it's especially good for engineering bioengineering but um yeah so my my MD is jointly between MIT and Harvard and it's the oldest maybe largest although Harvard says this a lot program for biomedical engineers and uh MD phds physician scientist training program great thanks for that clarification I'm going to blame the internet for this one I am I think we need to send our our Wikipedia editors out I I think LinkedIn is correct okay great well w wikipedia uh editors note get out there and make the make the correction now you you heard it um so stress that is what you're really talking about is systemic stress in the body as a concept as a consequence excuse me of systemic stress of environment that's right but there's you know there's particular forms of it I would say this also relates to White Privilege it relates to uh racism and when you look at you know kind of the way that systems including my beloved MIT the way that they're set up is that might Mak makes right and generally the people that are the strongest you know big men strong men they're the ones who tend to be the most successful so for people who are bipo for people who don't have white privilege for women it's a different experience and so I'm using patriarchy as kind of a umbrella here but it connects to many other things I'd like to take AEF brief break and thank our sponsor insid tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that you get data back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with those data inside tracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional behavioral maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors hormones lipids and other things that impact your immediate and long-term Health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can visit insid tracker.com huberman and get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans that insidetracker docomond to get 20% off I want to use this as an opportunity to a keep this in mind as we turn to a question that I didn't uh close the hatch on earlier and it's my fault which is I'm now clear on the fact that a woman in her late teens early 20s ought to know something about her testosterone estrogen thyroid cortisol levels should start at least thinking about her microbiome should be thinking about how how many bowel movements and the timing of those bowel movements per day really and I'm assuming that what I just described is also true for women in their 20s 30s 40s 50s on up to hundreds is that correct that's correct but I would say that there [Music] are differential opportunities by decade so I'm glad she circled it back to teenagers and testosterone because I think if you know for instance in your teenage years that you have high androgens and that you've got this potential phenotype way into the future that you may not even notice I mean maybe you notice you've got a few extra hairs on your chin or something if you know that your testosterone is elevated or some other Androgen it might change the Arc of how you take care of yourself so I think that could be very helpful in your teenage years in your 20s for people who are a stress case like me so age 27 on the words at UCSF if I had known that I was such a high cortisol person I think I would have done things differently I would have changed my behavior and I don't know because I didn't base case these but your testosterone can decline starting in your 20s kind of depending on how much stress your Matrix is under so for women that can start as early as 28 usually you're testosterone declines by about 1% per year what level of testosterone do you like to see in a woman once she's sort of post let's say after age 25 what kind of range is healthy I know what the reference range is only because I know one could look it up I don't know it off the top of my head admittedly but what what's a kind of a nice reference point there so the way I tend to describe this on podcast is the top half of the normal range great so that I think is a good benchmark you know for PCOS generally it's much higher than that you know I've seen patients with PCOS where their total testosterone is 100 to 200 do they always have peripheral manifestations of that a little bit of hair the the skin plaques I've heard about you know so dark and skin plaque regular periods regular periods is that um you know I I get a lot of questions about PCOS yeah um and you're the first person we've had on this podcast that's really qualified to talk about PCOS in a real way um so here we're talking about too many androgens cysts on the ovary irregular ovarian me uh excuse me I keep saying that ovulatory menstrual cycle um what are some other indicators and do you recommend that women start taking Androgen blockers or or I mean how do seems to be a lot of PCOS out there I'm hearing about it a lot so glad you asked about this so PCOS is one of those really poorly understood conditions that gets it kind of flows flies below the radar until a woman wants to get pregnant or she's got some other issue that drives her to a physician the problem is that it is a syndrome right so polycystic ovary syndrome sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome and syndromes don't necessarily fit together into a really clear diagnostic criteria so in this instance there are three different criteria that we look for so cists on the ovaries having um clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism so that could be heroism acne other things and then usually irregular periods and the way that that's defined at least by the uh latest criteria is having a period every 35 days or less so typical cycle length 28 days 35 days you know you're skipping a period here and there so those are the those are the criteria that we use to diagnose PCOS there are about four different systems out there in the literature for diagnosing PCOS which is where it starts to get confusing so there's some women who have nosis on their ovaries but they've got heroism and they've got irregular periods could you define ha sism her sism is increased hair growth usually in places that you don't want it so for women it can be you know kind of male pattern they might notice it on their breasts on their chest um um and then there's of course a a familial quality to that like I was just looking at a paper last night looking at ises and how much heroism they have and whether this is related to CAG repeats on the Androgen receptor do they get um not Israelis but um do women who um who might have PCOS experience um endogenic alopecia so hair loss that sort of of the quote unquote male pattern baldness of course it's Androgen pattern baldness as opposed to male we're talking about testosterone DHD related sometimes you know this is where I'm going to invoke clinical experience rather than uh what I've seen in the literature women definitely can have some androgenic um alpia I tend to see it later in life but this is an important point because we think of PCOS as you know I was just talking about it in teenage years like wouldn't it be nice to know that you have this phenotype and you're at risk for all the things that people are at risk for and we haven't talked about glucose and ins yet we should what we know is that pcus is not just a problem in terms of irregular periods and then difficulty getting pregnant so those are mostly problems in your 20s 30s early 40s but it is a massive risk factor for cardom metabolic disease as you get older so many people tend to pigeon hole PCS is a problem of reproductive age we have to be thinking of it over the entire female life cycle and I would say it's even more important to consider it over the age of 50 you know average age of menopause is 51 to 52 because we know that that elevated testosterone the high androgens are probably the greatest cardio metabolic driver of disease for women with PCS wow now one other thing I want to mention and I still have my notes that we're going to talk about microbiome testing because that's such a fun subject what I was taught to do again saying this with so much love for the people who have taught me how to do medicine what I was taught to do is that if you have a woman with PCOS you make the diagnosis you measure her testosterone you see if she has acne blah blah blah you asked that woman one question do you want to get pregnant or not so then you have these women with PCS who get started on a birth control pill if they don't want to get pregnant if they want get pregnant then you help them get pregnant by addressing some of these PCS issues like maybe you give them Clomid or you do something to make them ovulate more frequently that is the way that most conventional medicine approaches this and it does women at gigantic disservice so one of the things I'm speaking into is the gender gap that exists so I my feeling is that the research money that goes into women's health is abysmal compared to what goes into Men's Health really and I think that's changing but there's also a huge lack of awareness of sex and gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials and other experiments well that's absolutely true I mean I sit on I've sat on NIH review panels for more than a decade now I'm a regular standing member which is only to say that I see the research as it's being proposed yes and now it's required no Grant will get funded without sex as a biological variable and here I'm I'm by the way folks this is sex biological sex the noun not sex the verb both are super interesting obviously but um when we say sex as a biological variable meaning even even if it's a study on mice where did that start though that didn't start that long ago it must have been I think we can thank I don't want to misattribute here I think we can thank Francis Collins for insisting on this amen Francis and Bernardine hey Bernardine Healey has done so much to help us but you know she made the Women's Health Initiative which I hope we'll get to which just a hot mess like so confusing the data that came out of that and these trials are long and so the data are only now starting to emerge so just to be clear I mean I have a a question that I don't think is going to take us off track but this is I'm going to posee this question as a hypothesis because I think it's likely to be uh a little bit of a of a not a barbed wire question but maybe like a prickly question when people first hear it but it's posed as a hypothesis you you mentioned some of the psychosocial stress issues based on at the organiz ational level institutional level societal level maybe right down to the family and and just life that are biasing Health outcomes for the worse in female populations okay you refer to as the patriarchy I'm just trying to put make sure that we're both talking about the same thing and that's non-exhaustive I realize that's just a subset of the issues I'm also hearing there's a lot more PCOS which is hyper androgenization of the ovary in there we're talking about you mentioned you know excess testosterone which females naturally have more testosterone than they do estrogen anyway but we're talking about elevated levels here's a hypothesis one hypothesis would be that the increased androgens and the P PCOS are a consequence of the psychosocial conditions that are I don't want to say forcing but are biasing the need for females to um think behav react act in certain ways to survive let alone Thrive is that a I don't say this for any kind of political correctness hypothesis this is a in my this would be a fun interesting and I think important study to run right depending on stress and the conditions the specific type of stress do females underproduce or overproduce androgens or is it a neutral effect does that make make sense I love this question so let me just paraphrase the last part of it to make sure I got it it sounds like what you're asking is could PCOS or at least some phenotypes of PCOS be a response to what I'm calling patriarchy and then you had a second part to it which is do healthy women like what is their production of testosterone like is that right yes and and with the acknowledgement I mean you're the expert here um you're the physician clinician and expert in hormones and I'm not but with the understanding that absolute levels of hormones are interesting but perhaps not as interesting as the ratios of testosterone to estrogen so when we're talking about excess testosterone we're really not talking about oh women making a lot of testosterone because frankly they already make a lot like then most people weren't aware of that I wasn't aware that women make more testosterone than estrogen right and so it's not saying that testosterone in women is bad or is always a reaction to the environment yes but when it becomes um super physiological or hyper elevated is I could imagine all sorts of social conditions that would create that um so in males and females but here we're talking about PCOS and females in particular so I'd love for you to speculate um should we run the study we should totally run the study because I don't know the answer I suspect that you're on to something it may not explain all of the women with PCOS because as I metion there's a lot of different phenotypes but I think it could explain a significant portion and you know you're almost you're saying if we look at the gene environment interface this environmental influence of having being someone who's got power over you if if pcus was a response to that the way that we treat it would be completely different so on the one hand I want to be careful not to dismiss the suffering and experience of women with PCOS I've got a lot of women with PCOS in my family and it is there's so much pain and suffering you know especially if you want to have a baby and you try for years and you just can't ovulate on the other hand I read a paper recently and maybe we could site this that compares the phenotype of a woman with pcus to a man who is hypoandrogenic and I think that's a really interesting way to look at this because the thread we haven't talked about with PCOS is the the role of insulin and glucose so for some of the phenotypes of PCOS the problem is hyper insulin emia High insulin in the blood is driving those Thea cells in the ovaries to overproduce testosterone these women are insulin sensitive so more insulin is being cranked out and the cells in the ovary are therefore making more Androgen you don't like to say insulin resistant oh I I can uh I don't have a problem saying resistance like the way I'm just I'm just a little bit outside the lane lines of my expertise so I I was trying to use it what what is the correct gnom en clature so that we can make sure everyone well what I like about insulin insensitive the way that you just said it is that I think that offers people a way in and I love to do that in terms of messaging insulin resistance starts to lose people cuz they don't really get what that means at a receptor level I think I say insulin insensitive because when people hear insulin sensitive it almost sounds like a bad thing but that's actually what you want so I think I think that's how I defaulted to insulin insens what your insulin I don't know what I'm do for a blood test yes you are I'm doe for a blood test um I had blood work done about eight months um sure that'd be great I I uh I'm always um experimenting with different supplements and different behavioral regimens and I've kept charts since I was 19 oh like my patient I been sort of Obsessed by this and I would say everybody if you can afford it and at the time actually I had to save up Insurance wouldn't cover it um get some basic blood work done so that you have a reference point do it as soon as possible because even you know the we've been talking about these women over the life cycle I wish I knew what my insulin was when I was a teenager I wish I wish I knew what my fasting insulin was I really wish I knew my postprandial insulin like in my teenage years in my 20s in my 30s well I knew it in my 30s starting at 35 are you a fan of continuous glucose monitors the hugest most gigantic fan of cgms I've never seen any tool that I've ever used in medicine change Behavior the way that cgms do wow why do you think they are so effective at changing Behavior I've tried one and I really liked it I learned that in the sauna my insulin or my blood glucose goes up probably by a bit of dehydration I learn what kind of foods work for me which don't um I I thought it was fascinating I learned how every Behavior you could possibly imagine use your imagination impacts blood glucose totally fascinating to me including how a two wake wake-ups during the middle of the night versus one versus none impacted blood glucose the next morning fascinating for a data junkie like me it was like I was in heaven um why do you think they are so effective in changing behavior is it because of that that people can see that real time control like scan in and like oh that's the that's the sandwich I think it's many things I think it's generally the Enchantment of learning about your own chemistry and I love that and I think for me what I've seen you know I feel like doctors are basically marketers like the sacred marketing like our job as a physician is to convince people to do something that we think is good for them based on the best science but we can't just say here why don't you fill this prescription for a CGM you have to Market it you have to say I think this completely changes the way that you approach your pre-diabetes I think this could dramatically affect your risk of Alzheimer's disease that you're so worried about that your mother has so our job as Physicians is to be that sacred marketer so cgms are one of my tools that I think are so crucial so enchantment number two yeah it's the real- time effect so if you go get your glucose and Insulin measured or maybe you do like a 2hour glucose challenge test where you look at glucose and Insulin at the fasting Point 1 hour later 2 hours later or more frequently that does not have the same kind of behavior effect as having continuous data where you can say okay I drove to see you Andrew from my place in Berkeley and it was stressful it was torrentially raining and I know my glucose was elevated like I think really understanding what the the mediators are of your glucose control is essential now that said it's also kind of a later effect I mean I'd rather know your insulin and we know from uh the white head White Hall study that insulin especially postprandial insulin fasting insulin too can change years and years before you get a change in glucose so um that's more for pre-diabetes and diabetes so I think those are the main reasons why I think it's such an important tool third thing is it democratizes data which you do too I mean incredible how you do that with your podcast but I think one of the most hopeful and exciting things that I'm seeing right now in the health space is that we're going from this patriarchal relationship where doctors hold the power and are The Gatekeepers of data to patients and clients having having much more access to that enchantment about their own chemistry and their own biology so to me that is so exciting like for me to be able to I've got you know probably 100 patients that are in a data stream with me where we're looking at their glucose and I can I mean I'm on spaical so I'm not doing this so much anymore but I can call a patient be like why is your glucose so high like what did you do oh it was my birthday I had a piece of birthday cake like that kind of collaboration that also is teaching the patient to be their own clinician to me that is a loop of benevolence and integrity that I think is essential to creating Health we've got a disease care system we need the democratization of data to become a health-based system Amen to that a million times over we share that uh sentiment can tell it at a deep level I I think the pandemic actually assisted in well it harmed many things but it assisted in people's understanding that um no magic fery nor the government nor any anyone was going to arrive at their door with a kit of things to make them healthy that provide sunlight movement sleep and all the various aspects of nutrition no nothing nothing that it everyone has to have access to first and foremost and then Implement those things as best they can speaking of which and kind of circling back to this idea of people in their late teens 20s 30s and onward if you had a magic wand and you could give like two or three don'ts or to make it personal if you could go back in time and erase certain behaviors what would the the don'ts category be um you can tell us more than two or three um but if the goal is to maximize vitality and Longevity and those are not always uh parallel to one another certainly not the same thing sometimes orthogonal but let's just say fertility being a proxy for vitality and Longevity I think people will sometimes forget this that fertility isn't just about people who want to conceive children it's also it's a it can serve as a proxy for vitality and Longevity so uh what would you like to see patients let's focus first on female patients but um if it extends to male patients as well what would you like to see them not do yeah or do far less of I really like that so I would say a few things I'll just headline them and then we can go into detail number one sleep I do want to diverge from you a little bit on some things but sleep is probably not one of them oh well feel free I mean you're the one that worked 100 you're the one that worked 120 hours a week sleeping much then's I can't imagine unless unless you lived in a different reality than I do um uh you and there are times in my career where I was pulling all nighters and sleep deprived there just it I don't recommend it but I did it hope you don't do that anymore no longer if I can avoid it but there were years many years where it was like all right here we go and I I'm quite um Adept at it for one cycle yeah but two nights I kind of start to fall fall apart totally yeah so I would say sleep alcohol High perceived stress and I'd love to talk about maybe um the data on telr and what we know so you'd like to see people get enough sleep so don't don't just yeah not all of these are concordant so um not enough sleep too much alcohol too much perceived stress eating the wrong Foods toxic relationships and isolation and then number six um not moving enough or not moving and exercising in a way that really fits with your body we start with that one actually cuz it's such a and then work backward um uh that's interesting I I I think nowadays people appreciate the need for quote unquote cardio I know that the the exercise physiologists cringe and and dissolve into a puddle of Tears when I say that but getting the heart rate up over some period of time longer than 10 minutes in order to generate cardiovascular health circulation so and resistance training of some kind maybe flexibility what what do you mean by Body phenotype or and exercise I'll speak from personal experience so what I did through I mean I gave up my 20s to medicine and during that time I occasionally got to the gym you know at UCSF on pralis you could go to the gym and then as soon as your beer went off you're back into the hospital but I didn't exercise much I had um do you remember Nordic tracks I had a Nordic Track in my house and that was that was like it what I believe because for me the primary outcome that I'm interested in is cardiometabolic health so when it comes to exercise what I really feel if we're going to be at a population level I feel that about a third cardio 2/3 resistance training is based on my synthesis of the literature the best combination and I think there's you know as you described with your s um study I think there's a minimal effective dose which for a population is about 150 minutes I think most of us need a lot more than that per per week per week but I think you know for me because I have a phenotype that produces a lot of insulin kind of depending on how I'm on my game I have a lot of glucose so I have to exercise a lot more to dispose that glucose so I think you then have to move from medicine for the population or prescriptions for the population to what works for the individual I think that recommendation is fantastic um I think resistance training well let me put it this way I'm neither a trainer nor a physician but I've seen in family members that were doing I wouldn't say a lot of cardio but just cardio that when they add resistance training everything in terms including their biomarkers um have improved dramatically yes is in particular for female members of my family well one of the one of the mediators that I think is important especially for people who do what I call chronic cardio which is what I did is cortisol so we know that um Runners especially marathon runners people who do a lot of cardio and don't do much resistance training they tend to have much High cortisol levels and you can buffer that with vitamin C vitamin C can decrease the effect but chronic cardio doesn't always serve people so quick personal example when I first started measuring hor panels in myself I went to my physician and I said I'm 35 I've had one kid I want to have another kid I've never been so exhausted in my life I just feel like I'm pushing a rock up the hill I've got this belly fat that I don't like and um I don't want to have sex with my husband so what do you think what could we do about this and he offered a birth control pill and an anti-depressant oh goodness so I left him and I went to the lab and I ran a hormone panel and my cortisol was three times what it should have been my insulin was in the 20s I was fasting my glucose was 105 my thyroid was mildly abnormal my progesterone was low and that set me on this course of realizing that what I was doing as physician taking care especially of women was not getting to some of these root causes that are so essential and I would say I had to start first with cortisol at that time I was running four miles three times a week four times a week that was just Rising my cortisol further so that was not the right exercise for me I needed more adaptive exercise I started doing Pilates more yoga that helped to lower my cortisol I mean it started me on you know changing the way I was managing perceived stress and it also changed my supplement regimen could we talk about that um what the moment you said lowering cortisol thought of the two supplements that come to mind are ashwagandha which I think can potently reduce cortisol but I've heard some recommendations about cycling it um and I've always wondered about time of day for ashwaganda intake because sort of quote unquote want cortisol elevated in the early part of the day yes and we know this uh we know you do not want cortisol peaking later in the day no you do not interferes with sleep interferes with sleep um and then the other supplement is riola rosacea do I am I pronouncing that correctly yeah so riola is very effective it's been shown in multiple randomized trials to lower cortisol so that could be very effective what sort of dose I've started taking it recently by the way and I made a huge mistake I like to make the mistakes first so then my audiences don't make them um as I was taking it I heard it was an adaptogen so I thought oh I'll take it before resistance training but of course you want the cortisol Peak during resistance training because that's going to set in motion the Adaptive response so I started taking it later in the day and it's really improved I would say my late day second half of the day cognition this is subjective to be fair I just feel like I'm in a more even plane of attention in the second half of the day so you're describing an NF1 experiment which is anec data it well it is not anecdotal so I was taught at Harvard Medical School that the hierarchy of evidence starts at the lowest with expert opinion you know case studies then you've got cohort studies then you've got um observational data that's prospective then you have randomized trial but the highest quality evidence of all is the n of one experiment where you serve as your own control so what you're describing with riola I would frame that as n of one experiment where you have a wash out period and you compare before and after and I'd like to measure some other metrics to see if there's an effect including your cortisol so rodial has been shown in multiple randomized trials to reduce cortisol the other thing that I think is super effective is phosph title searing PS for short fish oil also more modestly reduces cortisol ashwaganda is interesting so in my first book the hormone cure which I read by the way you did I did I was hoping that was the one you read I did I read it and it's spectacular and I thought going into it I had this like you know let's just call it what it was it's kind of male bias like is there going to be anything in here for me because uh I'm I don't have ovaries and you know is this going to be and it was IM mely informative um so thank you yeah I have very fond Recollections of the the walks I took listening to it and then I own the print version too so I like to switch back and forth so thank you for that it's a it's a superb book for anyone to read thank you I so appreciate that so in chapter 4 you may or may not remember that ashwagandha at least the time that I wrote that book ashwag ganda's data is not great but lack of proof is not proof against so with ashwag gandha most of the comes from thousands of years of using it in itic medicine and it's considered again not my science hat it's considered a double adaptogen so that it's potentially helpful when you are um a high cortisol phenotype like I was like I sometimes still am or low cortisol I haven't found that in my patients although I'll give you one exception so ashwaganda is mostly based on animal studies there's not as much human data but it is used a ton in Integrative Medicine the um there's one supplement that I found to be incredibly helpful for people who tend to have high cortisol at night and that's called a cortisol manager it's by integrative Therapeutics I don't have a second um supplement manufacturer that makes something similar it's their number one selling supplement because it's so effective is it a cocktail of several things it's a combination of phosph tile Serene and ashwaganda tell tell me more about tile Serene I I am familiar with it for it's been mentioned by some guests that were on the Tim Ferris podcast long ago for other reasons I think related to sleep yes um and maybe that's another reason why you like it um but before we move on from Rola is there a dosage of rodal or rosacea that you um so I would refer people to my book because the randomized trials and the doses that were used are in there so I can't remember with riola although I took it this morning to prepare to be with you yeah we can look it up remember with phos sering I take that regularly so 400 to 800 m is the typical dose for PS and what's interesting is that in the randomized trials that were done 400 milligrams was more effective than 800 milligrams interesting I've found that for several supplements that the lower dose was more effective yes um yeah I won't it doesn't matter what those were and so when you say PS you were referring to by the way folks not PCOS just cuz scien and clinicians are familiar with and Military very familiar with acronyms phospha tidal serin PS so 400 800 milligram 400 being more effective taken later in the day or early day does it matter it depends on when your cortisol is high so for me I tend to you know what's the pattern for cortisol typically it rises to its peak 30 to 60 minutes after you get up then it has this gradual kind of asmic decline until you go to bed so if you're someone like me who Peaks like way crazy high I don't do that anymore but that's what I used to do I need a phosph Serene in the morning for people who are high at night who have what's known as a a flat cortisol pattern or a inverted pattern you want to take it at night and the flat pattern just quick sidebar is that that's associated with a number of conditions that most mainstream Physicians don't know about so a flat pattern where it's in the morning and it's high at night is associated with anxiety depression uh decreased survival from breast cancer that was studied at Stanford by David Spiegel that he was my um coll close even collaborator even uh on the breath work study that we oh interesting yeah he's our associate chair of Psychiatry now a wonderful human being has has been a guest on this podcast and and I'm now fantasizing about a conversation that includes uh a panel of of of uh Incredible Minds like you and David from the clinical side so in any case um yeah the late shifted cortisol not good not good not good and it seems to have the worst immune Downstream issues of any of the cortisol patterns so that's really important to know about because it then maps to things like um it's related to PTSD so that's the pattern we see like in vets who've got PTSD as well as others it maps to autoimmunity it maps to fibromyalgia I was told that one in 12 people um have our heterozygous so one mutant copy or hypermorphic for some some mutation in adrenal related Gene so congenital adrenal hyperplasia is that true and if so that means that one in 12 people walking around are cranking out far too much cortisol or not enough cortisol all or the quol system is already skewed in a direction that makes life more challenging at the levels we're talking about um did I hear that correctly because that one in 12 is not a small number it's not a small number it fits with what I see clinically I mean I want to see that data just to see um what does that mean and could you modulate it with environmental influences but it certainly fits with what I see you know I was taught once again in mainstream medicine that in terms of adrenal function it's very binary how most clinicians think about it you either have Addison's disease and you don't make enough cortisol or you've got Cushings or cushingoid pattern and you make too much cortisol and anything in the middle is normal and my experience is that hell no like there are those of us like me who make a lot of cortisol I don't have Cushings maybe I've got one of these I wouldn't call it a mutant Gene I would call it more of a um vulnerable Gene so maybe I have one of those maybe that's part of the reason why I make you know two to three times what I should be I'm aware of certain groups of individuals from within the military sector that um have there's a more frequent occurrence of some mutation in C C congenital adrenal hypertension not necessarily two copies which will if people look that up they're going to go oh wow there's all these phenotypes and um but sort of hypomorphic type thing so you know less than or too much cortisol and they are very good at staying up multiple days per night right uh multiple nights in series so they can pull all nighters very easily they can push harder when most people would quit and everyone thinks well that's a great phenotype to have but guess what it's because they hyper produce cortisol yep and um so that's interesting and I think if we were to panel medical students and graduate students and you were to look at you know who's pulling excessive long hours who's stressed out a lot even outside of Academia and medicine and pushing pushing pushing really hard I think the ability to push and not crash we think of it as adaptive but in some sense it's maladaptive over a series of years which is sort what were you described earlier yeah it's such a good point because you know you in some ways you'd want to select for that in certain professions like in the military like in medicine um but I would wonder for those folks about the downstream consequences of producing so much cortisol no it's got to be detrimental for their health in the long run and and you see that but even the data shows that if you're someone like me who makes a lot of cortisol higher rates of depression like 50% of people with major depression have high cortisol levels higher rates of suicide um much more metabolic dysfunction we know that trauma as an example maps to an increased risk of glucose metabolism issues and certainly High cortisol does that because it's one of the jobs of cortisol is to manage glucose and it's it kind of sets you up for um this one number five which is toxic relationships you know someone who hyper produces cortisol it's hard to live with someone like that it's also I would say people that have this um let's just call it biological resilience um it's not always adaptive because you can stay in in bad circumstances longer the ability to to crash provided it's not suicide or life life destroying or you know long Arc of of of pause and the requirement to you know take two years off from work or school or something um the ability to keep pressing on is is a double-edged sword let's put it that way um I want to make sure in staying within this conversation uh because you mentioned fos serin we talked about Rola Rosa as we talked a bit about ashwagandha you've also talked about Omega-3s and fish oil in particular I'd love to know your favorite sources of these I think nowadays there's more General acceptance that getting these essential fatty acids is important do you have a threshold level of sort of grams I I've encouraged uh um podcast listeners to consider depending on what they're eating to try and get a gram of EPA or more per day does that seem excessive um and what are the real data on epas because then the uh cardiovascular experts always hit back and say oh no you know it's not good for cardiovascular health and then you go well it's better than anti-depressants and other studies and they go no so I feel like if you really want to make your life difficult if you want to raise your cortisol you go on Twitter and you say something positive about Omega-3s of fish oil and um and you learn a lot um what are your thoughts on Omega-3s I take a lot of them I've always been a big fan yeah so this is where I personalize I think some people need more than others and what I do is I measure your level so this gets back to nutritional testing so for you I would suggest an Omega Quant or one of my favorite cardom metabolic panels is to do a Cleveland heart lab so I think they they give me the most reliable information not just for lipids and subclasses and you know NMR fractionation but it also gives me an insulin resistance score it gives me um levels of Omega-3s great we'll provide links to these different sites so people but one quick thing about that the whole story is not Omega-3s in taking fish oil so the work of Charley Siran at the Brigham is showing that the way that we resolve inflammation our understanding of it is really I think in the learning to crawl stage and so if you look at the omega-3 6 pathway in the body fish oils can help you know kind of push the reactions in a particular direction but typically they're not enough for the resolution of inflammation now what most people do including my NBA players is they pop an ibuprofen or something like that when they've got inflammation that's got lots of other side effects that are not so good for you and we know in terms of the resolution of inflammation that taking something like ibuprofen reduces the amplitude of inflammation by by about 50% but then it potentially blocks the complete resolution of inflammation so there's these new supplements that you may have heard of called specialized Pro resolving mediators there's a lot of different supplement companies that make them and that combined with fish oil seems to be the best combination and what I do for athletes who've got you know kind of the normal aches and pains of the training load they have is all combine a little aspirin small dose just like um 81 Mig or two of those baby aspirin together with fish oil plus specialized Pro resolving mediators and there's some that are NSF they're certified for sports but the the dose I would say with my patients some of them only need 1,000 milligrams your Gram that you mentioned for the population some of them need six gram together with spms so I think it has to be personalized how young um is it okay for people to start taking Omega-3s um for instance young women in their teens people in their 20s and their 30s young guys in their 20s and 30s should they take fish oil if just as a assuming they're not going to get anything tested I'm thinking about the college student who is really into biomarkers and that sort of thing we'll go do some of this um but many people won't but they want to do the right thing so they'll try and drink a little less hopefully hopefully they won't smoke or vape please please don't smoke or vape the idea that vaping is okay it's like we had a whole episode so bad so bad for everything we're talking about let's end that chap exactly so just you know avoid they hopefully they'll try and avoid those things hopefully they'll avoid hard drugs um hopefully they'll avoid getting any STI if they do they'll resolve them quickly hopefully yes um so but they might say oh well okay I'm willing to you know take some magnesium or take some phosph sering buffer my cortisol eat some vegetables um should they considering fish oil as a kind of a cross theboard in ulatory thing so I'd like to rank order these I would say fish oil yes I think a th milligrams as a general recommendation is good but I also have a food first philosophy so my preference would be that they're having salmon or some kind of Smash fish and they're getting that as the primary source of their Omega-3s and then the days that they don't have fish I recommend it probably twice a week that they take fish oil then I would put magnesium next since so many people are deficient then I'd probably put vitamin D what how many IU a vitamin D per day well you keep asking me this like for the the population yeah well for the let me put it this way for the LA for the lazy person or and this is an or not an and um or the person who um just doesn't have the finances to go get measured levels measured because you know our audience is a huge range we've got people who can have tons of disposable income that list in the spot we have people with no disposable income so a th000 to 2,000 International you but my you know what I do is I dose to a serum level that's between about 50 and 90 great and so I have a vitamin D receptor uh snip and so I need to take about 5,000 a day to get to what I need a lot of people don't need that and you know there's some supplements that I don't know if they need so you mentioned phosph tile sering for someone who's a college student and their cortisol is completely normal they're wasting their money on PS they don't need it they might need it later but they don't need it now I'd like to make sure that we Circle back to birth control in particular oral contraceptive birth control and we should touch on iuds perhaps a little bit more but what are your thoughts on S pure estrogen birth control this is what I learned when I was in college is that birth control is basically tonic estrogen so constantly taking estrogen estrogen women are taking estrogen so that they don't get the estrogen priming of progesterone you're not getting any ovulation and I've known women that have been taking oral Contra or that took oral contraception as like estrogen pills basically for 5 10 15 years are there long-term consequences of this as it relates to pregnancy PCOS menopause what if so what are some of those consequences um what are your concerns what do you like about oral contraceptive what do you dislike about them I like how balanced you asked that question so women who take oral contraceptives as long as you're describing like 10 years or longer we call those Olympic oral contraceptive users in terms of benefit I think that especially when they first came out and even now it gives women reproductive choice and That's essential as you may know our reproductive Choice has been declining recently so I'm a big fan in that regard and we've got a lot of data to show both the risks and also the benefits of it so I'll speak first into the benefits because uh I'm going to get on a soap box a little bit about the risks so we know that it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer so there's something about this idea of incessant ovulation that is not good for the female body so if you look at for instance women who are nuns who uh don't take oral contraceptives and they have a period every single month of their reproductive lives they have a greater risk of a brain cancer so if you look then at women who have uh several babies and they've got a period of time when they're pregnant that they're not ovulating and then they breastfeed for some period of time they have a lower risk of aaring cancer so oral Contra contraceptives help with reducing ovulation and reducing risk we know that if you take the oral contraceptive for about 5 years it reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 50% and that's significant because we're so poor at diagnosing ovarian cancer early there's really no method that's really effective we use ca125 and ultrasound screening especially in women who are at greater genetic risk but even that often we diagnose it you know in a later stage maybe just because that statement is going to highlight for a number of people um the question of what are some of the Sy earliest symptoms that people can recognize without a blood test so is ovarian cancer is it going to be pain so the problem is the symptoms are so vague and they're so non-specific one of the most common symptoms is bloating and we've already talked about constipation we've talked about how women have this longer track GI track and so bloating is a really common experience for most women you can have bulk symptoms you know feeling like your your lower belly is kind of pressed out so the way that we inform women in terms of watching for this is to get regular gynecologic exams um for women who are at high risk where they have for instance an ultrasound for some reason it shows a mass that we're concerned about there's a way to triage that in terms of what kind of evaluation that they need and that's a situation where you might get a blood test called a ca129 ca1 25 the um yeah the problem is the symptoms are so vague it could be it depends on how big the tumor is how much bulk you have what it's pressing on so if if um taking estrogen and thereby reducing the frequency of ovulation lowers the risk of ovarian cancer should women that are even women who are not sexually active so they're they're not actively trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant but if they're not sexually active then the probability of conceiving unless they go through some IUI or some other route is is very low as far as I know um that's what I was taught in high school anyway um would they be wise to suppress ovulation for periodically using hormone-based contraception just so that they can offset the risk of ovarian cancer that's a very rational question and I would say that's what mainstream medicine has had at its back to recommend oral contra cves not just for women who are seeking contraception but for acne for painful periods for really kind of the drop of a hat they're prescribing oral contraceptives that's what I was taught to do but there's so many consequences and I think the issue here is more about consent because in OBGYN and I started out as a board certified OBGYN and I now mostly see men but I was taught as an OBGYN to convince women to go on the oral contraceptive and I think a lot of that is pharmaceutical influence so maybe we could talk about the risks and why the answer is no to your question um as we do that could I just ask is the um the so-called ring the new it used to be called the NOA ring maybe that's a brand name but it when I was in college there was all this discussion about the ring all right by both men and women for reasons that don't belong on the podcast um use your imagination folks so um is the the ring obviously it's not oral it's not oral hormone contraception but it's hormone-based right the ring is releasing estrogen locally as opposed to taking it orally but would you would you slot it under what you're about to tell us in terms of the concerns so we have less data about the ring so the oral contraceptive is two hormones it's ethany estrad and it's a progestin so it's not the normal uh progesterone that your body makes your ovaries make and your adrenals make it is a synthetic form of progesterone and it is the same progestin similar same class that was shown to be dangerous and provocative in the women's health initiative so I'm not a fan of progestins I do not recommend them for any woman unless the consequence of not taking them is surgery or some other um you know unless it it gives them some freedom in some way so I don't like progestins the uh Nar ring is estrogen plus progestin but it's released transdermally through the vagina so given the the way that um it's delivered to the vagina the doses are lower than what's taken orally but in terms of some of the risks that I'm about to talk about we don't know about much of the data yeah we think that it's similar there's probably a spectrum of risk and the ne ring is a little more towards the middle than you know what I'm talking about with oral contraceptives okay are you ready for that yeah I'm ready for the risks okay so like with almost any pharmaceutical the oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients so magnesium there's certain vitamin BS that are depleted uh it also affects the microbiome that data is not as strong but there seems to be some effect and there's also an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease in autoimmune condition it increases inflammatory tone so the studies that I've seen increase one of the markers of inflammatory tone High sensitivity CRP by about 2 to 3x it seems to make the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis more rigid so that you can't kind of roll with the punches and wax and Wayne in terms of cortisol production the way that you can off the birth control pill it can affect thyroid function I'm thinking of the slide that I have that has like 10 problems associated with oral contraceptive but that's what I can remember right now that's very helpful and it makes me wonder whether or not if on the one hand oral contraceptives are protective in women against ovarian cancer but then they have these other issues yeah there's one another I want to mention please anytime you take oral estrogen it raises sex hormone B globulin and you've talked to other podcast guests about this Kyle I think sex hormone binding globulin I think of as a sponge that soaks up free estrogen and free testosterone so when you go on the birth control bill you raise your sex hormone binding globuline it soaks up especially free testosterone and for some women it's not a big deal they don't notice much of a difference but then there's a phenotype maybe related to CAG repeats on the Androgen receptor who are exquisitly sensitive to that decline in free testosterone so this then opens the portal of talking a little bit about testosterone and women so we've mentioned already that it's the most abundant biologically the most abundant hormone in the female system even though men make almost 10 times as much or even more than 10 times it is so important for women it is essential to so many things not just sex drive and muscle mass and seeing a response to resistance training but also confidence and agency and so those women who are so sensitive to their testosterone level they've got this high sex hormone Bing globulin their testosterone declines what they describe is vaginal dryness maybe a decline in sex drive but there's also this bigger issue related to confidence need agency even risk-taking from studies that we've done with MBA students that I think is a serious problem maybe the most important out of all of these things is that it can shrink the clitoris by up to 20% 20% and that includes the a regression of the of the nerves that innervate the the clitoris is that I mean that's a very good question as a neuroscientist yeah I would think uh used to teach uh the neural side of of reproductive Health we need to do a series on Sexual Health maybe you would co-host that with me sure I we could certainly use your expertise I think um yeah that's a dramatic that's a dramatic number yeah but then let's go back to the sacred marketing if I've got a woman that I think should not be on the birth control pill maybe she's taking it for acne or she's taking it because her periods were a little painful what I'm going to do is say let's leverage these other ways of making your period less painful let's take the message of your painful periods and figure out okay is it your inflammatory tone and we give you some fish oil and spms maybe a little aspirin when youve gotch your period like let's find some other ways to deal with it than to take the oral contraceptive which you have not received informed consent about because it can trick your by up to 20% now that usually convinces most people to the elevation in sex hormone binding globulin does not seem to go away when you come off the birth control pill to me that is the biggest problem problem with prescribing oral contraceptives now the data that we have is limited there's one woman who uh Claudia something something who looked at sex hormone binding globulin a year out from stopping the birth control pill and it was still elevated it wasn't as high as it was when they were on the pill but it was still elevated so your question about reversibility I don't know if we know the answer to that wow okay um that's yeah that's a significant statement and something that for consideration related to this although this might seem not related it is how early do you recommend that women go get their follicle number assessed in other words to get a size a sense of the size of the ovarian reserve and their amh levels U measured um I'm going to I'm an amateur Outsider as I say this but we have an episode on infertility where I just describe the ovulatory menstrual cycle yeah um and I'm not the best person to answer that yeah well we can I'm too far off from it okay well um I suppose then from taking the perspective of somebody who thinks about fertility in terms of at least congruent with vitality and Longevity would given that it's fairly non-invasive it's an ultrasound or a blood draw or amh or both is there any reason why a woman would not want to get her follicle number assessed or her amh levels assessed is there any reason why because I was shocked to learn that most women don't do this until they're hitting their late 30s or early 40s and they haven't conceived or they suddenly decide that they want to conceive and I thought why doesn't every doctor insist that their female patients get have their amh level addressed so that if they need to freeze eggs it's cost yeah so I think if you've got the disposible income to do it go for it it's not included in a standard blood panel no wow the only way women in my practice who've had amhs done and have looked at their follicle count are women who want to freeze their eggs or and that requires disposable income or they um are having trouble getting pregnant so they are in the reproductive Endocrinology system and they're getting an evaluation and then they're also um the women who have symptoms of early menopause so premature ovarian insufficiency which is before age 40 uh those are the women that I see getting attested and I think you're right that it should be offered more broadly it speaks to the democratization of data again and I think most women don't know that so you're doing a huge service I think to be speaking into this one other point related to that is that what I see in conventional medicine is that when a woman asks for a hormone panel and she's not trying to get pregnant she usually gets told that hormones vary too much it's a waste of money you don't need it or if you're feeling hormonal why don't you go on a birth control Bill unless she's trying to get pregnant if she's trying to get pregnant suddenly those same tests are very reliable and they get you know their their testosterone their free testosterone their thyroid pain they get their estrogen and progesterone maybe they get their cortisol they get their amh so there's a double standard between those who want to get pregnant and those who don't and that needs to end yeah I totally agree as I've learned more about um ovulatory cycle and amh and and the anal population of follicles all it's fascinating it just seems to me wow a relatively straightforward test one definitely invasive ultrasound but I don't consider that yeah not terribly invasive but invasive uh at least but the other one just pure blood test just seems like why wouldn't why wouldn't this be offered a covered by insurance or or you know that anyone that wanted it but now now I understand why you mentioned menopause huge topic enormous topic uh we had a guest on the podcast who's not a clinician who said something in passing so I wanted I likely to get this wrong um but what they said was that the results of the large scale trials on hormone replacement therapy for women for menopause said something to the effect of if the hormone therapy was started early enough it was very beneficial for yes vitality and health outcomes whereas if women went through menopause and then initiated the hormone therapy hormone replacement therapy that it could be detrimental to their health so first of all uh do I recall that statement correctly and then second of all what sorts of hormones are being replaced is it just estrogen and how is that done is it done through birth control so oral contraceptives nver Rings what are your thoughts on menopause when should people start thinking about it and what is the pallet of things available so that we can do an entire episode with you on on this topic in the future but just to I you know I get a lot of questions about this and and I'm guessing based on everything you've told me today that there are women in their 30s that while they may be 20 years out from menopause probably should be doing things now in anticipation of that yes so we haven't talked about the 30-some but I totally agree with you the more you know about your phenotype your hormonal phenotype when you're in your 30s you're set up in terms of what to do in the future especially things like your thyroid your estrogen and progesterone levels because you can replace to a state of you thyroid whatever that is for you you can replace I don't usually go exactly back to where the estrogen and progesterone levels were were but we can get pretty close so in your 30s having a base case I think is really essential so you spoke to the Women's Health Initiative which was published in 2002 and we went from a huge number of women taking hormone therapy to a very small percentage like in the range of 5% and that means we've got millions millions of women who are suffering needlessly with things like insomnia difficult with their mood difficulty with sex drive um feeling like they are closing the store in terms of sex because they're not on hormone therapy I would agree with the statement that you made that hormone therapy particular forms that are similar to what your body always made when it's given judiciously at the right time typically within 5 to 10 years of menopause which is 51 to 52 that it is incredibly safe so it's a complicated study the women's health initiative but it was the the wrong study in the wrong patients with the wrong medications and um with some of the wrong outcomes so it was powered to look at cardiovascular outcomes it was not powered to look at breast cancer it was stopped because of breast cancer risk but what happened in the control arm of the study was that they had an incredibly low rate of breast cancer and so as a result they ended up having this increased risk of breast cancer at 5 years and they stopped the study now the study was done with synthetics it was done with conjugated equin estrogen known as Premarin and mroy progesterone acetate those were the so-called estrogen and progesterone those are uh synthetic hormones we think especially the progest is associated with the greater risk of breast cancer although the the subsequent re-evaluations of the data now 18 years out have shown that um this problem with the control group and no increased risk of breast cancer um and for the women who got estrogen only those who had a hysterectomy the Premarin they actually had a decreased breast cancer risk and decreased breast cancer mortality so there's a lot to be said about this I'm trying to keep it really brief brief but if you look at the women 50 to 60 So within 10 years of menopause they're the ones who seem to have the greatest benefit so they had a decreased subclinical atherosclerosis so less cardiovascular disease they had an improvement in terms of um bone health um less progression to diabetes and then over the age of 60 they started to have greater risk of certain outcomes such as cardiovascular disease myocardial infection and so on you asked about um what do I do and to me this problem is not just menopause what's more interesting is to talk about per menopause so per menopause is the the period of time before your final menstrual cycle and for most women depending on how attuned you are of the symptoms it can last for 10 years so I'm still in Period menopause it's been like 20 years because I've been tracking it so carefully it usually gets kicked off by having your cycle get closer together so that can happen in your 30s or your 40s you go from 28 days to 25 days that sort of thing you may notice that you start sleeping more poorly because progesterone is so important you talked about that with Kyle you may notice it as more anxiety difficulty sleeping and that probably is related to the estrogen receptor so e Alpha is estrogen receptor Alpha is enio um it increases anxiety ER beta is associated with an angiolytic activity and then there's a total of about six estrogen receptors now there's the the G protein coupled estrogen receptors and those are mixed angiolytic angiogenic so um there's this whole period of paropa and what's Most Fascinating to me and we've got to talk about this either today or another time is that there is this massive massive change that happens in the female brain that people are not talking about enough and so looking at the work of Lisa mascone at Cornell from uh starting around age 40 there is this massive change in cerebral metabolism so you can do fdg pet scans you can look at glucose uptake and there's about on average a 20% decline from Prem menopause you know up to like age 35 to per menopause to postmenopause the women who are having the most symptoms in per menopause menopause The Hot Flashes the night sweats the difficulties sleeping those are the ones who have the most significant cerebral hypo metabolism so it's almost like a um I don't I don't want to scare people with this language but it's it's a lowlevel or let's call it pseudo dementia of sorts yes it it it seems to be a phenotype that you can then map to Alzheimer's disease because that's Lisa musc's work she's looking at okay Alzheimer's disease is not a disease of old age it is disease of middle age what are some of the biomarkers that we can Define that can tell you what your risk is I've got a mother and a grandmother with Alzheimer's disease you can believe I am all over this data and insulin resistance ins sensitivity as we talked about it before um seems to be somewhere in there which I think when that first when that idea first surfaced a few people are like really but then of course right I mean the brain is this incredibly metabolically demanding organ you deprive neurons of fuel sources they or you make them less sensitive to fuel sources they start dying they they certainly start firing less it makes perfect sense and I think now it's thanks to Lisa's work work that you've you've done in a talked about quite a lot is um in your books and elsewhere I think has really you know highlighted for people that metabolism and metabolomics is going to be as important as genes and genomics when it comes to right dementia perhaps especially in women is it safe to say that I think I think so because we believe that the system is regulated by estrogen so the decline in estrogen starting around age 40 43 is kind of the average seems to be the driver behind cerebral hypom metabolism the way I describe it to my patients is it's like slow brain energy so you walk into a room you can't remember why like you just notice that you can't manage all the tasks the way that you once could like things are just a little slower and I say that to women they're like I have that like help me so this is then circling back to Whi where women are scared to death of taking hormone therapy and we've got all of these women that are Marching toward potentially a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease and they have this opportunity in their 40s and their 50s to take hormone therapy and they may not be offered it because the typical conventional approach based on Whi is to say unless you're having hot flashes and night sweats that are severe I'm not going to give you hormone therapy and I I just want to call that out I would say no that is not the way to approach it further the concept right now in conventional medicine is that hot flashes and night sweats are these nuisance symptoms that we will take care of temporarily maybe with a little bit of estrogen progesterone or birth control pill because it's given a lot or that they pass this idea you know suck it up suck it up doesn't matter that you're not sleeping anymore you know turn down the temperature in your room and that's not right because hot fleshes and night sweats are a biomarker of cardiometabolic disease they are a biomarker of increased bone loss they are a biomarker of changes in the brain so many of these symptoms that occur in perimenopause are not driven by the ovaries they are driven by the brain yeah it's the the bidirectional cross talk between the body and the brain keeps you know I think is this resounding theme uh we had Chris Palmer on here a psychiat who's talking about ketogenic diet for treat mental health I know you we could have a whole other discussion and we will I hope if you'll agree to it about nutrition and as it relates to hormones um specific diets and so forth but the and that's a question too whether this problem of cerebral hypometabolism could we solve it with estrogen Andor increase metabolic flexibility so I just wanted to footnote that sorry to interrupt you no please uh please interrupt um uh I I know you're as long as we're there I know you are a fan in some instances of intermittent fasting time restricted feeding Andor ketogenic diet yes um to get cells sensitive to insulin which is not to say if I understand correctly which is not to say that women need to stay on the ketogenic diet for long periods of time or intermittent fast by only time restricted feeding for 8 hours or 6 hours a day but that by increasing you said met abolic flexibility excuse me but by increasing cells sensitivity to insulin and then maybe returning to a more typical eating pattern and periodically switching back and forth that might actually benefic be beneficial do I have that right yeah I love the pulse so I feel like it's much more physiologic than say going on a ketogenic diet and staying there for years all of the data that we have on the ketogenic diet it's pretty Limited in terms of duration you know the the longest players that we have in terms of the data are the folks with epilepsy and that's just a different phenotype so I think in terms of microbiome effects diversity disbiosis some of those issues we really don't know in terms of long-term effects so I prefer with a ketogenic diet that it's used as an nof one experiment and that you do it for four weeks maybe you measure biom merkers before and afterwards maybe look at your stool before and afterwards and we still haven't talked about stool tests yet but you could measure you're fasting insulin and your glucose you could just start there do four weeks of Keto clean keto including vegetables doesn't have to be 57 a day and then measure it again afterwards since you measure mentioned stool testing yes um what what is your recommendation about stool testing so my recommendation this is again in the the field of if you have the disposable income so I usually start with goova because they've got a good co-pay system with insurance that's what I typically use so I usually do their one day stool test where you have to go digging through your stool and send it off to this lab that's in North Carolina I usually do the one day unless I'm concerned about parasites in that case I tend to do three days I do that for people who travel a fair amount and go to places where there's greater risk or they just have gut symptoms another test that I do a lot is um cuz I was like to mention two Labs is a test by longevity and this is much more of a data wonk uh type of test because it's powered by AI it was designed by um a guy who's got inflammatory bowel disease and he is a um he's a PhD deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy who wanted to make this really easy so the test is is under the umbrella of thorn and um they used call it gut bio they might have another name for it and they just improved it so that it's a a wipe instead of digging through your stool and so my athletes will do it now they were not so into digging through their stool before is anybody really no one is I don't want the answer I know the answer I prefer to that question but that's a super interesting test because it's you get much more dense data the issue is um um with apologies to my friends at Thorne the issue is that their recommendations end up being Thorn supplements so that can be very easy for people who want to you know connect the dots that's not always the way that I like to do it uh first of all three things um you've shared with us an immense amount of knowledge uh and in that first statement I also want to apologize because I threw you the entire lifespan of uh female lifespan reproductive Health contraception diet uh microbiome so many things but um I first I just want to say you've taught me a tremendous amount um including I think something that most people including myself have not thought about enough which is the psychosocial impact on things that we're all familiar with constipation bowel movements what we eat what we avoid I have to say really a huge thank you for that because it's not something that's been discussed on this podcast before sort of know that brain communicates with body psychology and biology are linked but I think this is the first time that anyone's ever directly linked circumstances and biology and psychology in such a concrete way so that's the that's the first thing and I I speak for many people on that second of all we barely scratch the surface of your know knowledge and um which is both uh frustrating for me because uh it I always want to learn more and I know many other people do as well but also very very exciting because uh with uh hopefully without much persuasion we can have you back on to talk about pers at all like men uh I know you're working with men now Men's Health um some particulars around per I think there's more for us to explore in terms of PCS menopause contraception and all of the above but then something that you and I were talking about off camera um before started which I think is a really important factor that ties back to this issue of of trauma and stress and the bidirectional relationship between biology and psychology hopefully someday we won't even separate those two um which is the use of specific medicines including plant medicines yes and how that can influence overall health which no doubt will include Hormone Health so I say all of that for two reasons first of all to queue up the we won't even call it a part two but a equal to to this which um I'm gratified to hear that you you'll join us for that and then also to just really extend a huge thank you the amount of knowledge that you shared is is immense and uh is going to be very very useful and actionable for for men in terms of their thinking and their actions and for women in particular today's discussion in particular for women in terms of how to think about their health and biology how to think about their psychology and the environment that all of that embedded in so I just want to say an enormous thank you thank you Andrew I so appreciate that and I so appreciate what you offer to the world in terms of a way in a way to understand physiology and how to craft a architect a better life um can I just add one last thing because I didn't talk about it since we didn't get to the 40s and the 50s in this list of biomarkers to so I feel like if people if women went away with one thing today it would be to do a coronary artery calcium score by age 45 and sooner if you've got premature heart disease how is that taken so it's a CT scan of the chest you can self-order it like I think at Stanford Hospital you can self-order it last time a patient checked it was $250 so again disposable income but it it tells you it it almost gives you this fork in the road in terms of how much you need to pay attention to cardiometabolic health as a woman and it's 45 for men too so if you haven't had one have you had one no you need one insulin cortisol CAC great so I'll run all that by you it's really essential and it's um yeah it's it's so fascinating because you know there's some women who have a zero so my score is zero and that's great so often you can just keep doing what you're doing but if you're 45 and you're starting to be elevated or you've got you know maybe you've got PCOS or you've got some other biomarkers tending you in this direction toward the number one killer really eight to nine out of the top 10 killers in the US that allows you to really start to make changes and I I think it's essential to know that data it's not it's probably not going to be offered by your doctor certainly Peter AA is going to offer it but most conventional doctors are not going to do it and then the last thing I want to say before you mention so if I were to go to my doctor and I just say I want a a cardiac calcium score that's what people coronary artery calcium score CAC okay so everyone hear that and know that if you're 40 or older and maybe if you're 45 or older get get it so the last thing is and this for men and women is your a score so adverse childhood experiences knowing your a score is so essential in terms of a baseline for how much trauma your system your Pine system endured when you were a kid and we know that childhood trauma whether it's abuse or neglect or you know having an alcoholic parent that maps to disease in middle age and it can give you so much Insight I'll give you an example I've got a patient who had an elevated coronary artery calcium score who does everything right with her food I think it was her trauma that elevated her C when she was 45 so I think an a score knowing your a score starting as a teenager like knowing it and knowing how to work with that is really essential there are certain people they are exceedingly rare but you are one such person that when they speak knowledge just comes from comes out of them and it's incredibly useful and helpful knowledge so thank you I'm going to get both of those things good um and I highly recommend everyone else pursue ways that they can get those or if they can't get them that they you know earmark those as things to get at the point where they they can obtain sufficient uh disposable income sounds like that the health uh the detriments to health that those can offset would be well worth the cost totally thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion all about female hormone Health vitality and Longevity with Dr Sarah gotfried if you'd like to learn more about Dr gotf Freed's work please check out her social media channels we've provided links to those in the show note captions in addition please check out one or all of Dr G reads excellent books that she's written about nutrition supplementation and various treatments for Hormone Health longevity and vitality we've linked a two of those notably women food and hormones and her book the hormone cure in our show note captions if you're learning from Andor enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube channel that's a terrific

Twitter Facebook and Linkedin and I should mention that on both Instagram and Twitter I cover science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance some of which overlap with the contents of the ubberman Lab podcast but much of which is distinct from the contents of the hubman Lab podcast again at hubman lab on all social media channels and if you haven't already subscribe to the hubman Lab podcast so-called neural network newsletter that's a monthly newsletter it's completely zero cost and we provide summaries of podcast episodes as well as summaries of tools for everything from optimizing sleep to Hormone Health deliberate cold exposure deliberate heat exposure Fitness and so on it's very easy to sign up for you go to hubman lab.com go to the menu and scroll to newsletter you simply provide your email we do not share your email with anybody as I mentioned before it is completely zero cost again that's the neural network newsletter and you can find it at hubman lab.com during today's episode and on many previous episodes of The hubman Lab podcast we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for everything from sleep to focus to hormone regulation the ubberman Lab podcast is happy to announce that we partnered with momentus supplements because momentus supplements are of the absolute highest quality also they include many single ingredient formulations which is essential if you wanted to design a supplement regimen that is both cost- effective and the most biologically effective supplement regimen that's very hard to do with blends of supplements it's very straightforward to do with single ingredient formulations also momenta supplements ship internationally which is important because we realize that many of you reside outside of the United States if you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the hubman Lab podcast you can go to Liv momentus spelled ous so that's liv.com huberman thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion all about female hormone Health vitality and Longevity with Dr Sarah gotfried and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science [Music]

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm our professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the second episode in the sixth episode series with Dr Andy Galpin a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world's experts on the science and applications of methods to increase strength hypertrophy and endurance today's episode is all about how to increase strength speed and hypertrophy of muscles Professor Dr Andy Galpin great to be back last episode you told us about the nine specific adaptations that exercise can induce everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance muscular endurance so on and so forth and you gave us this incredible toolkit of fit tests for each of those adaptations so that people can assess them for themselves and then of course improve on each and every one of them if they choose by the way people can access that information simply by going to the first episode in this series with you and it's all there in time stamped and I highly recommend people do that today we're talking about strength and hypertrophy and so right out the gate I just want to ask you why should people think about and train for strength and hypertrophy and that question is of course directed towards those that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles but I know that many people out there perhaps have not thought about the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training and how beneficial it can be not just for people that want to get bigger biceps Etc but that have other goals longevity goals and health goals unrelated to what most people associate with hypertrophy so what are the benefits of training for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person for the athlete for the recreational exerciser and so on there's a wonderful saying um I think it was Bill bman the founder one of the founders of Nike and he always saidif you have a body you're an athlete and and I think that's very important for people to understand because one of the major disservices we've done in this field is convince people that things like strength training are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles and cardiovascular training are for things like fat loss and heart health and that is a tremendous disservice because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers and leads to a lot of false assumptions and therefore poor actions uh classic examples of this are people who are resistant to strength training because they don't want to put on too much muscle um people who only perform one type of exercise because they want say fat loss or they're in it for longevity and health and they don't worry they're not worried about you know being an athlete and so right out the gates we can actually draw back a little bit to what we were our previous conversation when I walked you through the history of of exercise science and the reason I did that is to help you understand these are the railroads that you're running down and you don't even realize it in terms of everyone thinks of strength training and they immediately default to our principles to optimize muscle growth and that's not the only adaptation one should be after with strength training when we think of endurance training we immediately default to things like again cardiovascular health or fat loss or things like that what I really want to do across this entire um series and conversations is to to just break that immediately talk about all the other things that you can do with your with your training uh and so that people can be comfortable and confident in doing an optimal training program for whatever goal they have whether that be specific like growing muscle or non-specific like just feeling better having more energy um being more prepared for life and and Longevity and so to directly answer your question I could really we could do a 100 episodes on the benefits of exercise and we could run all the way from mood and focus um cognitive tasks to a better immune function you'll get less colds you'll be you'll fight them off more effectively um to mortality right so some of the strongest predictors of how long and how well you will live or exercise however there are independent benefits that come from just endurance training and there are independent benefits that come from strength training and so to just give you one categorically the way that you want to think about this is resistance exercise and strength training is the number one tool to combat neuromuscular aging you cannot get that through any other form of exercise besides heavy overload strength training and we and we can walk through in detail what that is but that is reason number one in general human movement is is a function of number one some sort of neuromuscular Activation so nerves have to turn on the second part is muscles have to contract and the third part is those muscles have to move a bone all right if you want to be alive and you want to live by yourself you have to be able to engage in human movement if you have any dysfunction in the neuromuscular system there then you're not going to be able to do that and again as I mentioned the only way to preserve that or fight that loss of Aging is to strength train so people will tend to hear numbers like you lose about 1% of muscle size per year after age about 40 and that's true however what they don't realize is you lose about 2 to 4% of your strength per year so the loss of strength is almost double that the loss of muscle mass with aging muscle power is more like 8 to 10% per year and so we can very clearly see the problem you're going to have with aging is not going to be preservation of muscle although that is incredibly important it's going to be very specifically preservation of muscle power and strength and why that really matters is your ability to again stand up and move your ability to catch yourself from a fall your ability to feel confident doing a movement um that is the function of muscle power more than it is muscle size and so functionality is really what we want to be right you want to be able to do whatever you want to be do physically and feel confident in doing that as you age that's going to only be obtained through strength training so is it appropriate to say that training for strength and hypertrophy is also a way to keep your nervous system healthy and young yeah absolutely it is the only exercise route we have for that uh if you look at just basic numbers like motor units you're going to see that older individuals have like a 30 to 40% production in total motor units So when you say older approximately what ages are you referring to because I know many people out there such as myself are 40 and older but I know many of our listeners are in their 20s maybe even in their teens and I can imagine that people that start doing strength and hypertrophy training younger will afford themselves an advantage over time but that everybody should be doing strength and hypertrophy training for as much of their lifespan as possible that's really the message that I'm getting um so if somebody is for instance 45 would that fall into the bin of older you're going to start seeing decrements past again around that age of 40 or so now there's a lot of genetic variation there and a lot of other things go into that equation like your sleep and your nutrition but that's a fair number to sort of think about um one actually response is it's actually sort of counterintuitive the wonderful thing about strength training is you don't actually have to start at a young age uh you can actually in fact I was reading a paper this morning because of our previous conversation it was in over age 90 so these are folks 90 plus and they saw improvements like 30 to 170% in things like muscle size and hypertrophy over a very short period of time I think it was 12 weeks so you don't actually have to start there are some adaptations that you're going to need for health that you God you really need to start in your 20s the reason I like to mention that is because if you are listening and you are 50 and you're like oh [ __ ] I I haven't been strength training you're not toast like you should absolutely start now but you you're going to be able to get to a a fantastic spot very quickly similarly though if you are 20 or 25 and 30 and you aren't lifting there are still many reasons why you should do that now and I I I'd like to point that out because a lot of folks will be like oh my gosh they said I have to do it when I'm 20 or 25 or you know I'll be sort of screwed and that's not the case at all there's really no age limit on this in fact there's actually interesting data that just came out showing um this reduction in muscle strength and hypertrophy that I sort of talked about is basically amiliar with a preservation of activity in other words you don't lose these functionalities because of Aging you lose these because of a loss of training to state that again you don't lose these because of some innate physiological thing that happens with genes become less sensitive or you lose functionality you pretty much can describe the loss of function of strength and muscle in aging as exclusively because of a loss of training in nutrition and and anabolic resistance and some other things so you can do a lot more than you think um when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle and that's really important to point out I'm reminded of the words of the great sharington he won the Nobel Prize a physiologist uh I guess the neuroscientist try and claim him as a neuroscientist because he worked on the nervous system the physiologist claim as a as a physiologist he is 100% a physiologist I would call him a neuroscientist maybe we can argue about this later um we will but I think one of the key things that sharington pointed out was that and I believe the quote was that movement is the final common path and what he was referring to was the fact that a significant fraction of the brain itself is devoted to our ability to move and our ability to engage in resistance type movements and that resistance type movements and the continuation of movement throughout the lifespan is what keeps the brain Young and healthy and vital and there are so much data now to support that but I'm so grateful that you brought up early this fact that there's a neuromuscular link because I think a lot of people think about muscoskeletal they forget that the nervous system is really in charge of the um strength of of the muscle contractions and the types of muscle contractions that occur I'm certain we're going to get into that in a lot of depth today you're close there we're not totally right but we're close Okay well I I look forward to being corrected um and to achieving the Precision that you're known for uh around that discussion so if we are to step back and say strength training and hypertrophy training is critical for people of all ages yeah for developing and maintaining the neuromuscular system and for our ability to function in the world yeah not just offset injury but the ability to pick things up and move Etc what are some of the other things that strength and hypertrophy training um can provide I know a lot of people use strength and hypertrophy training for changing their Aesthetics yeah what is your sense about its potency for changing Aesthetics as compared to say cardiovascular exercise yeah the the Mantra I always like is the reason you want to exercise is three-fold right you want to look good feel good played that that's really that comes from sport um comes from football specifically we always say that and what that means really is you want to look good people want to look the way they want to look whatever that means to them and there are any versions of what you feel to be a i al pleasing and that's totally irrelevant but people want to look the way they want to look um number two you want to be able to feel good what's that mean you want to be injury-free you want to have energy throughout the day you want to be able to execute anything you want to so whether you want to go surf in the morning you want to play ret ball or you want to hike or you want to do all three of those in one day you should have the ability to do that and then you want to play good which means you should be able to execute um any again activities uh that you want to execute whatever that means all right so backing all up what's that got to do with your question um um one of the major benefits of strength training is the responses tend to happen extremely fast so you can see noticeable changes in muscle size certainly within a month absolutely within six weeks and so we have this wonderful feedback loop that sort of tells you am I doing this incorrectly oh my gosh yes I am also it's very addicting the feedback the response the physical changes whether this is actually point two or three look good or feel good play good or it's even just part one you're starting to see that when you compare compare that to things like fat loss that Journey tends to be longer it's more difficult it's more relying upon other factors like nutrition Etc strength training is really about like there's some very minimal nutrition requirements outside that it comes down of the training and the feedback is immediate that's powerful because if you look across uh the literature on exercise adherence you'll see that that is in fact the number one predictor of effectiveness of any training program so what that means is if you were to put any variable possible and figure out what is going to determine whether or not this program works um this is what we typically called the methods are many and the concepts are few so the methods of exercise the methods of strength training the method methods of hypertrophy training which we'll talk about are are infinite however there are only a handful of key Concepts that you have to achieve in order for that program to work adherence is one of them and again is often the top one so you need to do something you need to do something consistently when you are getting that feedback and you're seeing results in your appearance immediately and you see that every single day every time you take off your shirt or every time you um look in the mirror you see that result that tends to drive adherence um really powerfully so it's important to give people wins especially people who are not maybe like you and I who are like I'm going to lift weights and I'm going to exercise like no matter what the rest of my life because I just love it not everyone's like that and so giving them a little bit of carrot of success and if you can achieve that in you know say three to four to five weeks already um it's very powerful tool before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is also separate from Dr galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentus momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality the huberman Lab podcast is is proud to be partnering with momentus for several important reasons first of all as I mentioned their supplements are of extremely high quality

been using an eights Sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has complet completely transformed my sleep I'm sleeping about the same amount but I'm sleeping far deeper and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straight forward I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature and waking up involves a 1 to 3° increase in core body temperature with eights Sleep mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night a different temperature the middle of the night and a different temperature as you approach morning Each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever if you'd like to try Aid sleep you can go to AIDS sleep.com huberman and check out their

glucose using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood glucose level is critical for everything from Fat Loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most people do not know however how different foods and different activities including exercise or different temperatured environments impact their blood glucose levels and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things I first started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels and I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels it's taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels. link huberman that's levels. linkhub let's talk about strength and hypertrophy if you would please remind us what strength and hypertrophy are in terms of the specific adaptation they represent what I mean by that is when somebody is training for strength what are they really training for obviously it means the ability to move more weight but I know that it includes a number of other things as well and when one is training for hypertrophy for the growth of muscle fibers what does that represent because I think if people understand that they will far better understand the methods and protocols that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy at its core you you've basically described it when we talk about strength we're talking about an actual function so can you create more Force across a muscle or muscle groups or or total movement and when we talk about hypertrophy now we're specifically referring to just an increase in size there's no actual mention of function so a muscle can grow larger without actually technically being stronger for a number of reasons um however there is a strong relationship between strength and hypertrophy so a lot of the times in the general public in the lay conversations we sort of those two things in it's the same thing and so we have to recognize people who are new to training or people even are intermediately trained there is a huge overlap between strength and hypertrophy once you get past that though they become disentangled and a good example of it is this if you look at these strongest people in the world this would be people who compete in the sport of powerlifting right that's a true test of maximum strength so it is a deadlift a bench press and a back squat and you're going to do a one repetition Max in all three of those and so whoever wins is the person who lifted the most amount of weight one time that's it it's not like World's Strongest Man where it is how many reps can you do in a row or your time right is a true maximal strength test and you compare those to say bodybuilders now both of those individuals are strong and both of those individuals have a lot of muscle however it is extremely clear the powerlifters will be significantly stronger than the bodybuilders on average right there are individual exceptions but we're just talking Collective averages and the bodybuilders will have more muscle than the other ones in addition whether you look at Olympic weightlifting or powerlifting or world's strongest man for that matter there are weight classes and the reason is as you go up in weight classes you will always see the world records go higher and higher and higher right so you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle however there's a point right where you simp simply have to add more mass to get a higher number and that's why we have weight classes in those Sports and in Combat Sports and lots of other things so we have there's a lot of confusion right because people think man either these are the same thing or if I want to get stronger I have to get bigger which is not the case at all another misnomer here is I can't get stronger unless I add muscle that's not true either right this a similar idea so what what I'm saying is you have the ability to do whatever you'd like if you'd like like to get stronger and add muscle great if you add muscle you're probably going to bring some strength along for the ride however if you want to get stronger and you don't want to add muscle for any reason personal preference on Aesthetics whether you're in a weight class and you simply can't afford it it is quite easy to get stronger and not add much muscle math either and so differentiating these two things is one of them is simply a measure of size and the other one is a measure of force and when we talk about strength what we're really talking about are two unique components component one is what I call the physiology so what what is the ability of the neuromuscular system what is the ability of the muscle fibers to contract and produce Force the other one is what we call mechanics mechanics is simply things like it's minutia down to how long your femurs are relative to your tibia or or other things like this is biomechanics this is also technique this is skill this is how smooth you feel this is are you firing the right muscle group in the right sequence and Order and all of these things play into strength so somebody who maybe has U more Force capability in their muscle fibers but their technique and the movement is worse may lose in a competition or somebody again who's um like if you go into the world of speed and power especially you'll hear a lot of people talk about like the Rhythm and there's just a certain Rhythm that has to happen if you want to jump as high as possible or run as F fast as possible but that's all mechanics at this fundamental level so when we look at hypertrophy it's just still simply about how big the muscle is so those are the really the the the similarities and distinctions between strength and hypertrophy when strength improves and when hypertrophy increases is there also involvement in the ligaments and tendons that is of course the ligaments and tendons are involved in the movements and but do ligaments and tendons themselves grow Andor get stronger this field is really difficult because uh connective tissue is not vascular and so their plasticity is significantly lower than skeletal muscle in fact if you look across all the organs skeletal muscle is one of if not the most plastic meaning it's the most pliable the most responsive um the one that's going to adjust it's basically it's paying attention to everything that's being said in the body um you cannot change blood pressure or pH or um macronutrients floating around without muscle knowing about it it is uh in fact this is why we call muscle an organ people don't tend to think about this if you were ever on like Jeopardy and they ask you that question of like what's the biggest organ system in the body people tend to say the skin muscle is actually the correct answer all right well I'm going to cite you when I get it you probably get wrong je Jeopardy I don't have any immediate plans to go on Jeopardy but who knows oh there you go Celebrity Jeopardy hry huberman wait uh I don't know about the celebrity part but Jeopardy would be fun um but I will say the muscle and I'll I'll if you get a phone call on Jeopardy I don't know I haven't seen that show a very long time yeah U maybe ever then I'll I'll call you but that makes sense um that muscles would be the largest organ system in the body the reason I saying that is so muscle is both listening and talking it is controlling uh the immune system a lot it's controlling blood glucose regulation it is it is the central Depot for uh amino acids which are needed to things like regulate the immune system build um any new red blood cells a lot of this stuff is coming from skeleton muscles so when we say organ by the way that's actually like a physiological definition so something that's communicating uh to either another organ itself or uh throughout the system so it's listening and it's talking connective tissue is not the same way and so we do see adaptations with strength training um in connective tissue it's just much lower it's difficult to measure um effectively what we know now is you're going to have a combination um of adaptations throughout the connected tissue it is beneficial uh this is probably one of the major reasons that's that strength training reduces injury risk which is very very important because people who tend to want to pick up an exercise routine after say 10 years um the the classic cliche is like I played all these things in high school then I went to college got a job now I'm 25 or 35 or whatever and you sort of want to jump back into what you did when you're were 20 well there's no tissue tolerance left and what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue the tolerance in there is is not ready for the load you're about to handle and so you go through some movement and then boom sprains tears um you know even like the more significant ones are on ailles tear which is going to really sideline you so those are some of the problems and we know strength training has a a large role in injury reduction for stress and strain and overuse injuries and that's specifically coming for the connected tissue adaptations again the difficult part here is it's very hard to assess we actually uh when I was a doctoral student we played around with Patel attendant biopsies so I actually had one this is like a there's a little piece of your Patel attendant missing yeah because your own own lab so now I've probably had I don't know how many hundreds of biopsies I've performed on people um probably well over a thousand certainly well over a thousand I've probably had 35 or 40 done them myself um there's no problem here I have no Scar Tissue I have no loss of function and I've stuck needles in every leg like all over myself right quads uh my Solus gastrock like all up and down taking tissue out yeah you go with the needle looks like a pen basically and you you know you're live and you go in and grab a chunk and you pull it out and can I come to your lab and get biopsy absolutely yeah you're probably looking under the microscope it'll just look like the molecule caffeine there's a there's a a mutual friend of ours who came down and did that he's a big big big gentleman big in the lifting very into strength training uh and he he went through that experience and he was like oh my God it was not what he was hoping to get he actually had unbelievable muscle morphology his fibers were um the diameter of muscle fibers is extremely large it's one of the biggest cells by volume in all the biology skeleton muscle and human how large can't help myself um millimeters well you so you have length and then you have width right so lengthwise they can be extraordinarily long you can be the classic example is like your Sartorius which is like the front of your hip to the inside of your kneecap theoretically those cells can run the entire length which would be one muscle fiber running that thing um if if I were to do a biopsy on you and I and I pull that tissue out I could actually pull an individual fiber out with tweezers and hold it up and you could see that whole muscle cell yeah I'm definitely not going to be allowed to get biopsy um you'd be stunned how big they are anyways his was the size of a rhino so the diameter of his now he has a a well documented assistance in the area of muscle growth we'll say MH um but yeah those can be large so what were we even talking about there well I was asking about tendons and ligaments because I'd like to understand the various tissues and organ systems that adapt when one gets stronger when muscle tissue grows and I I I do want to ask about bone yeah um and here I'm not referring to Bone mineral density what I was going to ask is whether or not bone itself can grow and get stronger and the reason I'm asking is there's a favorite result of mine I have about 3,800 favorite results 3,000 pet peeves and 3,800 plus uh favorite results um but one of my favorite results is from Eric kendell's Lab at Columbia Eric won the Nobel Prize for learning and memory and his laboratory got really into the effects of exercise on learning and memory yeah and they had this incredible result which is that loadbearing exercise yeah stimulates the bones to release something called Al osteocalcin excuse me and then osteocalcin acts as a more or less a hormone travels to the brain and enhances the memory systems in the brain by enhancing neuron Health that's the basic Crux of of the studies there were several of these and The Moment I Saw the first of those studies I thought well here's another reason to do resistance type exercise and not just aerobic exercise and then it brings to mind whether or not bones themselves get stronger when we do resistance training I don't know the answer to that yeah that's very clearly demonstrated and we've known that for for many decades um you have a diminishing ability to do so with age uh particularly you need to do this in your teens and 20s this is where you're going to have the largest ability to enhance um bone mineral density and it's particularly responsive to axial loading now I'm a muscle guy I'm not a bone specialist so we would have to consult somebody that can give you more Precision here but that's you explain axial loading it's it's up and down it's vertical okay so it's almost like a like a cylinder putting weight of the on the small end of the cylinder on both small end of the cylinders if someone doesn't do this in their 20s or teens however can we assume that some degree of positive change will occur if they do resistance training even if it's a small fraction the answer is yes it is small um we have worked with a number of women in our um our rapid health program that come in and they are in their 20s and they're in their 30s and they have significant bone Minal density problems and eight months later we can see noticeable changes that are outside of the measurement error of of a dexa positive changes positive changes correct and if you worked with the there are many Physicians that specialize in this area you you're going to need a Nutri nutrition here um strength TR loone is probably not going to get you there particularly with women because you have to figure out why and and there's a lot going on with the physiology and biochemistry so you probably like almost surely need to have some blood chemistry done with that um you have to figure out what's going on menstrual cycle wise in fact like oftentimes what we'll do for our women very specifically is we use a thing called The Rhythm plus a 30-day test so you can actually do a salivary test across the entire menstrual cycle and you can take uh samples it's about every other day so you'll get 15 or 16 samples and you get a really beautiful picture of what's Happening hormonally across the entire menstrual cycle and that's really really important because typically for women uh if you get a single sample or simple time Point whether it's salivary urine or blood you can have um well like a order of magnitude difference in in any number of metrics because of what phase are in this is one of the many reasons why it's been such a challenge to do a lot of physiology research with females um some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle others don't like strength is a very good example I can strength train and I can do a one rep max test on a woman at any point I don't have to do that at a certain phase of their menstrual cycle because it's it's the evidence I think is pretty clear at this point that number won't change so I have no qualms including females in any of my studies where strength is an absolute is an important dependent variable because I don't have to adjust around menstrual cycle other factors like anything in in blood anything hormone related you're going to have to automatically account for it so what I would say is those folks should absolutely work with a qualified physician um and and you you're going to have to get some nutrition supplementation potentially uh and then maybe even some other stuff going on to make that even more complicated if you're on any form of birth control or not that's going to change the entire equation especially if it's a hormone based birth control so it just gets really really complicated um to answer it though you can see adaptations they are significantly diminished U relative to if you would have started in your teens and 20s but there is hope you just need to work with somebody who specializes in that area so for both men and women boys and girls what are the major adaptations that occur to underly improvements in strength and if you would if you could just provide a bullet point list of that and then we can dive into each of those in detail for instance our nerves getting more efficient at firing our bones enjoying adaptations in different yeah bone connective tissue relationships that that underly strength I have to imagine all of these things are happening but what are the the major changes that are occurring in those organs and organ systems that reflect someone's ability to on one day lift you know 100 pounds and then a week later to lift uh 105 pounds now I I'll try to keep this condensed again this could be an entire University of course um I will also try to give you a little bit of Bones here so normally as a muscle guy I only I take all the credit in muscle turns out the nervous system gets a little bit of credit too here thank you so as we walk through it just in as as a big picture if we think about again what causes human movement basically everything along that chain will improve a strength training and I'm not really being using too much hyperbole there it's quite impressive so just going from the nervous system the equation what has to happen for human movement is a nerve has to send a signal through a motor unit now a motor unit uh is comes down and inates multiple muscle fibers so if you think about your actual muscle it's not a thing it is a component of many individual muscle fibers so you've got millions if not more um think of it like a ponytail so we collectively say ponytail and you think of it as like one thing but really a ponytail is a combination of tons of individual hairs okay muscles the same way so this motor unit comes in and innovates a lot of different muscle fibers now every one of the fibers in a motor unit is generally of the same fiber type so fast twitch or slow twitch and they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle they are spread out across uh horizontally vertically as well as um closer to the Bone and further to the surface so they're they're moved throughout the entire way and this is what allows you to have smoother contractions and you don't have specificity and things like that so we see improvements from the neuromuscular side like firing rate we see synchronization improvements um that that are coming in you all also see um improvements in things like acetylcholine release from the presynaptic neuron um so you're getting it faster we see calcium recycling is improved back uh to their so in in order for without walking into too much of the biochemistry in order for a signal to go from nerve to muscle there's a little bit of a gap there's a physical space that happens and what happens is you release this molecule called AC cocoline this goes into the postoptic CFT and then that actually binds to a receptor that receptor actually opens up a door that lets sodium in that's really what's happening so it's not theine well that aceto cooline then sits on that receptor site it's broken down put back in and recycled back up in the preoptic nerve site the faster you can do that the faster you can recycle that signal and so almost everything that I described in that entire system improves and has been shown to to to increase with training so that alone is given to give you benefits we haven't even walked into getting from an electrical signal now into an act potential which is going to cause a muscle contraction so getting from nerve into the muscle we see everything from improvements in way call contractility which means the muscle fiber themselves can produce more force or more velocity independent of muscle size changes so this is another component when we ask like well how is that I got stronger without getting bigger well in the muscle fiber itself its ability to contract Force increases and this because we have everything like the sarcoplasm reticulum which is the Place stores and releases the calcium which is what's needed for this entire crossbridge interaction from the meas and an actin um to happen I know a lot of I just lost a lot of people but you can go look at some of these images the Saras matrium gets uh gets activated more it gets more sense it is better at releasing calcium bringing it back in and doing it again um the bond between the crossbridge the mein and actin gets stronger um the calcium Affinity is the phrase that we use there um increases so we we're literally walking through almost the entire process of skeletal muscle contraction here and every step along the way we we see Improvement so that net result is we see again more Force production independent of any change in size independent of any increase in contractile units we didn't add anything to the equation we didn't change size we did nothing but improve efficiency uh effectively independent of that now we can actually start talking about changing muscle fiber type so we can change our fibers from a slow twitch fiber to a fast Twi Swit fiber that alone is going to give you more Force production again independent of size fast switch fibers tend to be larger than Soul fibers but not always especially in the presence of endurance training so if you do a lot of consistent endurance training it's very common for us to find solo fibers that are as similar size if not larger often very often larger than the fast TCH fibers if you big slow fibers big slow very metabolically effective fibers so extremely fatigue resistant so it's not a bad thing to call them slow it's like we tend to say fast and slow and SL slow has this negative connotation but it's a quite healthy like fiber type to have um outside of that now we haven't even gotten into things like pen angle so this is the angle at which your muscle fibers interact with your bone so we tend to think about this as like a muscle fiber is pulling on a muscle well some of these are oriented at almost a 90 Dee so a fiber runs perpendicular into the bone and some of them are closer to like a 45° and some of them are closer to almost parallel and that confers a lot of unique mechanical benefits so in one area it's actually going to increase Force production you go the other direction increases velocity and so we have all kinds of changes in the angle at which the muscle inserts into the bone now we're already in the mechanic side of it right so we've we've influenced how effectively it pulls um and with any of these things it's always a give and take so you're going to give up in the case of pation angle you're going to give up strength but you're going to increase Vel shortening velocity or if you want to increase the velocity you're going to give up sort of the strength right um we haven't gotten to any of the energetics at all so we haven't talked about increasing storage of phosphocreatine which is the energy uh system needed to power that muscle contraction at the fastest possible rate so we could continue to go as long as you want here but uh hopefully you're getting the point of a little bit of the of the adaptations that occur um the reason I want to actually why I think that stuff is important to bring it back maybe for some listers I know I took you on a journey there and you're just like what the hell just happened that matters because again this is the specific specific explanation for how is it possible that I got stronger but I didn't get bigger and this is also why strength and hypertrophy are intertwined and are heavily overlapped but are not necessarily the same thing so for example we can increase muscle size and actually reduce strength because of what's called lattice spacing so what happens is um you have to kind of remember your muscle fibers are these long cylinders and the way that they contract requires an optimal space and so what happens is you this molecule called actin and you have this molecule called um mein myosin sits in the middle and there are six actin that surround each individual mein um in a three-dimensional Circle here so you got a A mein in the middle that has all these globular heads and they can reach up and grab an actin and again there's six sort of around them right um well one of the things that can occur is if those those actin are too close together so imagine my hands um I'm I'm reaching out and doing a giant te right so I'm horizontal out there well if my fingertips are the tips of the mein and I'm trying to reach up and grab an actin and I want to pull those actin closer to my face well those actin stack on top of each other and that's what actually makes your muscles grow up like if I flex my bicep it actually you know grows up three or four inches because you're stacking these these ccle mirrors or what they're called on top of each other all right great well if I'm reaching out to grab them and the muscle is stretched too far I can't actually make that strong of a connection it would be like if I reached out grab something but I can only reach my longest fingertip on it when I go to contract I can't make that strong of a contraction because my grip is weak my grip's going to break before I reach my strength limit if I'm too close there's nowhere to go I'm already as close so if you actually disrupt that L of spacing too much you can actually lose a little bit of strength um so it's not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker it's simply that you're not optimizing for strength You're simply optimizing um for size and so that can that can explain a little bit of the of the discontinuity between growing and performance I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is a

when we experience hypertrophy I've heard of protein synthesis yeah changes I'm assuming that's true maybe you can tell us a bit more about that changes in blood flow yep perhaps changes in neural inovation uh who knows maybe even changes in fascia I I'm not aware of any specifically but um I have to imagine that they're somehow involved sure so the when we talk about hypertrophy a lot of the adaptations are going to be similar because the the mode of training is close enough um so your nerves probably aren't smart enough to differentiate between a set of five reps or a set of eight repetitions they're smart enough to differentiate anything like they know everything that's going on U but it's going to be a huge overlap the primary difference with hypertrophy is a couple of things so if you think about the muscle micro structure um I I have a whole series of videos on YouTube if you want to see the visual behind this in fact in there I include the specific diameter size of muscle fibers that I was failed to give you a few minutes ago okay we will provide an an active link to this great so um what happens is this when we talk about and you hear this classic Buzz phrase of muscle protein synthesis generally what we're talking about there is is contractile units and so when we say contractile units we're talking about the meas and and actin and so what we're really trying to do is say okay there's some amount of protein turnover where um we're coming in we're trying to add more proteins to the equation and so what has to happen there is a series of steps so step number one is there has to be some sort of signal from the external World um this could actually often times it's things like stretching of the cell wall which is what happens with exercise right so you're Contracting you're shortening you get this big stretch of the cell wall it can come from as simple things like an amino acid infusion this is just eating protein this is why protein ingestion alone is anabolic right it will help you grow muscle independent of even moving so just eating protein will grow your muscles yeah certainly uh and those those data are are very clear um of course like anything there's a saturation Point uh in terms of total amount you need to get to and and things like that but yeah if you were to walk into a laboratory fasted overnight and I gave you 30 grams of protein we would see a very immeasurable increase in protein synthesis um quite clearly for several hours probably four to five plus hours um we could maybe bring us some people that would know those data better but many hours later with no weight training correct I embedding that most people are not aware of that fact you know what's actually interesting about it is um if you do the exact same study again and you just did strength training you would also see an improvement in protein synthesis right but those factors are independent and the mechanisms are independent such that if you do them both together they stack on top of each other which is really wonderful and if you were to add carbohydrate into that mix now you're actually adding fuel for the the entire M muscle protein synthesis process uh and now you're going to see even added benefits and this is why for so many years uh this is what bore the whole like post exorcize anabolic window thing which is like you got to get carbs and protein in post xraze to maximize um mostly P now that turned out to be like not totally true in terms of the window turned out to not be as strict as people initially uh asserted as I recall but still I think that's super interesting these are parallel Pathways for for protein synthesis simply eating protein um or training each independently increases protein synthesis uh I can't help but ask is the same true if one does end endurance type exercise if I go out for a 45-minute jog um where I can nasal breathe the whole time but if I were to go any faster I would have to kick over into mouth breathing as well so- called Zone 2ish cardio uh will I see an increase in protein synthesis as simply as a consequence of that jog no this is one of uh the unique factors of strength training you're not going to see that in fact you would it's difficult to measure protein breakdown that's been as extraordinarily challenging to do in the laborat but you're not going to see those benefits in fact you're going to see quite the opposite it's it's an entire molecular Cascade um so this is kind of how it works so you have to have some sort of signal on the outside and this can be an energetic signal um so this could be glucose uptake it could be protein intake uh it could be a physical stretch um what happens is on the cell wall there is some sort of it could be testosterone right testosterone combine to Beta adrenic receptors and this activates a whole series of Cascades of signaling proteins and these proteins basic play a game of telephone so one tells the next one they tells the next one and they sort of walk through this entire way well that molecular Cascade is fundamentally the same thing whether regardless of the insult but they're different Pathways and so the pathway from strength training or protein ingestion is going to go to the same nucleus it's going to activate a whole set of Gene Cascades that are going to tell you to to go through this entire process of protein synthesis which I'll walk through without that is in a second if you do endurance training it's a different pathway and so instead of activating this entire thing of like mtor and akt and this this anabolic signaling Cascade it's going to do a different one um which you can think of more of like as amk um and energy signaling things so there's a crossover Point here in fact what one of the things you'll notice is mtor and akt don't really influence mpk but there is some literature that years ago showed mpk will activate another protein called um tsc2 and that will actually inhibit mtor and that was the first molecular explanation for the quote unquote interference effect of endurance training on hypertrophy could you just highlight for people what this is because as you describe these signaling Pathways I just want to um maybe just put a a top Contour explanation the mour pathway is synonymous with cell growth yeah both during development as organisms humans included mature and cells get larger mtor is abundant in the system just to put it quite simply and then the amk pathway and some of the metabolic signaling that you're referring to is more Anonymous with cardiovascular exercise in this at least in the context of this discussion and fuel utilization Y and what you described as a crossover point where certain forms of exercise can tap into both of these yeah but at least for sake of this conversation we're we're largely separating them yeah because the the byproduct is the thing that that matters here so the result of um mtor and akt getting into the nucleus is going to be increased in protein synthesis the result of ampk running down to the m is going to be result in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis so the net outcome is different now I I do want to flag it very quickly this is an extraordinarily complicated thing and um in fact in our laboratory we were able to to be one of the first that figured out how to measure all the different subunits ofk in individual muscles by fiber type so that's because you're ripping people's muscles out of their knees and their patellar tendons uh so just teasing they they're gently removing with under IRB protocol of course um so even when we say something like amk it's not one thing and we say things like mtor it's not one thing either it is you have the total amount that matters you have the activation the activation sites are many of them so it's not as simple um as what I'm laying it out I just want to get a big concept of kind of what's Happening Here to to actually kind of answer your question which is okay so how is the muscle actually grown what you have to understand is is a little bit of how um protein synthesis occurs so what I'm generally meaning is you have a whole bunch of amino acids and this actually goes back to maybe like middle school biology class right so if you take a bunch of amino acids and you combine them together we get these things called a peptide right and if anyone who's ever heard of like peptides that's all it really means you put a bunch of those together you have a poly peptide you put a bunch of those together and we now have a protein so any protein I want to make is going to go through the ex exact same system exact same steps it doesn't matter if that protein is going to be a red blood cell it doesn't matter if that's going to be a hair follicle doesn't matter if it's going to be skeletal muscle that's basically protein synthesis so when we tend to think of protein synthesis we we just paint this picture of growing more muscle and that's not the only thing and so when we talk about the benefits of having highquality muscle is being this place that's going to regulate most of your protein synthesis we tend to lose some people because they're thinking oh I don't need to gain muscle and that's not what we're talking about we're talking about regulating the immune system we're regul we're talking about regulating any protein turnover so any Protein that's degradated or needs to be broken down in your in your system at all autophagy this is the like this is such an important buzzword um that's just protein breakdown of of an unneeded or or damaged protein right that whole thing is going to go through protein synthesis to be able to come back and replace the things the only reason you go through autophagy is so you can clean that garbage out and then come back and build in a more properly functioning protein so it's not just about growing more muscle mass it's why you want these systems to be operating well so the protein ingestion is going to just activate that Cascade because it's basically saying oh hey look we have an abundance of Supply here why don't we make something out of it because we don't know the next time this thing is going to be around um carbohydrates and fat are very easy to store protein is very challenging it's more transient and so you can store some of it and keep it around but most of it you're going to lose and so when it's a available your your body wants to act very quickly it doesn't necessarily care if you have extra fat floating around in your system it's all right let's just package it up and store we can easily bring this back out but if you got protein around you're going to want to use it and so that's why it alone will activate and increase protein synthesis um independent of exercise so those effects are additive like I said because that signaling process is independent and once you hit a rate limiting phase then it you are you're there but at its onset those things will work independently okay so that being said what is skeletal muscle hypertrophy in general we think about it as this increas in contracti protein so those myosin and actin eff effectively get thicker okay now what happens is since they are thicker and as I talked about a second ago that influences and actually hurts the L of spacing and so what your body does as a result is say hey let's increase the diameter of the entire cell so that we can maintain our spacing between these things right it's effectively like if if you know the two of us were sitting in this room and you doubled in size and I was like whoa you're in my personal space like and I doubl in size now we're in each other space the at some point we just have to make the room larger and that's exactly what's happening in the cell and so as you can continue to increase muscle size you're going to muscle my fi accretion you're going to continue to increase muscle fiber size for years there was this other comment about um nonfunctional hypertrophy and this is often called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy now this is not sarop particul this is a fancy way of saying my muscle is larger but it has no function and the question would be well how the hell is that possible if I have more contractile units and I can make more of these cross Bridges perform more of these power strokes this is what these contractions are called how could I possibly be losing function well that was challenged for that was broscience for a very very long time in fact where it really came down to was are there different types of hypertrophy training some that induce contracti protein hypertrophy and some that induce the sarcoplasmic hypy and that was significantly challenged and tell recently Mike Roberts did at Auburn did a series of wonderful studies that showed quite clearly that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is probably happening um and in fact there's probably a pretty easy explanation in general what happens is it is it is a increase in fluid uh in the muscle fiber and so this would allow for the diameter to be larger but since there's no addition of contractile units no more Force production happen happens and so he actually has a wonderful review paper I believe it's open access where you can go look and he created a wonderful graph um I think that's in in my hypertophy videos on YouTube as well and you can actually see that it's likely happening in phasic changes throughout your training experience so at the beginning of your training but as as the years and year or weeks rather than months and then eventually years go by in your training we have a change in the hypertrophy that's coming from uh contractile units versus ccop plastic um so I think that is it's an important note because again people are wondering like well how the hell is it even possible for me to get larger muscle and somehow I'm not stronger well if it came from Simply fluid retention and this is not bloating this is not there's no negative really to this it is simply um holding of of more hydration in the cell the Amor gets larger and then everything works that way what you just described calls to mind something similar in the nervous system which is neuroplasticity which of course is the nervous system's ability to change in response to learning and experience and damage for that matter yep and we think about it as one term but there are many different forms of neuroplasticity yeah uh a discussion that we don't need to get into now but there Spike timing dependent plasticy and ltp and long-term depression which has nothing to do with psychological depression and on and impaired pulse facilitation and on and on and on and short-term plasticity and so what I'm starting to understand is that there are many paths to what we call strength increase and there are many paths to what we think of as hypertrophy many of these are going to operate in parallel it's going to be rare that any one of them is going to be active alone Y in order to create hypertrophy or strength changes and that certain forms of exercise and certain ways of doing exercises in terms of sets and repetition schemes and rest intervals between sets and between training sessions are going to tap into different mechanisms but also overlapping sets of mechanisms which is why if I understand correctly you mentioned at the beginning that often not always often strength increases are associated with some hypertrophy changes and hypertrophy increases are often not always associated with strength increases do I have that right correct and the beauty of this whole thing is while we don't yet know the mechanisms specifically and there's a lot of Confusion And there's a lot of changes that happen there's a we actually just submitted a paper a few days ago um myself uh Jimmy baggley at San Francisco and Kevin mck at one has a wonderful muscle physiology Lab at Arkansas and we we we actually this is a very lay article actually it's incredibly easy to read um we describe the the role of my nucleation in uh muscle hyper and there's actually a lot of interesting stuff we can get into there but um we we're learning more and more about it uh as a quick example so skeleton muscle is unique in the fact that it is so large in diameter it's also unique in the fact it's multinucleated what that means is um typically in biology you see like a cell has one nucleus that's the place that houses and holds the DNA and it's a control center does it to grow shrink die repair that whole thing well skeletal muscle in human is awesome because it has thousands if not more of those nuclei which gives it that plasticity and so a normal cell has one place it has to go to for any time it wants to up regulate down regulate do whatever the thing is your muscle fibers have these little control centers all throughout them and for years we were like okay great the amount of hypertrophy that you can experience is probably limited by the amount of nuclei you have because you're not going to exceed a certain size of muscle fiber if that's going to mean you lose control and so we're like okay great we found and identified a limiting factor to what will determine how much a muscle can actually grow and then the next question was and then where are these things coming from and and this is where satellite cells came in and so was very clear a satellite cell that's lying dormant sort of on the outside the periphery of the fiber will then go in um into the into the Fibber will turn into a my nuclei and then it can actually you know increase your diameter like that and so then actually it was like hey hey you're actually limited by the amount of these satellite cells you can get in and turn into nuclei and then what the evidence came out that showed hey what if you detrain so what if I used to lift weights like a long time ago and I got big but now I've lost a lot of my muscle if I train again you actually get that muscle back faster than it took you the very first time to build it like that's what we call muscle memory like in our now on your side of the equation muscle memory is something different right it's a neur when people talk about muscle memory um like the ability to ride a bicycle after so many years of not having tried to ride one that's actually largely independent of the muscle it has something to do with the muscle it's it's basically a nervous system phenomenon so muscle memory uh has been co-opted uh by different communities to mean different things on our side muscle memory is going to mean that ability to remember that muscle size right that Hy because as you explained the motor control thing is it's a totally a nerve thing this is the one I'll give you this one you guys the nerve people can have this one well it seems to me that there are a tremendous number of parallels between strength and hypertrophy changes and neuroplasticity this is coming up again and again in this conversation um because we know for instance that if you are exposed to a couple of different languages early on in life you will learn any number of different languages far more easily later in life and that's because there's some crossover between different languages especially Latin based languages that allows for that there's a substrate for it it's similar to the the ability to hop on a bicycle again phenomenon or play an instrument phenomenon but it's broader than that and again I think this speaks to the huge number of different adaptive changes that are occurring in the cells and in the nerves that inate these cells when one experiences increases in strength and hypertrophy so to to round that out um and to go back to what I was saying there what we're actually learning now is that nucleation thing and by the way this entire trajectory of story is probably over the last like 8 years like this is how fast we've changed our understanding of how muscle grows uh the copos culum thing five years ago was was broscience now it's it's pretty well established the M nucleation thing was 8 to 10 years ago it's changing every week this paper we just submitted this week showed actually um why we had generally thought a few years ago and in fact you can find me on podcasts and probably in some of my videos talking about this and I'm going to tell you right now those things are wrong like we've just had new things come out in these last couple years where that draining effect we thought was a reason of well what happens is if you had the muscle before and you brought in these nuclei and they differentiated and turned into into a nuclei and then the muscle got small again you preserved those nuclei and that's why when you go to train again they were already around so the muscle grows faster the second time than it did the first time well now that looks like that's actually not the case in fact it's actually probably H what's happening is it's a it's a epigenetic change um in the nuclei's ability to access the DNA needed to grow muscle it's effectively the analogy we used it's the nuclei are remembering how to ride a bike so it's quite funny that you said that because it's not really necessarily that they're being preserved over time they have learned the sequence it takes to grow the protein there and it goes it happens faster the second time and we've also learned that there are specific nuclei we've known this for actually a while we found this in our lab we didn't Discover it we just we saw this in in our sum of our HS but there are different shapes the nuclei some are more oval some are more elongated and the shape determines a lot of the function some of them are hanging out more towards the periphery and some of them are hanging out right around the nucleus well it looks like there's actually probably different types of nuclei um a lot of them that are specific to the mitochondria in fact you can see like on some of the Imaging we have we just like they're just packed around the the the m Andria and there are some that are probably specific to injury repair and so this is probably explaining a lot of the the individual variation I mean I know you've You' said previously like you're just a very you're very slow at recovering there's a lot of things that go into that and I would I would love to walk through sort of all the buckets uh maybe later into recovery but one of the inherent genetic variations is could be simply that you maybe have more or less of the nuclei responsible for tissue repair um that's something that's been happening the last like handful of months that's been coming coming out we'll see if that holds up is true or not um so as we're learning more and more almost every day about muscle physiology what's super fun and interesting and I think the most exciting what to do inms in terms of like how to train and how to eat and how to do everything else to get these adaptations has been pretty well established for a long long long time we're just figuring out how like what's happening in the muscle now but we know what to do so from a practical standpoint putting together protocols um for any outcome that you want or don't want for any modality you don't have a gym you have uh weights you have dumbbells only you only have kettle bells you don't want to you only use body weight we can you only have three days a week you have seven days a week you want to maximize muscle growth you want to get a Little Bit Stronger any of these variables you want to throw at me um we have a large evidence base for exactly how to get those adaptations and not others so um while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms the physiology um we have pretty good legs to stand on in terms of what to do to get whatever adaptations you want so what are the essential components of an effective strength and hypertrophy protocol okay so what I would like to actually do is is walk you through both of those because as we mentioned before they overlap uh but the training needs to be differentiated so that you can optimize either strength hypertrophy or if you actually want you can get a combination of both this allows you to then get the adaptation you want avoid ones you don't want and then get it even a combination if that's the preference so a lot of people will talk about I want to get a little stronger I want to add some muscle that's a different answer than someone who wants to truly maximize muscle which is a different answer from somebody who maximizes wants to maximize strength which is a different answer from somebody who wants to maximize strength but not actually gain muscle so we have all these combinations what's important to understand before we get into the details is a couple of things number one we we've been teasing this concept so far of the concepts are few but the methods are many and so I want to hit those Concepts right now these are um as you as you say these are the non-negotiables that have to happen in any training program and I'm going to referring to these in the strength and hypy conversation but these are true of power development speed development muscular endurance uh endurance any other thing these are things that just have to happen for any training program to work I mentioned one uh a little bit earlier which was adherence and so that my um frequent collaborator Dan Garner will constantly say consistency Beats intensity um again in fact the literature will show you very clearly in herin um is the number one predictor of physical fitness outcome so we want to do something that you will engage in will you'll put effort into and you'll be able to repeat consistently over time so that's number one the second one is and this is a major reason that people don't hit their fitness goals in fact I would argue outside of not doing it the number one mistake they make is Progressive overload so I'm going to walk you through through exactly how much you should be increasing um your sets and Reps and weight Etc per week per month later but that's the biggest thing you have got to have some sort of overload the body works as an adaptation mechanism right so in fact um we we talked previously about the harvor fatigue lab and one of the things actually people don't realize is the concept of homeostasis is actually comes from research at the harbard fatigue lab it was um work that they did on an endurance Runner I forget name and they sort of realized that after a long period of time working out this is an acute exercise spout the body actually comes back to some stable place despite the fact he was continuing to work and that's exactly what bore the phrase steady state uh and that actually then they launched off they said wow there's this state that the body wants to be in and we'll call this homeostasis so that those all Concepts came out of exercise physiology which is really really cool right um we don't get a lot of love a lot of times scientifically but that's a good one that we took so why that all matters is we have got to achieve some sort of overload without uh going excess so we'll cover that later of exactly what to do and we'll get potentially get into overtraining and monitoring and maning things like that but you have to have some sort of consistent predictable overload that's what's going to cause adaptation to continue to cause stress if you don't do that you can still do things like burn calories you can still get some of the other benefits of exercise like improved mood cognitive function Etc ET flexibility increased es all those can happen without a progressive overload but if you want to see these gains in strength and hypertrophy you really need to progressively overload so that's concept number two the third one here um is is going to be individualization and this is when we can get into things like personal preference you know equipment availability you have kettle bells or dumbbells or you only have bands or you have none of that um these are all smaller details but that's an important component to it the last one I really want to get into is picking the appropriate Target and we went through this when we talked about the fitness protocol and and if you run through something like that and you run some testing and figure out where your biggest limitations are that's going to help you identify where you need to go um so if you can do all those things you're going to be in a good spot to balance specificity and variation all right so if you want to make sure you grow your biceps you better make sure your biceps are working having said that if you over rely on specificity you're going to increase the likelihood of overuse injuries which is going to come back and actually hamper consistency over time all right so this is when hedging towards specificity is important but too much can cause a problem if you go the other direction and you go too much variation so imagine you're just sort of doing all kinds of different exercises every time you you work out that's actually not enough stimuli directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern if you're wanting to learn a new movement um to get you very far and so this is a classic problem of I'm doing a lot of work but I don't have a very clear Direction I lack specificity so I'm working but I'm not seeing a lot of improvements and this is like in the business worlds Etc this is like doing a whole bunch of different things means you get nothing really done so that's the game we're going to play here right how do we overload this stuff how do we make sure we're balancing specificity and variation how do we make sure I want to do this and then how do I individualize it for my needs and circumstances and and movement restrictions and time availability and my calendar and desires and all these things so those are the concepts we absolutely have to hit the methods that we choose run across a handful of variables and we call these things modifiable variables because as you modify them or you make different choices within these variables you get different outcomes or adaptations this is exactly what determines the nine adaptations that we've been talking about so the way that I like to say this is extra exercises do not determine adaptation so you can't simply go I want to get stronger therefore I'm going to choose these exercises that's not how it works what determines adaptation is the execution of the exercises so a deadlift is my favorite example a deadlift is a common um example that people think of when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise but a deadlift will not increase your strength unless you're executing it in the proper fashion I'm not only talking about technique here I'm talking about these modifiable variables the same thing for power exercises we'll commonly see mistakes of doing uh activities like a box jump which is great people think oh I'm going to get improve my power which we know is extremely highly correlated to um activities of daily living and particularly living unassisted as you age right is reduction of power so they'll do an activity like a box jump what they're failing to realize is unless you do it powerfully you won't actually increase power um if you don't move fast you won't get faster so the the the way that we manipulate these variables is everything to determining the adaptation you get or again don't get so with that Foundation I think we can kind of run right into these things uh and we can start off with perhaps speed and power and what what I would like to do is walk you through all those modifiable variables uh what to do with them and then hit you with as many different methodologies as as we really have time for uh and then we'll move on to strength and hypertrophy and kind of round the entire thing out and then maybe at the end we can talk some other variables like what happens if uh I have a training protocol and I'm halfway through it and I can't finish my workout what should I do reduce my weight or reduce my duration or things like that so there's lots of what if scenarios that we can go through that potentially uh a lot of people listening have questions about so sound like a plan sounds like a plan I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to do with that information inside tracker makes no what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are of course but then also what sorts of Behavioral dos and don'ts what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can visit insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insidetracker comom huberman to get 20% off so just to interrupt briefly and make sure that I and everybody else have in mind the proper nine adaptations that we've been referring to and that were discussed in detail in episode one I have listed number one skill and technique number two speed number three power which is speed times Force number four strength number five hypertrophy number six muscular endurance number seven anerobic capacity number eight maximal aerobic capacity and number nine long duration steady state exercise yep you nailed it thank you for for that it was probably important clarification for everybody um so that being said let's jump right into to speed and power now I'll do these a little bit simultaneously uh they are different if you're a high performance athlete you really need to separate these two things for the most people though we can probably think about them is is the same thing there's not a lot of pure speed training that the general public is is interested in um if you want to actually further breakdown speed there are multiple components there's acceleration there's top end velocity there's change of direction or agility things like that so we'll just kind of call All That speed and power for now now at the onset there's this three to five concept that that we talked about uh many times where this is really fairly true for speed power or strength now I I didn't develop the 3 to five it's just an easy way to help help you remember one concept that will run true across all these things so 3 to five refers to three to five days per week uh pick three to five exercises and you're going to do three to five repetitions per set you'll do three to five sets and you'll rest three to five minutes U between each set if you do that and you execute any of the exercises that you choose at a high intent and that part is critical you don't get faster by moving kind of fast you can't improve Power by moving like eh powerfully you have to be trying regardless of whether you're actually moving faster or not anytime you're talking about speed or power you're by definition using sub maximal weights so you're going to be able to lift it that's not the question the question is how fast can you lift that Implement and so intention is incredibly important so if you do that the same for strength by the way so if you land on that that allows you to run the gamut from as little as three days a week you're doing a three exercises you're do three sets of three which is a very very low volume it's a a very low amount of days easy to handle all the way to five sets of five of five exercises five days a week so it it's again it's just one sample that's something easy to remember and is quite effective for a very long time and this has been um tested quite extensively in in both the coaching Realms as well as the scientific Realms to be um quite productive and and easy to follow and grasp if you do that all you need to do is slightly increase the load um or the volume but mostly the load over time and the number we want to look for there is something like a 3 to 5% increase per week uh so an example would be if you're going to do an exercise at 100 lb you can't necessarily just add 5 PBS every week that's going to catch up to you pretty quickly and so you may have to run some a smaller increment uh if you're doing like a lower body exercise where you might have a couple of hundred pounds on the weight you can probably get away with adding five pounds because it's still a a low percentage of the total load so um that's roughly uh the guide that we want to get to for speed power and strength so that sounds incredibly simple and effective yet I have a number of questions sure first off if somebody is using the 3 to5 approach does that mean they should not be doing any any other weight training of any kind in those workouts or at all no you you can certainly do that in combination with anything else you would like especially if you think about speed and power those are very nonfatiguing and so if you could imagine uh you're going to go to the beach and you're going to take a 10 lb to 20 lb medicine ball with you and you're going to do you know four different exercises where you're throwing the medicine ball as high as you can in the air four times in a row taking a break and you do two or three HS that you do maybe three or four different types of throws um that's very good for improving power extremely good but it's not very fatiguing so you could certainly finish that workout in 20 minutes and then run on and then do any number of other things so you could do um some high-intensity anerobic capacity work you could do steady state stuff you could you could even do hypertrophy on top of that so there's a there's um two major categories of what we call periodization there's there's many many many of them but the two that have the most scientific literature are what's called linear periodization and another is called undulating or often daily undulating periodization and I'm flagging these two again despite the fact there are many many many more because they represent two different concepts what you actually just touched upon so linear periodization is a hallmarked by basically saying we're going to train one adaptation at a time so imagine going say six to eight weeks and you're only doing strength or you're only doing hypertrophy or endurance for that matter so in that particular case you you would not do anything else in combination if you contrast that to undulating periodization you would actually be doing multiple different styles of training e with either within the same day or just different days so it could be Monday is power Wednesday is strength Friday is hypertrophy whatever or it could be a little bit of strength every single day a little bit of hypertrophy every day a little bit of power every day and you would just change the amount of each that you do within the day to alter the emphasis all right now if you look at the studies and there have been many uh rcts on this the result of both of these training programs is generally basically the same thing they are equally effective here's the major difference though one if your goal is very specific to one outcome you want to hedge towards specificity so if you're like hey I'm trying to maximize the amount of muscle I can build in the next 8 weeks then you don't really anything else else besides that is just distraction and potential interference does it really matter or not doesn't matter but it's not helping anything else so linear periodization is is fundamental at providing focus and therefore the the adaptations tend to be um oftentimes larger in that specific area the downside is you now go six to 8 to 10 weeks of doing nothing else and so you are losing those other adaptations at a great at a faster rate uh and you can imagine doing something like speed work only again speed work by definition is non- fatiguing so when often times we think of speed work it's like oh I did ladder drills and I did all these things and like I threw up at the end but that's not speed work you just did a different type of endurance training okay which is great and important so true speed work is very high rest very low fatigue and actually truly trying to reach a new level of speed or velocity so non- fatiguing if you did that exclusively for 10 weeks you would be pretty unfit by the end of it because you did you would also lose a decent amount of muscle mass not because there's an interference effect but simply because of the fact you have not stimulated muscle growth for 8 to 10 weeks and so neither one of these is better than the other we're going to see this classically across all uh program design or periodization strategies is it's just a it's a given tick there are tons of different systems and and perhaps at the end we can talk about some of the more advanced periodization Styles um these ones are are both effective um you could do these with beginners you could do these with Advanced athletes you can do them any of the spectrum but they're they're some of the the more well documented ones it's just a pro and con game right it's what are you willing to give up the way that you solve that problem is going back to that fitness assessment and your analysis and really truly understanding what your goal is uh is your goal to do a little bit of strength and a little about okay great maybe undulated periodization is an approach if your goal is really to maximize strength and maybe you can wait on putting some muscle mass on maybe linear periodization is a better approach or another style of periodization that's optimal for strength gain so it's just simply about addressing your things one of the major problems folks have in addition to lacking Progressive overload is they don't have any foresight past the next day of the training right and so it's really important that you set off um blocks that are anywhere between six to 12 weeks long where you're going to have a specific plan ideally you have an idea for the whole year I actually have like a structure I could walk you through uh for that but even if you don't have that really think about what you want the next 12 weeks and then maybe the next 12 weeks after that and that's going to give you a lot of guidance about what to do and what to focus on terrific what about warming up I was taught that one should do higher repetition movements with lighter weights in order to warm up and then one of the things that did make a big positive difference for me in terms of strength and hypertrophy training was to do um a moderate repetition warm-up with a fairly lightweight but then to actually keep the number of warmup repetitions fairly low and work progressively toward the first so-called work set when you say three to five that's three to five work sets correct yep are you also going to tell me three to five warm-ups no are you also going to tell me it has to be done between 300 and 5:00 p.m. uh so in terms of friends in all seriousness what does a good warm-up look like and I realize this will vary depending on how cool your training environment is time of day Etc but as a kind of umbrella for a good warmup okay what should people do the you've already sort of jumped the gun with with my answer it it is honestly very dependent upon the person so some folks respond very well to a minimum more others I've had lots of actually um professional fighters I've worked with where the I actually have a major league baseball player right now he's one of the best P pitchers in the game probably the best and the longer we warm up the better his numbers get we actually did a vertical jump test with him he's going to kill me cuz he got so mad uh I wanted to see how long it sort of took him to reach a peak vertical jump and most times this takes people something like five to 10 sort of reps um and I said take it up all the way to a maximum vertical jump and then what I want you to do is continue to Jumping until you have three consecutive jumps where you're down lower than 90% And so I what we're trying to look at is sort of when is he going to break because in baseball he's going to throw like a 100 pitches or so and we're trying to figure out when is his Peak velocity on his fast as while going to drop and sort of Bas his conditioning on that so it's a different style of conditioning it's power endurance is really what it is um he called me in the middle of it I'm like oh done whatever and he's just like no like how many of these am I supposed to do and I was like what are you talking about he's like I'm on rep 130 or something and I was like what and I'm like what rep did you peek on he peaked on rep 70 something like that 69 I think technically because he's goofy um so he's a classic example I've worked him for many many years we have a ton of on him a ton of biological data a ton of um neuromuscular stuff like all kinds of stuff and it just the more he warms up an absurd amount of warm-up the better he gets and the better he gets in power production and the better he gets in speed and velocity so his warmup prior to games is it's totally absurd uh and just the more volume we throw at him the better he does I have other folks you get past like two or three reps and fatigue starts to set in and now you're actually like reducing power production so there is a ton of variation that goes in that I can give you some guidelines though you need to differentiate if you're training for speed power strength or a pery here's why if we understand a little bit about what's causing the adaptation that's going to tell you what you need to do or avoid for example volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy intensity is the primary driver in speed power and strength all right what so what that means is you need to preserve intensity for the first three you need to preserve volume and the second one at most so if your warmup is so ex extensive in the hypertrophy training that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise then you're actually probably walking yourself backwards by doing that extensive you would have been better off starting your first working set slightly suboptimal right because it's not really you're just trying to acove volume at that point strength and power is the opposite until you're moving very very fast or power you're not really causing the adaptation so there's no pony starting your working set until you're really basically at 100% so the warm-up should be as long as it takes you to get to where your Mobility is in the right spot like your joints feel good you feel fresh you feel activated and you really feel Peak power anything before that is a warm up set in the sport of Olympic weightlifting um a lot of times the coaches will measure barbell velocity Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this he's got a lot of data on what's called velocity based training Brian man at Missouri and and Miami tons of work here and generally those communities are not going to count any repetition as a working set until you exceed 70% of your one rep max where that's changed because of a lot of people doing the velocity based stuff is now they're basing that simply on an achieved velocity and so really the warm-up is irrelevant they don't even P it's sort of just like do whatever you want and we're going to measure the barbell until you actually hit an outcome and now you're at where a working set um so different ways to think about it um depending on what you're training for that'll give you a little bit of a guideline if you're training for anything past hypertrophy then really and especially even hypertrophy it just comes down to are you feeling um ready to work are you cold are you moving through the correct positions and if all those things are fine I don't care if you start a little bit early and save some gas the end of especially if you're a person like you who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly uh relative to Trevor who's just has no response to fatigue whatsoever is it useful to do more warmup at the beginning of a workout say before the first exercise and then once one has achieved both local and systemic warmup in air quotes um then perhaps on the second or third exercise fourth exercise Etc one or maybe even zero warm-ups yeah fair point we generally think about warm-ups in a couple of ways this is a really actually this is a very clever question you want to have some sort of General Global warm-up scheme U we tend to prefer Dynamic warm-ups so this is whole body movements rather than like sitting and stretching uh static stretching things like that so so something that involves momentum yeah momentum or movement right so this is like um think about this in like old gym class it's like your high knees and and your butt kickers and just different things like that where you're moving in different planes um you're moving joints through through tons of range of motion you're you're getting a lot of movement there so you're getting the local warmup you're also getting the the total systemic activation everything else is going on there so that is what we consider to be a general warmup five minutes is a very sufficient number perhaps 10 if you're a slow goer achy and some things like that and you really got to get the ankle warmed up if you're doing lower body stuff really make sure that that's moving correctly the hips and knees will follow um upper body stuff really get the shoulder blades and the neck like making sure you're going there and the elbows will follow after that um so five to seven minutes of a general warmup a lot of the times like classic exercise science it will even just put you on a bike cycling for five minutes I don't like that personally um Dynamic movement is more preferred if you really just move for 5 to seven minutes you'll be fine there now specificity within each movement it's very important that your first exercise of the day is generally the thing youve prioritize that's often times the most important you're going to do for it often times is also the most complex and the most moving parts so it tends to be multi-joint it tends therefore you need to have um movement precision and skill dialed right you don't typically start your workouts off with a forearm curl right like that's you don't need a tremendous amount of warm-up to get going on that you're going to start off with medicine ball throws or a snatch or some agility work you you need to have the whole system going because multiple joints are moving position matters technique there's just a lot of skill requirement Etc so the individualized workout um or the specific workout for the specific movement for that very first one my general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes to move perfect in that first exercise past that you don't necessarily need to do individualized warm-ups for your next movements unless it is a movement you're trying to learn or just even get a little bit better at like drop the load a little bit work on some uh acre some practice reps fantastic or it's another dissimilar complex movement so let's say your first exercise was a front squat and you got loaded for that and now you're going to move into a pull-up but your mechanics aren't the best there and so you really need to change and do some maybe more specific activation warm-ups for that or something else or it's running or or something totally different so yeah you don't need to rewarm up for every single exercise as you go generally once you're good to go um the same muscles that you're going to use in the next exercise are warm same joints then you're good to go you talked about intent within the movement what about specific cadences for repetitions yeah I was taught that one should lower the weight slowly the so-called Ecentric portion of the movement and then to try and explode the weight through the concentric phase and then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form yeah as it were now of course that is one tiny slice of the possible rep cadences yeah and ways to approach resistance training although I think it's a pretty good one yeah what are the general parameter sets that one needs to consider you could imagine lifting you know 4 seconds concentric pause for one pause for two Ecentric I realize there's an infinite number of variations here yeah but is there a way to use rep Cadence repetition Cadence that is as a way to work through weak points um and to be strong in every position of the movement yeah a lovely question I think the the way I would like to answer this is maybe going back just a touch to get directly to that so I think if we walk through Power strength and hypertrophy and I hit you with the concepts that are specific to each one that's going to lay out your answer because the most true answer there is it's depends on the goal um the answer for what is optimal for strength is diametrically opposed for potentially what's optimized for pery the same exact thing can be said for momentum so we've classically heard things like this um you know don't bounce at the bottom um you're cheating right so if you're doing a lap pull down or something you know you don't you don't bounce and rebound you don't um you know you stop at the bottom slow down all these things are thought to be truisms of strength conditioning but guess what those are all true isms assuming we're trying to grow muscle and that's that actually goes back to our conversation and in episode one about a lot of the things we think are just fundamental truths about strength training are just fundamental truths that came from the bodybuilding world and they're not wrong they're good ideas but there are other adaptations one needs to get from strength training that are not just maximizing muscle growth so what I will lay out to you is a case for which you should bounce a case for when you should go fast as case for when you should be under control um all these things are are different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for it is there a way that you could lay out for us optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically versus hypertrophy specifically just to sort of bookend the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of rep cadences that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both we can get pretty close yeah so when you're talking about strength versus hypertrophy remember strength is movement hypertrophy is muscle size that's that's the key to your answer here so when you're trying to get stronger what you're effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of force the movement okay now force is mass times acceleration so what's the mass in the bar multiplied by how well I can accelerate it intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration right so it's hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength because you're simply reducing acceleration so you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate now does that mean if you're trying to get stronger there are no phases of your training in which you'll slow down or POS no of course not there are certain rules in different organizations where you have to the bottom of a like there there's all kinds of little things like there but in general we want to think about what are we trying to do here we're trying to get better at moving a heavier mass at a faster rate of acceleration that is more force that is more strength hypertrophy is not that the goal here is not a functional outcome it is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy and when you get to hyper then your optimal Cadence is up to you you can do any combination in fact you could do it the same exact Cadence that you did your strength training with and get the same adaptations as hyper if you modify the other variables appropriately or you could go slower or you could do pauses or you could do a a thing that is uh called triphasic training where you spend the first phase several weeks of your training where you do Ecentric only so you're just lowering the bar you're basically stopping you can then do the next phase of your training which is isometrics you're just holding at that bottom position and then the next phase you're training you're focusing on the concentric portion of it right triphasic 1 two 3 Ecentric isometric concentric so that's a fantastic way of of developing actually strength a little bit of hypertrophy but you're manipulating the variables in terms of how you execute the repetition range you can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy moving the weight fast as you mentioned even down slow into control now one thing one will never Advocate is moving any sort of weight or load uncontrolled the Assumption here what I'm saying go fast is you're always in control I never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum with a barbell Off Your Dust but you you can move at a lot of rates you can um the isometric I mentioned because this is when things like body weight training come into play absolutely you can gain strength and even a little bit of hypertrophy especially in the upper body doing isometrics is much harder to do this with the lower body um you just you just you outrun that coverage really quickly you need load um but there's a lot of ways this is also probably why people have done things like gone to yoga only or Pilates or some of these things that are body weight based and there's no external load and they've actually increased muscle size so I'm getting the picture there are a ton of options in terms of rep cadences however can we say that one should pick a given rep Cadence within an exercise rather than changing it from set to set within an exercise or that one should perhaps even pick a certain rep Cadence for an entire workout I'm suspecting that your answer is going to be it depends yeah it is but if you know I'm not going to use the if you had a gun to your head kind of situation but if you had a gun to your head what would be the rep Cadence that you would prescribe yeah for strictly strength or as much strength with as little hypertrophy as possible and in picking that rep Cadence then it therefore has to thread throughout the entire yeah exercise bout so you're actually right you can because of that undulating periodization stuff I talked about you can actually do this in a lot always so you could do one exercise at the beginning where you have a set Cadence say a 311 is like a very one so that's cons so that's Lifting for three pause for one lower for one uh generally the opposite okay so the first number is always the Ecentric generally okay soow lowering the the weight for a count of three pause for one it totally depends on the exercise like a deadlift starts concentric and finishes Ecentric but a bench press starts the opposite so it start to finish start to finish is better way to think about it yeah so in I'll clarify actually when we say 311 we're generally talking about almost always the Ecentric is the slower portion regardless if it's the first or the last right so whether you're doing a bench press where the Ecentric is lowering the bar to your chest that's the first part of the movement one two three pause one one up which means accelerate as hard as you can on the way up that's what you describe right as opposed to say a row a row which is actually going to be starting off off concentric so you're going to be pulling that thing to your chest as fast as you can under control not slamming off your chest holding for one second and then taking 3 seconds to lower it back on the rack or on the ground or whatever so the reason we do that is is somewhat intuitive but it is again to make sure you're not advancing a bar or an Implement onto your physical body at an extremely fast rate that that's very difficult to to deal with so a 311 is a very standard um strength protocol that is something you can just run with if if that's all you ever wanted to do it'd be absolutely fine lower the bar for a count of three it actually ends up being approximately three because hardly anybody is counting off seconds precisely I mean it's I suppose it's doable but then pausing briefly yep and that brief is almost uh that pause is almost um unmeasurable it is simply are you under control before you transition from the Ecentric to concentric conent each it's just a safety thing so once you feel down you've reached complete range of motion you're ready to transition then just go you don't really need to go like thousand one and then go up it's just making sure again we don't slam weights off of body parts and that final one in the 311 is the execution of the usually concentric portion of of the exercise yep as fast as you possibly can okay so that would be for the majority of the outcome being strength yep okay and of course we should acknowledge again there are a ton of variations that one could Implement there but that that would be a good starting place on the opposite side for somebody who's mainly interested in hypertrophy Y what would be the rep Cadence that um if you had a gun to your head that you would prescribe I would probably do the exact same thing but I would like I would make the last number two so 3 one two you could also just keep 311 it is still very fine um even exploding on the Contra is still highly effective for training hypertrophy so if you wanted to keep it super simple and just make rep Cadence not a variable that you play with because you have other ones to move that's great if you want to add a little bit of time to the concentric phase fine it's not going to do it's not going to make enough of a difference for most people for you to really worry about I guess that's sort of the point I really want to make this is we're classically this is a classic example of we're deep into a method right if you long as you hit the concepts I talked about earlier whether you want to do 311 323 333 triphasic things this is just a method choice that doesn't mean they're irrelevant they are there are subtle changes within them it's just 8020 rule right so 80% of the benefit is going to be from the concept 20% is this small thing if you're super into this field or you actually want to work with a qualified certified coach or something they there's lots of reasons to play with this if you're just on your own here and running this thing 311 is fine 312 totally fine anything like that um you really just want to make sure that in the strength side of the equation you're under control and you can add enough load to stimulate strength and not get hurt with an acute trauma right on the hypertrophy side you're just wanting to load enough to where you can hit volume because you got to put a lot on there so if you want to go lighter if you want to go slower fine you if you go slower in your repetition so maybe even like a five SEC second Ecentric a 2cond pause a 3second rise that's great you can actually then stimulate the same amount of hypertrophy and either do it with less weight or do it with less repetitions so it's a variable you can play with if you're like hey I don't have enough weights at my house or I only have a kettlebell or a dumbbell how am I going to stimulate hypertrophy your only option is really doing more reps well eventually that that train runs pretty shallow okay here's the thing you can play with maybe just add time under tension is what we're calling right um just you know do slower repetitions go longer ones and hold this so it's a variable that we use to individualize programs rather than something that you should really be focused on as like a core aspect that's going to be driving whether or not your program works it's just a tool we can play with in the what if scenarios um I will use this stuff a lot when I'm traveling you can do a tremendous workout in your hotel room just doing like a 10-second Ecentric a 10-second hold a 10- Centric concentric yeah I've had some decent hotel room workouts they're not my preference but um by simply doing things like um 10c lowering uh handstand push-up against the door totally um obviously assisted for me I don't I can't do a free hand stand push-up um I I just don't have the skill or the strength or both um you can do some sort of configure dips between the beds or chairs and this kind of thing um elevated split squats are great to do in hotels put your back foot up on a on a bed and get a an amazing split squat workout done yeah glute Bridges lots of stuff you can do there yeah and with a jump rope if you ever heard someone jumping in the in the morning uh yeah um it may or may not have been me it could be any number of things but I am known to skip R uh in hotel rooms um not to get overly detailed but I think there are going to be a number of people wondering about how to breathe during repetitions and how to breathe in between sets so I'd like to just briefly touch on this and this is something that I know we're going to return to again when we have our discussion about recovery yeah but is there a general rule of thumb for how to breathe during repetitions during work y for strength maybe even strength versus hypertrophy in in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system you know keeps you uh alert and conscious but that also protects the body by creating some rigidity in the system right because certainly being def with all your air exhaled the body is a very different beast in terms of stability than with the body full of air versus you know breathing during the repetition movement there's a a maneuver that has long been uh labeled the Vol Salva technique so what that really means is you're trying to use air to create intraabdominal pressure and what you're really trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine the real issue you have to to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability now you should be able to breathe and Brace what I mean by that is you should be able to create total intraabdominal pressure regulate uh spine control while breathing it's just very hard for a lot of people to do it's it's a skill you should absolutely work on um you can actually you can do this and you can go around like I do this trick in class and students can come and like push any part um of my entire abdomen is super tight and I can talk now it's going to be a little bit labored you can hear a little bit of a difference but you should be able to do that if you have to like hunch down and you can't even muster a breath and it takes that to create pressure you're not actually um you don't really understand the abdominal control necessary to create that stability so step number one is that's the goal now with the blood pressure thing we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure uh ideally if we sat around right now is probably something like 120 over 80 systolic versus diastolic that's a normal number right high blood pressure is something over that well with an acute bout of exercise you can see that number reaches high as like 450 over 350 which effectively means you have total blood occlusion right your blood pressure is so high blood blood is not moving anywhere and so in the middle of a very heavy set especially complex movements especially when they're loaded on your body um this could be in overhead press or or squat variations anything like that blood pressure is going to be a problem and reason why that matters is that's what's going to make you pass out it's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen in 3 seconds it's the fact that blood pressure got so high you blacked out and so we want to have we're going to have to play this game of releasing a little bit of the pressure so we can actually get blood to move a little bit making sure that we don't lose spinal stability um so we can finish our workout that's really the question you asked right how do I play this game of oh I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest and I don't want to Exhale right so that I don't lose spinal stability but at the same time I don't want to pass out right which is a which is a problem so kind of a couple of rules of thumb if you're going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load that's probably your best strategy so in that particular case you'll see a lot of breathing techniques um where you're going to take a very large inhale ideally this is done through the abdomen not the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing clavicles Rising during this thing you'll see a common mistake of of the bars on their back and you see people do this like big inhale thing and all they do is Elevate their clavicles that's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the abdomen which is what you're looking for so you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas in front of you to your left and right and to your back that's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine you can do that in independent of your clavicles moving like your shoulders don't need to rise for that you don't really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes you're just using the air for a brace that's really all you're after so you're trying to visualize your torso as more or less a cylinder yep and you're trying to fill it with air the logic being that if I were to push down onto a say a a full unopen can of soda yep water for all you sugar phobes out there soda water uh and then push as hard as I could it's going to be hard for me to crush that can but if the can were empty or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle correct then I could likely Crush that can yeah what you're really doing is you have your spinal Erectors in the back right and then a whole series of abdominal excises and you actually have some neural control symatic control of Contracting those but the you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do so you're basically bringing in air and saying I'll use air to push from the inside out and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in to create this brace and I don't want overcompression with the muscles this is a like if you if you see people that have just enormous spinal Erectors sometimes that's an indicator of of actually a poor breathing or bracing strategy because they're using spinal rectors create all their compression and not actually using the inside of enough it's not always the case but sort of like a thing to think about so overcompression through the spinal Erectors is not necessarily ideal um if you wanted the best scenario is a little bit of a brace a both so we use some air to push this side we use some musculature to press that way and then that that spine is just nicely held in position um again not in a position where I've locked down my diaphragm and I can't get any air out I should be able to get that brace pattern um and then be able to speak in fact like I'm doing it right now and you'll see like a little bit of a if you're really paying attention to my voice you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference but I should be able to do this for quite a long time right like I I I could take a maximum rep right here in this position whether I'm overhead pressing doing some sort of row like anything and feel fairy braced in in the entire quadrant this is very helpful I I'm going to work on it but can we say that a an effective way to start off in terms of breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase the Ecentric phase and then to Exhale during the Y concentric exertion phase I asked that because that's what I've been doing for a while and it makes me feel safe I don't know if I am and it allows me to Exhale as I exert the the U hardest portion of the exercise yeah and perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts where one tends most often is trained to Exhale on the on the strike yep if you're going to be doing again the number of repetitions can be completed without a breath a lot of the times you're better off saving that exhalation until you complete wow but but for a reasonably heavy set of hack squats or even leg extensions and given that I already can't leg extension my body weight we establish maybe this is why um the idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set so again brings to mind um you know like where is my insurance card who's going to drive me to the hospital this kind of thing um in all seriousness what if I want to breathe during the set yeah so I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one rep max or something like that okay well certainly could hold my breath for a one repetition maximum that you know maybe like a double or something like that depending on what you're doing like maybe a triple a bench breath you can probably do three and get away with it a squat it gets harder deadlift so it kind of depends on the exercise um you want to take that be breath though prior to the Ecentric portion not during so ler breathe in lock we're set and now start our movement pattern wherever it's going to be um exhaling on the concentric portion during it it is fine it's no problem um especially if you're not extremely heavy and what's your what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming yeah fine I don't care okay I don't tend to do that I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper um but I do it person but I do it very quietly I think of you and I think squeal whimper absolutely thanks um if you're going to be doing multiple repetitions uh what we actually do for the NFL combine is we teach them a very specific Excel strategy so there's one test that they do uh which is they bench press 225 pounds for as many reps as possible a lot of these people people will get 25 to 40 repetitions so we have a very specific breathing pattern it would be something like if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps say that's like our goal we might say okay do the first 10 without without a breath and then exhale reset and then do five breath and then you might do five breath three breath two breath and then one breath per rep until we can't get any more um so we'll have very specific strategies for them um so what I would say is is think about how many you're going to complete and and then breathe according uh to that and it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to failure because you're going to want that that error a little bit but you just want to make sure that when you're re when you're breathing back in you're in a safe spot so you don't want to be catching that like rebreath when the weight's on you you want to be in a locked out position or away from you when you're standing um so it tends to be like at the end of the exercise not in the middle of it um which is is going to be a recipe for problems if you take your breath then one of the reasons I'm so happy to have you here having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot Y how does one contend with the first attempt at a lift not working out it too heavy something goes wrong hopefully not injury promoting wrong but something goes wrong do you count that do you reset the workout and then the counterpart to that question is what do you do if it's too easy when wrong wrong because you didn't put enough weight on the bar didn't pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells do you abandon the set and and replace it with another and I guess this is really a question of how much margin for error is there in volume yep when doing this 3x5 program sure uh two things that I'd like to start with number one is I talked about linear periodization and undulating periodization there's actually a new model newish model called Auto regulation which basically says you're going to go in today and depending on any number of biomarkers performance markers or your performance you will adjust your training based on how you're feeling that day and so 70% is that maybe for example not necessarily 70% of your one repetition Max highest ever is 70% of what you can actually do that day and so it actually allows you to Auto regulate your training based on actually what's happening and so you don't have to have as much long-term planning in your program design um because it'll sort of figure itself out as you're going you can use velocity to determine this Auto regulation you can use actually it's like taking it up to close to a Max for the day and then basing all your percentages on that daily Max or a lot of different ways so that is actually one very effective strategy and there's a lot of research coming out on auto regulation there's a lot of different ways to do it so that's one thing to say another thing to say is this three to five okay um it depends on if we're going for speed power or strength because while all those other variables are the same for three to five the core difference between whether that is a power workout or a strength workout is the load right so if you are at a moderate load say 30% of your one repetition Max up to about 70% that's going to be a power-based adaptation assuming you're going with high intent can you sorry I I have to interrupt maybe just clarify what intent is yeah you're attempting to move the implement or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can great thank you if you're trying to go for strength and you're below 70% you're not really going to be improving strength because the total mass is not heavy enough and so really when we say strength we're assuming you're at at least generally 70% or higher now if you're new to training totally different thing right but if you're moderately trained to highly trained you're going to be well north of 70% so anything below that we don't really count anyways um that's those are warm-up sets basically all right so one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers here and I don't have all of these memorized we can perhaps um provide a chart later or send out something to them but there's a chart that you can look up called a pilipin chart how do you spell that uh p r i l i p i nin pipin and there's actually been a a few studies on it it's it's a it's it's been old it's been around for a very long time it's sort of in the coaching realm and then a handful of studies out of New Zealand came out verifying and validating a lot of it but what it effectively does is say if strength is the goal and this comes from the powerlifting weightlifting sort of communities optimizing for strength then how much time do I need to spend at each intensity range so 70% 80% 90% Etc because specificity is going to say this if you want to get better neuromuscular guy at shooting a basketball the most important thing you could ever do is shoot a basketball under the exact circumstances that you're going to do it right specificity always wins if you want to get better at strength the most important thing you need to do is that exact movement at that load and in this case if you wanted to get better at you know bench press lifting at 100% of your max on a bench press is the most specific thing you could ever do the more you can do that the faster you will increase your bench press Max however that's very hard to do without getting hurt it's also not addressing what I call your Defender so if the reason you can't bench press higher than whatever you're benching now it may not be your pure strength it may be any number of things like you don't have enough muscle or technique or these things okay great so specificity over here um variation on the other side and so we're playing this game we've talked about of of how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity in my training without leading to uh overuse injury all how do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury while getting enough speci specificity and so we have a classic Paradigm over here one actually training protocol you can look up is called the Bulgarian method and the bulgarians were un amazing um at the sport of Olympic weightlifting um probably in fact the the uh the the patriarch of this entire thing recently passed away Ian IV uh neams L monog Glo pocket Hercules one of the greatest weightlifters of all time came out of the system and they do a lot of things but one example in the Bulgarian system is you're going to do a one repetition maximum snatch you're going to take a little bit of a break you'll do a one repetition maximum cleaning jerk take a little bit of a break do a one repetition maximum front squat take a little bit of a break and you're going to repeat that two to three times a day every day that's specificity right those people get extraordinarily strong now they don't do that all year round they don't do that with all their lifters but this is when we're trying to Peak for a major competition like the Olympics we are going so far into specificity and that was very counter to the Russian system with a which is much more of our classic periodization sort of approach okay specificity is is tremendous but in doing that the bulgarians just brutalize a lot of athletes right because it's very difficult to handle something like that and you can't really do that that long without getting wrecked and there the goal is to win medals the goal is it's a totally different thing than longevity out of here right like we're trying to push the boundaries of or aesthetic changes unless someone has a naturally balanced Physique in general if people do one sort of movement I find that they tend to resemble the equipment that they did that movement with over time right that was a joke against kettle bells of course of course of course I got it so we know specificity is technically optimal but it's not realistic not for that kind of a you know extreme situation so how do we balance these things well it turns out this pilipin chart gives you guidelines for how much time and by time I mean how many repetitions to stand um in each of these rep ranges so that you get kind of the best of this world you're going to find the same thing by way when we get into endurance training there's only so much training you can do at 95% of your heart rate before it starts becoming like quite detrimental you need to actually spend a lot of time at those lower intensities so the prant chart walks you through how many sets and it gives you a range like like the I think that the bottom of it is like um how much time do you spend at like 60 to 70% every one at Max and it says like you know a minimum of this set to a maximum of this set but the ideal number of reps per set per week is like 18 and then it walks you through and so there's there's four CR IIA on it um I think it's 55 to 65% again how many reps there it's like 3 to six reps per set um 18 to 30 reps total and I think the ideal rep range is like 24 something like that so it g takes you have 55 to 65 70 to 80 80 to 90 and the 90 plus percent what you'll see is the 90 plus perc number is more like 1 to two reps per set for a total of about seven total repetitions if you start cruising past that um other bad things start to creep up in there so that's a really effective chart what it really highlights though is even somebody who's trying to maximize strength you're going to spend something like 35 or so perc of your training time between this like 55 to 65% range so you're asking early like well do I even count that one the the answer is yeah you know in that range if it's below 55 60% you probably don't count it now again some coaches don't count it unless it's even above 70 fine it's not a major distinction but you're going to spend the bulk of your time you know accumulating some some technique basically and skill and tissue tolerance very important um The Next Step Up is like 28% I think is is sort of the cut off of how much time you spend um between 70 and 80% of re one or Max and then it jumps down to like 23% and then all the way to to 70% so you can walk yourself through that and that gives you an extremely good guideline and you'll notice all of these are still in three range it's just really you're manipulating it by total sets or total exercises so that can give you some structure to play with we will provide a link to the pipin Chart yeah in the show note captions training to failure when the goal is strength yeah should one do it should one avoid it or does it depend well yeah it always depends um the way that I'll generally say it is because of what we just outlined in the Brin chart you don't have to go to failure to see strength gains especially early or even moderate and I'm talking maybe five plus years in your lifting career would you um call beginner zero to five years of training intermediate five to 20 years of training yeah something like that and then Advanced would be people that really put the time and energy into fine-tuning their program the vast majority of people who think they're Advanced are really what we would call intermediate in all domains of life Fair even as a scientist it's quite rare to reach that number of advance so um I actually don't have any problem going to failure quite often um I'm also fine with people who don't want to go all the way there you can get most of what you need getting what we call technical failure so this is like okay that was really challenging uh boy you started to have some breakdowns of technique we're going to call that good The Only Exception here I I want to point out is people who are either novice or beginners they really have no concept of what 100% means and so I think it's actually very fruitful to take them to 100% just to give them a guideline of where it's at now of course do this on exercises that they are comfortable with or close and then you may maybe maybe this is on a machine maybe this is um single joint movements or whatever it takes for them to have confidence but I actually I don't think you should be scared of these they're not really um that much more dangerous than anything else there's I mean think about it if you're going to do a front squat or any exercise and and your one rep max is 200 lb is it really that much more dangerous to do one try at 205 lb than it is to do five tries at 190 pounds like is it really that much more no like it's not so you can do like we talked about in the the first episode you can do a a repetition Max estimate where you get to like 85 to 95% of where you think you are and then instead of adding load you just do as many reps as you can Google that number and then it'll tell you the conversion and estimate of what your one RX is that's fine but I also I have absolutely no issue uh in fact I generally encourage it to take people up to that level um certainly not day one or or anywhere close to that but at some point let's see what you actually got I'm just I'm just going to cut it off early what I'm going to consider to be one at Max um anything more than a minor technical breakdown is is for that crew we're going to stop and and call that good and ideally with a spotter especially um you know bench pressing don't bench press alone in your basement kind of thing a few people die each year from bench pressing alone in their basement or use dumbbells if you're going to do that hard harder to to die using dumbbells I suppose you could um drop them on your head or something but not get stuck under them um exercise selection and frequency of exercise implementation across the week so I can imagine with this 3x5 routine done three to five times per week you could imagine changing up the exercises every workout MH although considering that most of these 3x5 routines are going to be done with compound movements generally that sooner or later one runs out of movements if the goal is to hit major all the major muscle groups yeah however Let me Give an example and ask if it's okay to for instance do the 3x5 routine where one of the exercises for back is say a bent over row uh you do that on Monday Wednesday and Friday okay you know I can imagine one could do that and still recover and improve over time but 5 days a week bend over Rose 5 days a week is that okay I mean can one still progress um and there I could imagine it's a strong answer of Depends because some people recover more slowly and others I'm very comfortable doing hitting muscle groups once directly per week and once indirectly that's worked for me far better than two or three times per week you know I get you know looks of sympathy when when I say this but it's actually is just how my physiology Works um kind of yeah well and maybe I'm not optimizing a number of different features but the point being that some people really do seem to be able to train a muscle every day and still make progress other people seem to have trouble when they train a muscle every day so how does one establish exercise selection when the goal is to make progress um and this brings up something very important and we're going to have an whole episode about this but local versus systemic recovery y that you know is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued and is the muscle group and the related muscular skeletal systems becoming fatigued we're going to go back to thinking about when you make these comments about it takes you three to five days and you've got better results in there the assumption that you're probably running under is your training style is more reflecting that recovery time than it is your physiology it's not you it's you're training so if you look at again all the Olympic weightlifters that are competing they're going to be squatting or some variation of squatting every day that's going to happen like a lot of the times they're training multiple times a day and they will be doing some basically barbell full squat multiple times a day every day six days a week you know something like that they're the best in the world at getting powerful they're tremendously good at getting strong you can do it right it comes down um to what does your volume look like what type of movements are you doing um what rep range uh what overall volume are you hitting and how are you doing it if you look at athletes they train their legs every day when they're running around they're doing Speed and Agility training every single day they don't need you know three days to recover can you imagine a basketball player trying to ask for like three days to recover between practice right well to be fair as you as you chuckle at me I'm doing other things on the intervening days yeah so I'll train a muscle group like legs and then I'll give it 4 days before I do an indirect yeah um uh what I call an indirect exercise for legs which for me would be sprinting then it get two days and then I'm training them again but nonetheless an athlete has to do that every day right right so the ABS the answer is you absolutely can train any of these muscles every single day it really comes down to volume right and it comes down to movement type um and how are you getting so with in the case of of weightlifters and and athletes what we tend to see happen is there's not a um there's two things there is a long period of conditioning and I don't mean endurance what I mean is is tissue tolerance and conditioning so they're not going to start off their career at that pace right their career might start start off at five days a week but maybe every other of those days is a PVC pipe only and you're just training the movement patterns you're working on technique Etc and then eventually maybe after 6 months or a year those PVC pipe days turn into barbell only days and so now you went from you know a pound to 45 pounds and then eventually as your years go on that that ratches up so it depends on the style in general speed and power stuff is so light it almost require because it's non- fatiguing it requires almost no no recovery so if you were truly doing say like um you know your when you say it's funny because when you say I do legs on Mondays you don't even realize it but an athlete does legs every day right but you're saying legs and what you're really saying is I do hypertrophy legs Monday pretty much that I don't want to get into what I do specifically because it's less important than what other people choose to implement but the repetition ranges anywhere from four to 12 correct soy you're smack dead in the peak sorus longest recovery range volume is relatively low intensity is very very high workouts are very very short so if you were to switch that and you were to stay under four repetitions higher quality uh higher rest in between them I would be willing to bet a a large amount of money that you'd be fine the next day certainly 40 hours and if you were to actually go way lower and keep you know 3 to five and keep it very very light and train for Speed you would have absolutely no issue the next day so it really comes down to a function of of training you're right in that hypertrophy Zone which is something that you probably need 48 hours at minimum to recover from because What You Won't See are bodybuilders training the same muscle group on multiple days like very often at most it would be indirect but generally they're not going to do that every single day for the same reason so you're training in that style that's what it's going to take to recover if you trained in a different style then it wouldn't take that long to recover so for the person starting out would you recommend they pick three to five exercises and stick with those so that they can get their skill and movement and positioning and breathing all that really dialed in and then start to experiment by varying one or two of those exercises over time that's great if you look at the the conjugate model so these are the the strongest powerlifters as a collective group group that ever existed what they're very good at is they keep almost the exact same weekly structure but they make a very small change in exercise variation so for example say say Wednesday is bench day right they're going to always bench on Wednesdays but maybe this week they're going to do close grip bench and then maybe next week it's going to be maybe a a special type of barbell and then maybe the week after that it's um you know maybe they'll change the range of motion a little bit so it's actually the exact same exercise where they're making a very small variation and that change alone allows them to do enough specificity but also gives them enough variation to where it's not the exact same stimuli in the exact same spot over and over and over and that's what allows that group plus lots of other assistants but it's what allows that group to train very very very heavy very consistently and not have to worry about too much planning for periodization and other stuff like that they get their back off by making small variations and exercise I will say a major mistake folks do make is they change your exercises entirely way too often um if I were to have to pick one or the other I would say don't change anything on your exercises for 6 weeks probably realistic maybe even 10 to 12 weeks and then you can make some changes um you should not be changing every single week um the general you're just you're not going to see progress it's going to be very difficult to do that so um it's going to take you three weeks generally to figure out the groove of the exercise to figure out how well you can load it what's too much to where you woke up unbelievably sore that was a train wreck um how much do I load it at how what position how long is this going to take it's going to take you three or so weeks and then you can really start pushing there so changing it before that or in that time frame is is you're not going to be able to progressively overload because you're just not going to know exactly where you're at on all the exercises so it's very important to create standardization within them and then see some progress in a movement or a muscle Group whatever you're going for and then make some changes so before we dive into our discussion about hypertrophy can we just get a brief recap of the general parameters for an excellent power and strength training program okay let me hit you with these rapid fire and then you can maybe come and ask questions along that remember those modifiable variables okay so let's go through them in order and then what they mean specifically for power versus strength so modifiable variable number one is called choice so which exercises do I select for strength in general for power or speed or strength we want to select compound movements you don't often see people doing maximum strength work for like a tricep Kickback right it's typically multiple joint movements and typically complex um movements in selecting these compound movements we generally want to actually think about exercise selection of movements rather than muscle groups so this is an important distinction because we'll see this is a different answer when we get hypertrophy what I mean by that is when we think about again strength training we tend to think about bodybuilding Concepts we go to the gym and we do things like I got to make sure I get my chest today and I got to make sure I get my hamstring strs and now you're selecting exercises based on a muscle you want to work for strength development and power we want to think about movements rather than individual muscle groups so there should be like things like I need to train explosive hip extension which is like a a a vertical jump or something like that I I want to train pushing or pulling movements or I want to attain rot I want to train rotation which is a whole area we haven't gotten into which is very important for overall health and wellness longevity so we want to select big movements by the muscle the movement patterns that we want to introduce and we just want to select a reasonable balance between these I don't care what the exact ratio is you just don't want to go an entire six months without doing anything in this rotational area or an entire you know 8 to 10 weeks without doing something um uh that's a lower body hinge right so any number of examples there so just think about the rough movement patterns upper and lower push and pull and then some sort of rotation that puts you in a pretty good spot if you're using 3x five method and you're going to pick as little as three exercises just pick one from each one of those group pick a rotation pick a a push and pick a pull I can easily think of a push and a pull um so for example um bench press or shoulder press sure um row or chin for pull and then squat or deadlift for hinge yep what would be a good example of a quality rotational movement y so anytime um you can can use a cable machine like at the gym and you can do it's kind of hard to describe this exercise but basically you're going to stand facing the cable and you're going to pull it toward yourself and then rotate like you're pivoting like you're um either swinging a golf club or hitting a baseball bat so you're facing One Direction I'm facing you right now I'm pulling the cable towards myself and then I'm going to spin do a 180 degree pivot and face exactly away from you when I finish and then return it back to that same spot so that's a rotation great we will provide a link to an example of that that you consider a quity example a medicine ball throw any number of things like this are a great rotational exercise all right so we select our exercises based on that we generally then the ca because of that as the case we don't worry about things like Ecentric versus concentric because you're dly doing a whole body athletic movement right which the Ecentric concentric portion is going to be folded into that you really can't separate them out all right so that's exercise Choice our first variable the next one is exercise order so because that everything driving power and strength is quality based you want to do these at the beginning of your workout you would not want to do anything fatiguing before this so no cardiovascular training no other uh repetition to failure stuff if you do those before and now you're slower all you've done is practice getting slower and and so these need to be done when you're fresh you also need to do them when you're very fresh because they are the most neurologically demanding they're complicated they tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple planes and coordination is a difficult thing and if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh and so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results um to kind of recap that uh one of the major mistakes when training for strength and especially power is people worry way too much about fatigue those things should not be part of the equation in fact if they are that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly right these are non- fatiguing movements especially speed and power so Choice order is next um the next one after that is volume and we sort of hit volume and intensity which is the other one um we we talked about that the volume is basically identical between power and strength um the the general number we're going to look at here is something like three to 20 sets total per workout per workout um but that would be like 20 would be a little bit of a special case three to five is what I told you earlier right I'm just saying like sometimes you can actually go quite higher in cases but that's the general range and once somebody finishes the 3x5 workout for power or strength if they decide they want to throw in some calf raises and curls and totally a forearm work or a little bit of uh joggy on the treadmill or something that's okay absolutely that there is you have very little risk of interference for things like speed and power strength you have a little a little bit of a risk only because now you're introducing fatigue which if you're really pushing strength that might compromise your recovery ah I could imagine doing the three to five routine for strength or for power and then somebody finishing up with um 10 or 15 minutes of hypert try arm workor and then being very seriously compromised if they try and come in the next day or even the next day correct and do those big compound movements for Speed and power that's right not just because they're sore but the muscles may actually still be damaged and I know later we're going to talk about the um somewhat tenuous relationship between soreness and Recovery yeah yep so that that's a that's a really nice uh heuristic to pay attention to is you can but just be careful Energy starts to matter at that point um if you're really truly trying to maximize strength you would do nothing at all outside of that training um if you're just like I kind of want to get stronger and some other things and you're willing to lose strength you know 5% of your strength gains then you're you're to fine um the same can be said by the way for super setting so super setting is an idea that says like wait a minute you're telling me dude I got to take five minutes in between each set well that's not so much a problem nowadays with phone with um smartphones because people are filling their interet intervals with social media and texting correct you you don't really have to go that long in fact there was actually a study that came out in the last month that showed you know like really 2 minutes is probably sufficient for most people having said that if you really are trying to push maximum strength adaptations like 3 to five is very very reasonable um you're those training sessions are long because you have to take you're spending more time not doing anything than you aren't doing something but you're trying to maximize quality so that's just sort of like part and parcel um if you're not super worried about it you can actually do super setting which is let's imagine again you're going to do some some lunges and while your legs are resting doing their three to five minutes you can go over and do an upper body row or pull and when your upper body's resting you're going back to legs so that really Cuts your time in half is it ideal no we actually ran a study uh maybe 10 years ago in our lab and we looked at that specifically and we did see a reduction in strength performance in the super setting group relative to the group who did not superet the question then it becomes like is it enough for you to care so if you were if I were to say hey I can cut an hour off of your workout time but you will lose 5% of your strength gain almost everyone would take that exchange with the exception of people who are getting close to competition or really trying to set a new lifetime PR or something then you might say no I don't want any interference there that last little margin is what I care about give me the extra rest great so it's not a does it work does it not work it's always a what are you willing to give up uh versus get the practicalities of super setting or staggering Push Pull Push Pull uh in my mind are real because you have to take over large segments of the gym which oftentimes leads to a situation where your rest times are too long or highly variable because people are working in or you can't finish your set because now someone jumped into the machine totally screw you lose three to five of your friends because it's obnoxious when you're taking over all the equipment but in all seriousness I think um it's wonderful if you have the space and the and the format to do it but at least in my experience and observation um these people know who they are uh it's not practical to do on a regular basis if you train in an open commercial gym yeah tough to pull off so um we've covered Choice order volume and intensity to a sufficient level the last one is frequency and we've already sort of indirectly talked about that where frequency can be as high as you'd like in this area it really depends on your recovery if you're really truly pushing maximum strength you probably do need a few days to recover although that's dependent upon you but speed and power can be done multiple times a day almost every day basically um the one exception would be maximum sprinting speed you need to be careful there for things like hamstring uh injury especially if you're pretty fast so you want to be a little bit cautious of that but if you're doing easier movements um like medicine ball throws or kettle bell swings or something you could do those quite often as long as the volume is is staying pretty low last little piece here is progression how do I progress over time so I mentioned this earlier but just wanted to fill this Gap right back in before we head over to hypertree which is 3 to 5% increase per week of intensity in general um and you can do upwards of about 5% increase in volume per week over time and I generally recommend running that for uh at longest 8 weeks but probably most realistically you want to go about five weeks or so and then have some sort of a D Lo or back off week if you do that you're you're generally going to be a pretty good spot um so those are like the Core Concepts now there's a whole bunch of fun methods you can play with within all these categories and and I I would like to actually cover just a couple of them um if we've got a little more space for that sure I'd love to hear about those I'd like to also just ceue up one which is while I joked about people texting and doing social media between sets and I that's not a joke I well I confess I stopped bringing my phone into the gym yeah um because of the urge to you know take my mind off of the workout and I just started enjoying my workouts a lot more yeah and the workouts go far better that way and they're they're just much more efficient it for me I I realize that some people their careers take place in the gym so for I don't um look down upon anyone using their phone at the gym but that really tends to help um me but I do wonder whether not there's an optimal Behavior or mindset in between sets M um I've heard before that pacing around can actually help diffuse some of the lactate and other metabolic uh byproducts of of work and exertion yeah that can lead to better performance I've also heard that um you know shaking the muscles out I mean there's all sorts of Jim lore um about this but maybe there's also some decent science I'm just curious uh if you have any specific recommendations that people could play with or try yep so for for Speed and power um you want to walk this balance of stiff but fresh and so if you were to literally finish a repetition sit on a bench for five minutes you would stand up after that fairly stiff and you wouldn't feel sort of smooth this is all SC this is all non-science this is all practical application right anic data anic data there you go strength is a little bit different but it's the same concept you're walking that line um in general a lot of the times if you see powerlifters and weightlifters in between sets they're going to sit down and not move for hypertrophy can be a little bit different because you're getting towards fatigue and so the factors you mentioned like clearing lactate well first of all lactate is not actually causing fatigue that's that's a giant myth that we which is why I teed it up no I'm just kidding um but in the case of again speed and power you're not going to fatigue so fatigue management is not really issue you want to make sure that you're getting complete neurological recovery which is a little bit slower than muscle energetically you're not out of any gas whatsoever right um You are not a lack of fuel you know doing three repetitions of a vertical jump Y no close plenty of glycogen totally what about stretching between sets yeah you probably don't want to do that either um there are very clear examples of pre-exercise stretching static stretching being quite detrimental for maximum power production the same thing for Speed uh and strength and that's been shown actually a number of times in a number of Laboratories which is like a a classic Hallmark any scientist looks for of like really jumping on board with an idea if it's shown not only multiple times but in multiple Laboratories from multiple scientists and they're all seeing the same thing you you start to get a lot of confidence that that's a real finding and that's been shown um we've done that in our Center for sport performance not myself but one of my colleagues has done a lot of stretching research and he's seen that a lot on everything from vertical jump um to ISO kinetic dynamometers and and force velocity curves and there's um we we've seen this in sprinting we've seen this in speed we've seen this in loaded stuff so um you don't want to spend a ton of time stretching statically stretching a muscle prior if you do that and you have to do that say say for example you finish that you're just like feeling really tight yeah go ahead like you need to get in the right position especially for most people where are you willing to sacrifice 10% of power to make sure you don't get hurt yes that answer is almost always yes outside of some very specific athlete scenarios so if you're not in the right position I actually remember having this conversation with Kelly Kelly started a long time ago was just like yeah fine I'll lose 5% that means I'm not going to get in a bad position and hurt my back I and I totally totally agree so if you got to open up a hip or an ankle or something to get there get in the right position number one we'll live with the 5% reduction in power and if you do just reactivate so before you go do your working set go do something fast again a vertical jump a short Sprint an acceleration and sort of get that system cleared back up um if you didn't stretch it for long long enough and you didn't hold it for long enough you should be able to be just fine so um when it comes to hypertrophy yeah you can really stretch all you want because we're not it's not driven by intensity or outcome it's being driven by an insult into the tissue and so if you're pre- fatigued for hypertrophy it doesn't matter if you're pre-stretched that doesn't matter we're not going for quality of outcome we're going for quality of internal signal which is not going to be um Changed by your Force output so it doesn't really matter you mentioned a few other things that one might consider in light of uh the list that you provided of choice order volume frequency and progression right so starting off with power uh I just wanted to hand the the listeners here with a whole bunch of different methods to go play with right so as long as you hit those Concepts the repetition range for power 30 to 70% of your one repetition Max depending on the exercise and your training status um you're going to get the power as long as you're attempting to go fast this going to be great a lot of things you can try ply metric are a great example um of things that are effective for um for power development we we've mentioned medicine ball throws uh short Sprints you can even do Sprints uh on like an airbike which is a great super safe activity you can do them from Like a Rolling start where you kind of like get going a little bit and then you explode for 5 seconds to see how fast you can get or a dead start like both of those are very very acceptable um weightlifting movement so snatches and cleaning jerks are tremendously effective in fact they are pound-for-pound by far the most effective uh exercise choice for power development like without question um so those are good ones clapping push-ups speed squats these are a whole host of different things that you can do for Speed and power development I'm depending on your kettle bell swings another great one um all these can be done depending on your preference exercise availability what's at your gym or not gym any of those things if somebody is more focused on strength as opposed to power what are the additional variables they should consider again within the context of this overarching theme of choice order volume frequency and progression absolutely it's almost identical with a couple of small exceptions number one you probably can't do as many working sets per week for strength because now you're introducing a heavier load and that's going to represent some sort of fatigue um load on the tissue all those things so you could probably get away with doing 20 sets of two of a vertical jump four or five times a week you probably couldn't do that at a 90% on squat right so the total amount of sets and the total amount of weekly load you can get to just needs to be lower and then the intensity right so we talked about that needs to be generally higher than 70% with you know some portion of that being working sets and some portion of that really truly being at 90% plus everything else is is pretty identical you still want to emphasize maximum speed despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster because you've introduced load you still need to be attempting that but you're going to be picking complex exercises you're generally going to be hedging more towards barbells in machines so this is a case where um body weight training can be effective again particularly for the upper body but at some point you're really going to have to move past that because there's just a certain amount of load you can't put on the lower body with just your body weight you get limited by how much you weigh or I mean there's a couple of things you can do but you're going to run out past that pretty quickly and so in when it comes to strength they tend to be less athletic movements because um you know we have to have a barbell on us we have to have a we have to be on a machine or something like that and so that's a subtle difference in exercise choice we need to also be careful about the Ecentric portion and things like that we don't have as much risk in like a speed or power one so um some of the different things you can play with there we've talked about doing things like pushes and pulls I also love carries so a farmer's carry uh pushing a sled dragging a sled all kinds of things a Yol walk all kinds of of carry modalities that are very very effective for strength um there's Ecentric overload training which we really haven't gotten into but it's a really Advanced technique where you can actually load at greater than 100% of your one repetition Max but you're only going to do the Ecentric portion of it um so physiologically you are much stronger eccentrically than you are concentrically um for a variety of of of muscle tissue reasons actually and so imagine if you can do a bench press at 200 lb and what you might actually do is load it to 220 and you would have a spotter and and maybe even use it in a rack and you would lower it Down Under Control all the way to the bottom and then stop your friends would lift it back up the top and you just practice that Ecentric portion you would actually be able to lower say 220 pounds effectively despite the fact that you wouldn't have been able to lift it back up um you don't need to start there but that is a very effective method for incre in fact argue one of my um one of my doctors stud right now is is doing a project on this at USC and he uh like he's focusing directly on this and it's it's quite clear this oftentimes more effective at strength development than anything else because you can actually just like in the speed example where you want to actually practice moving faster so instead of practicing at 100% of your one or maxtra strength you actually practice at higher than that to get better at it um so that's that's another um much more advanced tool please don't let me get sued by saying all that like folks be careful make sure you're doing the proper exercise and you're positioning and and like caveat caveat caveat okay um but outside of that it can be it's it's totally fine and safe yeah with it when people get injured they can't train you can't train you don't progress you you lose progress so uh certainly that that's worth highlighting so two more um little more advanced techniques that that I want to throw out there and one of them is called cluster sets so cluster sets are there's a bunch of ways to do it but imagine taking a mini break in between every single repetition so say you're going to do five repetitions in a row what you're actually going to do is do one repetition set it down pause for 5 to 10 seconds and then do the next one pause do the next one pause pause pause pause pause so you can imagine doing like a squat and you're going to go down explode up you're going to stand there you're going to Rack it out you're going to kind of like shake back out catch your breath walk back in do another one rack it out and you're going to repeat that until you've executed your three or four or five repetitions and then you take your 3 to 5 minute break before your next set that is an incredibly effective way for both strength power and actually even hypertrophy because you can keep the quality the force output the power output very very very high because you're getting these little Min breaks and you're not getting fatigue setting in by the time you hit your say third or fourth or fifth repetition in that set um after repetition one you start to see very small subtle reductions in power up but because you start to see a little bit fatigue you you take those 5 to 10 seconds off even up to 20 seconds you can actually do it um you don't see any drop and and force output over the course of the five and so what you really have done is you've gotten five in this example first repetitions which is the way we kind of say it right so all five of those had the same quality as rep number one which is again as we're talking that's the driver and strength and so that's the one we want to preserve so um it takes a little bit longer um for some exercises it's not very good um it's great for like a deadlift because you set it back down shake it back out regrip hard to do with the bench you got to Rack it back in then rerack it back out that's it's like kind of a pain in the ass um so there's some exercises it doesn't work well with and some that it does but cluster sets and a lot of research on those um very effective would you recommend if somebody's doing cluster sets that they do them for every session within that week or just this is an occasional thing you could do it this could be your training strategy yeah absolutely so you can really take it that serious um in fact like if you look at again the weightlifters they will do cluster sets by default not even trying so say they'll do like a clean and then they'll drop the weight back out they're supposed to be doing say a set of three but almost always they're going to like Shake It Out regrip and then pull it again and sometimes their set of three takes like a minute and then like you hear it's funny because it's like like I set a tri a triple PR you're like no you did three singles like what's the difference between doing three singles and a set of three when you took a minute between each rep um I love that community so yeah I mean it give be your strategy like it could be like hey for this five we block this is all my training especially for your compound movements if you're going to go to start doing some of the smaller movements maybe you give up on that um it could also just be something you do for your one primary exercise for the day so do that thing that is the most important first and just do it for that one and then the rest of them you can kind of ditch it if you need to save a little bit of that time um it can also be something you do by feel so you know you're your two reps in and you go God like I'm not feeling like poppy here like rack it catch my breath for a quick second and do it so it doesn't happen have to be ultra planned um I guess what I'm doing is is I'm giving you an excuse to make sure you're super fresh for every rep it matters the last one I want to talk about here is what's called Dynamic variable resistance so Dynamic variable resistance is uh fixing the problem we have with What's called the human strength curve so theory of constraints again you are only as strong as you are in your weakest point of the movement so depending on the the movement you do this happens at a different range of motion well the deadlift is the easiest example um it's also because we've done like research in my lab using this stuff on the deadlift so I can speak to it very directly when you go to pull it off the ground some people are going to fail right at the bottom meaning they won't get the weight off the ground at all some people will fail just below the knees that's like kind of like the hardest transition period and then some people will fa right at the top just before they can lock out okay great so what that means is at some point of that lift you're going to only be limited by your strength in the weakest area all right so if you have a constant load on the bar in those other two parts of the range of motion where you are not the weakest they're never truly being tested for their maximum strength because they're always being limited by the previous one this is the same argument that we would get into if people ask about should what what do you think about using straps right um You strapping your hand to a bar for deadlift things like that there's pros and cons here there are times when you want to use a strap and there are times when it's a bad idea so what dynamic variable resistance is is either using things like a heavy band or a or chains on the bar if you've ever seen people do that um so in my lab we actually have a force plate on the ground and then we have um built-in basically hooks uh in the front and the back so we can actually set a a barbell on top of the force plate where you stand on it and then run bands from the back to the front running over top of the weights and so when you stand up as you're going up vertically the band are getting Tighter and Tighter and pulling the weight towards the ground so the weight is getting heavier and heavier as you stand up so as you start to gain mechanical advantage in your positioning you start to increase load because the bands are getting Tighter and Tighter and Tighter so this allows you to train that full part of the strength curve and to challenge um your stronger areas with heavier weight and your weaker areas with lower weight um you can do the same thing with a bench press you can do it with a a squat and any other exercise variation and dynamic variable resistance um is incredibly effective for a number of things um you're going to give up a little bit um because the total load you can put on the barbell is lower because you're going to be adding you know in large cases several hundred pounds of band tension and so it pros and cons it's always a game it changes the curve but it's it's a it's a very good technique um that that people it's fairly easy to implement it's fun and in fact if you try this on on a bench or a squat you're going to be the first time you give it a go you're like oh my God cuz the bands are pulling you all over the place um so you have to get very stable very quick um been shown a number of times a handful of studies out of many Laboratories to be a very effective training technique a little bit more advanced but I wanted to throw that in there for the folks that are maybe just tired of sort of doing the same barbells and dumbles and machines and you want to try something different a very effective technique sounds like fun yeah it's great with your permission I'm going to read back my summary list of training for power and training for strength according to your description and you can tell me where I'm right and where I'm wrong yeah I'm going to pick three to five exercises and these should be compound exercises so multi-joint movements I'm going to perform those exercises for three to five repetitions each I'm going to do three to five movements total per workout and I'm going to rest three to five minutes between STS okay if I'm training for power the weight load on the work set so not the warm-up sets but the work sets are going to fall somewhere in the range of 30 to 70% of my one repetition maximum yep and the larger the movement the higher that number goes so on a squat you're okay getting 50 or 60% on a bench you would not want to go that high uh you would want to stay close to that 30 to 40% range so the way you scale that up and down is dependent upon um the difficulty of the movement great if training for strength I'm going to have my work sets be 70% or more of my one repetition maximum yep and the only thing to add there is in the case of actually all of them um it's okay to go less than three reps per set so a single or a double you know one or two rep time is also fantastic so uh we use three to five as the concept but less is okay going more than that is generally not a good idea so less is okay more is generally not okay and then you listed off a number of really valuable I don't even want to call them fine points but important points to keep in mind within each in both of these programs one that really stands out in my mind is this idea of if I perform this 3x5 program but I'm also including some hypertrophy work for arms or calves or muscle groups that might not be hit as directly as one might like during the 3x5 component that's okay but do that after the 3x5 training and keep in mind that that additional work can potentially compromise recovery for the 3x5 power promoting or strength promoting program the example being for instance if one does arm work on the first workout of the week or even the you know the third workout of the week or the fifth workout of the week and that arm work is higher repetition hypertrophy directed work it's reasonable to assume that it might impede some of the 3x5 power promoting or strength promoting training in the subsequent workout so just to be mindful of that and perhaps throttle back on the intensity or the volume or if my goal is strictly power or strictly strength probably best to leave out other forms of training yep love it one last little thing I don't think we did Justice is intention and the reason I want to go back to this now is because we've talked a lot about specific loads you have to hit and that's generally the case but if intention is there you can fudge those numbers in terms of how much load goes on the bar in fact you can get as low as no load on the bar a great example here is like a plank exercise so you can do a plank in which you get in a position and you simply contract the least amount necessary to hold the position also you could contract as hard as possible pulling your scapula down and back squeezing your core squeezing your quads squeezing your glutes that is actually going to still help strength production because you're attempting to contract very very hard even though quote unquote the load is the same that thing extends to weight on the bar so you could theoretically see large improvements in strength at 50% of your One max if you're Contracting as hard as possible and so there's a lot lots and lots of different ways you can train for strength that are outside of this weightlifting weight training spectrum and and if if people if you hear things like this and you're like wow I know I read this book or I saw this other coach who you know was like I got so much stronger that way well if intention is there those are absolutely possible this could be anything from body weight style of training it could be very low load Implement stuff so a kettle bell a light kettle bell or a ball it could be single leg training like all kinds of different methods they will only work for strength though when you're past your first you know handful of months of training if intention is there and if it is then these specific numbers and protocols don't matter as much so don't get too caught up in them if you're not worrying about exercise quality and this is very very important because you mentioned earlier about how you stop taking your phone into the gym with you um one of our former students U Ramsey ninjam is a the head strength conditioning coach at the University of Kansas and he made he made a great post a couple of days ago where he he gave sort of a tip of how do I improve training quality and one of his tips is set your playlist before you go to the gym and the reason is people send spend so much time in between sets just finding the next song that they like it makes their workout so long and so unproductive so that is one strategy or do what you do which is Ditch the music entirely when you don't have music or a phone to look at you only have one job you only have one thing to pay attention to and what you'll find is the quality of the training will go up exponential ually um you will feel kind of quote unquote bored but that's just means you'll go back to training and you'll get a lot more done because you have one thing to focus on so you can get a lot more done when you avoid those distractions and when you're doing strength and especially power work since it's not fatiguing uh strength will be a little bit but Power won't be people tend to get very bored they're used to either feeling a a pump or a burn or a sweat or and that's their like perception of my quality of workout these exercises will not hit that for you so there has to be another metric you're looking at which is I'm going to try to move as well as I can as hard as I can that's going to produce your results if you can't do that then you might as well just not do these workouts go do something else you're just going to be wasting time you're going to be burning a very low amount of calories you'll have wasted an hour and you're going to go right back to the place you were so be very intentional um there are actually some some studies showing that music can enhance performance we've done some of these in our lab so what's that mean it's not about the music per it's about the focus and intent and do whatever it takes to be very focused and intent and you can actually get in and out very quickly and get a lot of work done and see a lot of results love it okay let's talk about hypertrophy the topic that occupies the minds of so many youth young men but also a lot of women I think one of the really interesting progressions that's taken place in the last decade or so is that far more men and women are using resistance training in in order to evoke hypertrophy growth of muscles for aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons what are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy so not to correct you or insult you but probably a a better way to think about that question is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle to induce hypertrophy now there are um hormonal factors that are important there are nutritional factors but just to stick with the context of training um this is really going to frame a lot of our answers and as you'll see it's one of the reasons why I call hypertree training kind of idiot proof in terms of programming now the work is hard difficult and all that but the Precision needed is a lot less than what we saw in power and strength and so if you note there like it's very important that you do it in this style with this intent and with with these Within These parameters and if you're outside these parameters it's not going to be it hypertrophy has a very Broad range um in terms of your actual applications and this is why you have and will continue to see countless styles of training that all work I mean I know you uh were mentored earlier in life by one of my favorite people in this entire field Mike mener like just an absolute character his style was completely different than what you would see in a classic textbook um or or any UN number of different influencers or coaches or individuals and and if you've ever s thought to yourself like why is it all these programs work and people love to jum to things like well that's the steroids like just get that out of the equation for now independent of that or that's not even part of the equation you're still going to see results and the question is like why well that's because what's driving changes in strength and power are the adaptations of specificity what's driving changes in hypertrophy is much more well-rounded and so you have options to get there remember you're training a movement and now you're training a response and a muscle that causes to growth that's very very different so if we look at like the classic Dogma we have to basically challenge the muscle to need to come back in this case specifically bigger and the nutrients need to be there to support that growth okay the nutrients aside perhaps we can come in a few more minutes and talk about that so all we really have to do is going back to our our dogma of activation of some on the cell wall we've talked about this earlier that's got to induce that signaling Cascade that's got to be strong enough to cause the nucleus to react to it to go to the ribosomes to initiate this entire Cascade of protein synthesis okay so that signal has to be one of a couple of things either has to be strong enough one time it has to be frequent enough or it has to be a combination of these things all right so I can get there with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal like more akin to what you did with with Mike back in the day I'm sure and still train that way still train each muscle group mainly once a week directly and once a week indirectly so all you can all you have to do there to not fail is to make sure the training is hard enough and it's going to work if you choose the frequency path then you actually have to make sure you're not training too hard to where you can actually maintain the frequency the only wrong combination here is infrequent and low in it and low volume that's it as long as one of those three variables is high you're going to get there because the mechanisms that are needed to activate that signal in Cascade are wide ranging and this is why when we even see things like Blood Flow Restriction Training right this is when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg and you block blood flow and you use no load or as low as say 30% of your maximum and you take it to fatigue failure that actually is an equally effective way of inducing hypertrophy despite the fact that you know you're using three 5 10 maybe most 20 to 30% of your One Max why because you went through through the route of of metabolic disturbance okay other ways say a higher load maybe uh as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions is going to get through through what's called mechanical tension and so there's there's these different paths that we can get to the same spot now eventually these things have a saturation point so you don't need all three of these mechanisms the third one of course being muscle damage or breakdown and I and and I know we want to chat a little bit about that but none of these three are absolutely required you can have multiple of them in a session um you don't have to have breakdown at all that is a complete uh well really it's a flat out lie that you have to break a muscle down to cause it to grow that that's just not needed at all you have to have one of these three things though and so again this allows you a lot of flexibility which is why crafting your program which is best for you is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypert you just have to make sure you do the work um and you want to make sure you have a few standards in place with the exercise choice and some other things that will um we hit just a second but that's really the fundamental way of getting to it um making sure either that signal is loud enough or frequent enough to give the nuclei a convincing enough reason to spend the resources because you have to remember two things in order to grow new skeletal muscle you need amino acids which are your supply and then you need primarily carb hydrates as the energy source to power that synthesis process you remember basic chemistry it says if you're going to take two atoms and you're going to pull them apart or put them together right that's going to take energy typically and in most of actually metabolism uh when you split a bond you're going to get it's called exonic you're going to get energy from that but when you put them together that's going to take energy this is why we call that protein synthesis right so you have to convince your nucleus that one invest those resources in energy primarily carbohydrate but number two and more importantly invest that Supply there's a ton of possible ways to get energy but there's a very low amount of amino acids available and you need them for many more things than just taking your biceps from 17 in to 18 in right it's not going to do that if you're in a position to where again you can't sustain immune function if if red blood cell turnover needs to be higher or any the other main like tons of things that you need proteins for so you have to be able to say like are you sure you really want to spend these resources and build it into muscle because once we do that it's very difficult to go backwards break them back down bring the amino acids back into that to that availability pool so we can use them for either another function entirely or even another muscle group um that's called protein redistribution by the way when you say um maybe you you don't do um a lot of upper body work in your training and you're not eating enough protein or a minimal amount and you're doing a lot of lifting in your legs you'll you notice your leg will get larger but that's actually a lot of times you're pulling the protein from say your upper body in this case and redistributing it back down um to the quad so that's the way you that's what you have to get to and in terms of application what numbers to hit we can go through each one of our modifiable variables um just like we did with speed and and strength and power and walk through some of our best practices in each category yes so I'd love to talk about those modifiable variables as they relate to choice of movements order of movements volume so sets and repetitions and frequency of training and I'm particularly interested in frequency of training because that relates to the so-called split where typically one is not training their whole body every workout although there are I'm sure hypertrophy workouts that um are whole body workouts but where people are dividing on their body parts on onto different days so uh would love to go through this list one by one starting with exercise Choice cool great so in the previous section we pretty much said exclusively choose your exercises by the movement patterns and you want to balance between pushing and pulling and rotation and things like that in this particular case you have the option to do either here's my recommendation most people default almost exclusively to Choosing by body parts here right I'm going to do calfs and shoulders today and chest and back whatever combinations of things they want that is clearly effective strategy however uh many Studies have actually been done where you choose by movement patterns and that is actually equally effective now one little caveat I actually should have said a few minutes ago when we talk about the research on muscle hypertrophy it is important to distinguish the fact that the vast majority of This research is coming from a novice to moderately trained individuals there's actually more and more research coming out on trained individuals but that's still moderately trained right even those ones so what happens and those people that are actually way past that point we we don't know scientifically it's very difficult to do research there so that's an important caveat I will acknowledge when I say hey you don't need to do this or you have to do this you assuming a training status of of moderate to to low um may or may not be true past that we don't know scientifically I have certain thoughts personally but the science will only take us that far so that being said you can actually choose by muscle um or by movement pattern here whichever is is your personal preference and this is actually where you can act just become a good coach whether you're coaching somebody else through this fitness journey or it's yourself and give them a little bit of autonomy so maybe you select the first three exercises and then let them select one every day and so if they uh especially want to make sure that one muscle group grows let them Target that muscle and maybe the rest of the day you've actually split it up as Push Pull or something else like that um all those strategies are effective personal preference as long as the total amount of volume on the working muscle is equated throughout the week which we'll get to those numbers in a second then you're going to be in the exact same spot no problem I would actually generally encourage people to choose exercises um in a variety of Fashions I actually think that it's important that you do some um number of combination of what we call bilateral and unilateral exercises so bilateral being think about it like a squat where by meaning two lateral you have two feet on the ground moving you know in sequence here unilateral is one so this could be something as simple as a um rear foot elevated split squat it could be a single leg leg press or single leg curl it could be a pistol squat something where the the individual limb is moving one at a time you need to have a combination of bilateral and unilateral training that's good to do for strength as well probably not super important for power but I'm also very important for making sure for I pury sake you're not getting any imbalances um as you progress especially through months and years of training so make sure you're doing a little bit of a combination whether you want to pick specific implements that's really a methods question and a preference question then it is Concepts so dumbbell great kettle bell fine barbell awesome ban doesn't matter body weight none of these things are as important because all you're trying to do is create a certain insult in the tissue and the Implement is just whichever one you feel best doing it and this is where actually machines come into play a lot machines are greatly underappreciated they are a fantastic resource especially somebody um who's either early in their fitness journey or somebody who really is having a hard time targeting a muscle group with a bigger compound movement so when you're choosing exercises for AER trophy you're going to want to start with those bigger compound movements that's going to be drive a lot of the adaptation you can get to these single joint movements like a little bit later but having said that because of of the way that people move differently their bom or their anthropometrics and and their bom mechanics and even their technique the same exact exercise will not necessarily work the same exact muscle groups for multiple people so if you and I both went and did a back squat um if you did a little bit more of what we call a high bar squat so this is the bar is literally setting up higher up on your neck you're keeping your back more vertical and because in order to do that you shift your knees much further past your toes keeping a of course your whole foot on the ground in good position okay that's going to generally put more of an emphasis on the knee joint right and so that's not a bad thing um you tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there a little bit less work in the spinal erectus and back because you're actually not supporting the weight horizontally which is a diff it's a much more difficult position it's it's vertically stacked okay if I were to do it in the classic low bar squat which is again lowering the bar down my further down my back towards uh L like my shoulder blades I probably take a little bit of a wider stance and when I squat I drive my glutes back further away from the midline in as in fact as a general rule if you take the midline of your body the thing that moves the farthest away from that midline is likely to be the thing that's activating the most so in the case of the of the front squat um you're not generally going to be using your glutes as much if you're in that are not even front squat just that high bar squat where you're very very vertical your knees are going to be moving very far over your toes which is fantastic therefore a little bit more knee dominant as kind we say it the other version here you keep keep your shins really close to Vertical you move your butt backwards you're going to have to then lean forward with your torso which means it'll be more low back more glutes and a little bit less knee now that's a general statement it's not necessarily always true but as a guideline there that is one exact exercise where you may be going man I'm trying to improve this clear weakness I have in my quads I can't even leg extension my body weight I have a significant problem there so maybe in your particular case if I'm hammering you or you're hammering yourself in a squad exercise and you're wondering why your quads aren't getting any stronger or aren't growing in any size it may be because of the style of the movement so I may need to go Andrew all right look squats in general if you look at the research are an excellent exercise for Quad development but for you they're not because of the way you stand or just because of you know neural activation it doesn't matter so I need to take you to a machine and isolate that muscle group so we can make sure we see development in that so if you're trying to grow a specific body part uh area individual muscle it's very important that you're actually seeing progress there and don't worry about well in the textbook the bench press is supposed to be good for your PEC because if you're not actually moving the right position or it depends on the angle in which your sternum actually sits in your body a a bench press may actually be doing very little for your PEC and you may need to adjust to say an incline bench or a decline bench or a peck fly so machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate without having to worry about things like stab ability um your low back position getting hurt where's your neck at you can really concentrate on just the movement concentrate on the muscle and let everything else kind of go away and ensure you're getting training in that specific area those are excellent recommendations one thing I want to ask about is prioritizing specific body parts and therefore specific exercises and here I'm not necessarily referring to trying to bring up a so-called weak body part you know a area that tends to be either genetically deficient cuz in some cases I learned for instance having seen a lot of um competitive track and field championships I love watching track and field as a spectator up to Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there's a meat and sure really love that the sprinters are amazing um they have some of the highest calves in the world that I've ever seen I mean like little like little micro calves but they're fast as hell they're right behind the knee and they have a very long distance between that calf and their foot which makes it propulsion excellent right they wouldn't stand a chance as a competitive bodybuilder nope but because something different is being selected for in bodybuilding but obviously they're they're um magnificent for sprinting most people of course reside somewhere between the extreme of you know very long muscle bellies from you know origin to insertion um or very very short muscles usually people have one or two body parts that they want to emphasize for whatever reason you know these days it seems to be um people are really uh what are they saying now like glutes are the new biceps or biceps or the new glutes or I don't know anyway you see this stuff I love them both by the way I am so Pro curls in the squat rack there you go love it right there you go so nobody kill me so everyone has their thing but the that they would like to emphasize but I have a question because we're specifically talking about hypertrophy which is should people give themselves permission to not train a body part if their goal is balanced hypertrophy I I'll give a couple of examples one of the reasons why for instance not done a lot of free weight squatting is because despite my quadriceps being rather weak according to you um they tend to grow rather easily relative to other muscle groups and the goal for me has always been balance development Y and so I emphasize hamstring work and I emphasize you know calf work and hamstring work um it's not that I don't train my quads at all but I do far less for them and I avoid the big compound movements for them I occasionally do them and what again this is not about what I do or don't do but I think that in the context of a conversation about hypertrophy is it appropriate to give people permission to say listen if you're just genetically H uh you know strong large lats doing a lot of chin-ups and rows might actually be the worst thing for you if your goal is balance development and I um I ask because I don't often hear um anyone any you know credential people give people permission to completely avoid training a given body part if their goal is balanced development and yet I think most people who are resistance training are seeking balanced development I don't know anybody that actively wants to have big upper body small legs I think that comes from neglect and laziness in most cases sometimes it's injury related or other things but um I think this is an important point to raise that any good program for hypertrophy I would think would have to take into account people's genetic and natural variation um sport based variation in which muscle groups just tend to grow easily for them and which ones require a lot more focus and work yeah absolutely you first of all you have permission to do or not do anything you'd like to do in terms of of hypy training uh I generally would not recommend disregarding a muscle group entirely I know that's not what you actually suggested but just to make sure that people didn't hear it that way um what I would do is in this example is I would continue to do those big movements I would just keep the volume low so I might do two sets or something uh twice a week um there's a whole bunch of reasons you want to make sure that those motor patterns are there um you want to make sure that the the especially the benefit of these compound movements is you get to work so many complimentary muscle movements at the same time so in the case of like loaded squat you're not only working stability in the hip um as well as the knee but you're also working upper body uh your your rhomboids are keeping you in position your neck has to stay in position your toes everything is working and so it's really difficult to get those things when you take uh that move movement out and you replace it with say a a machine hamstring curl that whole element of balance neurological control is very very important to maintain over time and that just gets removed with if you go to machines only so um I I would keep some of those things in maybe even not all year round but maybe one quarter of the year two quarters every other rotate it something like that um as long as it's getting you're not if the reason you weren't doing say those squats was uh because you're like ah it hurts my back or okay great then leave it out but if it's just simply you don't why your quads grow too much I would just keep that volume low and do something just to kind of touch it keep it activated uh and to maintain all those other things like um flexibility range of motion I would bet anything your adductors are probably underdeveloped right now you can get those by doing your squats because you're not really doing I'm sure much adduction training and so there's things like that that just get lost when you're only thinking all big muscle groups um that that come inherent in doing the larger movements and so you don't have to worry about them or train them separately I appreciate that and in reality I do two to three really hard work sets of hack hack machine squats per week yeah which is plenty for me to maintain and even get a Little Bit Stronger but per our earlier discussion about a year ago I shifted to doing very low repetition ranges to main strength in that movement but I am actively avoiding hypertrophy in that muscle group yeah or another solution would actually be do something like one set to failure a week not even extremely long just you know do something in the 8 to 15 repetition range um at the end of all that strength set and just get a little bit of pump there and then and then just just so just so that those muscles can touch that level of fatigue touch that level of strain and mechanical tension Walk Away Great thank you for that what about exercise order amazing so implicit in this exercise Choice thing it it's what you're going to notice is these modifiable variables interact with each other right and you can clearly see how when we talked about volume And to clarify volume is the repetitions multiplied by the sets that's typically how we express volume well that's going to be directly influenced by intensity the heavier load you put on the barbell the less repetitions you can do and the inverse right uh rest intervals the shorter you keep your rest intervals then either the lower the weight has to go the intensity or the lower the rep range has to go order is the same thing choice is the same thing so all of these things modify each other they play a little bit of a hand in in what everything else does so with the exercise Choice thing rolling into exercise order you get to play a couple of games here when we talked about strength and power I basically said stick to the big movements most complicated compound movements first you don't have to do that with hypertrophy you can do this in a couple of ways you can do the thing you're just simply most interested in first you can do this thing called pre fatigue so say you're you're going to do a back day you could go in and do nothing but isolated biceps as your very first exercise and then roll into uh your your pulling movements because what you'll see is during most pulling activities the biceps are a secondary or tertiary muscle group but you've pref fatigued them you've guaranteed that muscle of most interest got its its most training in and everything else is secondary so you can start if you want with single joint movements you can start with isolation stuff or you can start with compound stuff um either way it just really comes down to preference and what you're specifically trying to develop now this also goes back to the exercise Choice question right because it's it's sort of the same thing right like which one am I choosing and where I want the capus was the exercise splits and and so you sort of talked about am I doing body part splits and I know a question I get a lot here is well which ones should I package together I'm not really concerned with it what you all you should worry about is how many times per week and in fact total volume you achieve on a muscle group per week and I don't doesn't really matter how those things are folded in it's really a personal preference issue um one mistake that we see here commonly is grossly under appre apprting that the legs are not a muscle group right so the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them so we see a classic split like I'll Do shoulders and chest Monday and then I'll do you know biceps and forearms Tuesday and then legs Wednesday or whatever and then back to upper body and then I was like you're like wait a minute you have four days dedicated to the upper body and one for quote unquote legs well like you hopefully you can see the imbalance what's that's going to happen there over time is you're going to do do far more upper body than you are lower body and that's not appropriate so you just want to think about your lower body like you would do if you're going to do body part splits then include those things as well and don't just chunk everything in as legs once a week if you want to do that that's actually okay but that day has to be very very challenging and you probably should do quite a bit of volume U there because you're you're almost surely not going to hit the total weekly volume needed to optimize muscle growth if you're literally only doing one once a week of your quote unquote legs so along those lines Let's Talk Volume yep how much volume does each muscle group need per week in order to generate and for that matter maintain hypertrophy right so the the kind of minimum number we're going to look for here is 10 working sets per week correct per muscle group correct and um just to make sure that everyone's on the same page if I do a chin up or a pullup I'm going to mainly be training my back muscles my lats if I'm doing it correctly lats and rids and biceps right and if so but they'll be indirect targeting of the biceps so would you include indirect targeting so for instance if I you said 10 sets per week let's just use biceps because it seems that that's the go-to uh generic muscle for what why is that by the way that when people ask somebody to you know Flex their muscle they always Flex their bicep they don't flex their calf or their quad or their glutes or something I guess there's some um you know public decency issues I can tell you uh with my children that's the very first muscle I taught them to flex they're glutes no they're they're B I was gonna say good um good uh healthy parenting advice from Dr Andy yelpin so if it's 10 sets per week for biceps in order to maintain or further grow the biceps but does that mean if somebody does 10 sets of chinups or 10 sets of chin-ups in rows that are checking off any of the boxes for biceps assuming that they're doing the movement properly yeah and targeting the major muscle group that a given movement is supposed to Target which in my mind when you're doing a chin up you're supposed to mainly be using your back muscles and then there are secondary muscles or secondary activation of other muscles but of course some people their arms grow like crazy when they do chin ups and their bag doesn't grow at all so this is where we're back to the kind of um genetic preloading of the system yep um if you will so how how does one meet this 10 sets per week minimum when dividing different body parts and thinking about this direct and indirect Activation so two things there's no specific exact rule here and this is why these set ranges are ranges right and this is why why we don't say like 10 is so 10 would be sort of the minimum number you want to get to the more realistic number that most people especially if you're Advanced or even intermediate is more like 15 to 20 working sets per week week okay now if you're very well trained you probably want to even push more towards like 25 and in fact um past that there's just not a lot of research so the optimal number may be 30 we don't we don't really know it's just hard to get that much work in um it may actually even be detrimental and here we're referring to Natural athletes that is people who for whatever reason either because they're not taking any prescription drugs or maybe if they are whose levels of steroid hormones mainly the andrens like testosterone Etc do not exceed the normal reference range values either because that's what they are naturally or that's what they're replacing through pharmacology whereas when we think of technically someone could be taking exogenous hormones to replace a deficiency and then they're still in normal range okay but I just want to um clarify because you work with athletes a number of different sports where drugs are and are not tolerated Etc and the general population that what we are talking about here is for the general population not for steroid using athletes correct okay yeah great so um so 10 was sort of that like absolute minimum number to maintain which is actually pretty cool if you think about it this way uh if you went in and you did three sets of 10 it's a very stand three sets of 10 repetitions correct you're already at three you did that three days a week you're at your nine that's almost 10 if you also just went to the gym one day a week you did three sets of 10 and you did three exercises you're at nine working sets you're BAS basically done so achieving 10 sets per week per muscle group and now we're not even talking about indirect activation of a secondary so you're you're going to hit 10 fairly easy um extension to that hitting 20 is actually still not that hard because of what's actually going to happen there so in your example if you're doing your chinups um well would the biceps count there's no exact rule there because uh there could be technique issues it could be hand position so you mentioned chin up very specifically a chin up is actually to put your hands in in this position where your palms are facing up right this is superation and pronation so you're going to be there well that's actually quite different than a pull-up or your hands are are in the opposite direction so um a chin up actually is going to be pretty good activator of your biceps for most people um so you would expect actually to probably count that because it's going to be very difficult to not see some fatigue in your biceps depending on your mechanics depending on and by that I mean just the the segment lengths of your bones right that's where your muscles or originate and insert there's nothing you can do about it's not even a technique or a focus issue it's just simple fact the matter of that's how you pull best in that area um the position in which your hands are um on the Barra wider grip more narrow grip it's going to change muscle use so we talked about um earlier I think in the previous episode that exercises do not determine adaptations applications to but exercises do determine things like the movement plane The Joint you use and typically the Ecentric concentric sort of ratio as well as often times the muscle groups involved so there's just not a lot of things you can do depending on how you are built of you know some exercises activating a secondary group and you don't want it so it's not always a technique issue it may just be that's how you're built right and the same could be true for a squat um the high bar versus low bar sort of example we talked about earlier it's you know you you can see plenty of of evidence on um muscle activation studies where people even doing the vertical back squat style have tremendous glute activation and folks doing the the low bar have tremendous quad Activation so a lot of it depends on personal mechanics so what I counted is the question really you just have to ask yourself number one do you really care that much you know you have a range to get to if you were anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets you know you're fine so if you count it or don't count it it's just going to change the difference between whether you did 17 working sets or 23 and either way you're fine so I don't really care number two are you actually feeling anything there so if you're doing your chin-ups and your biceps are blowing up I'm counting that right if you're doing it and you're like no I don't feel any fatigue there it's all my then I'd probably say okay we're not going to count that as as towards so um you can just let that guide you a little bit towards your account yeah I've always noticed that there are certain muscle groups that are very easy to isolate yeah when underload and those are almost always the same muscle groups that are easy to contract very hard without any load whatsoever Bingo you know that's actually really insightful so um you can kind of use this Uris stic of of like if you can contract your lats just standing here you're probably going to contract them very well when you lift if you can't you can probably assume about the same thing's going to happen so uh yeah you'll know um this actually the ls are actually really interesting um because they tend to be one of the more difficult muscle groups to learn how to activate so if you're in your Journey you're just like I have no idea and um you can look up like a lat pose so how do you like how do you pop your lats out how do you show it and if you do that and you're like wow there's no movement here just recognize that's extremely common and that it's probably going to take you many many many months of trying before you start to see some movements and probably even a few years before you really start to see Activation so you're you're not some sort of like specific like special genetic anomaly it's very very common it's uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps right that everyone can do that but if you're just like man I can't get this here I'm just going to stop doing it do not do that just keep at it and just keep concentrating and thinking about that muscle group it will take some time it's very common to to have challenges activating lats yeah I've noticed that many of the muscle groups that were responsible for a large fraction of the work in the various sports that I played as a young child are muscles that are very easy for me to selectively isolate and induce hypertrophy in um I suppose I'm one of those mutants where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle groups I think that's because I swam a lot when I was a kid was literally going to ask you a swimmer that's like a Telltale sign yeah everyone every kid in my town swam and played soccer there go and then later I you know I skateboarded and did some you generally hear that answer you either were a swimmer or you a wrestler so it's like that pulling and pull toward you is is thousands of repetitions allowed you to get very good at Contracting MH but because um I also played soccer and skateboarding but I didn't do any baseball basketball or football muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging to activate and isolate so I do think that early development is superimposed on a genetic template that sort of predicts which muscle groups are going to be easier or harder to isolate and and train it's also a very good case for why it's important to do as many different athletic activities as you can in your youth yeah and if you do skateboard definitely learn to ride switch because every every skateboarder I know has one leg that's larger than the other and one calf that's larger than the other and actually for that matter um people that do martial arts that don't learn to um if they're not Southpaw if they don't learn to switch up and do their uh their work Southpaw you see the same thing I mean you're building an asymmetry into the system and it's not just muscular it's neural strongly neural um so yeah kids um parents get your kids doing a bunch of different things I suppose gymnastics would would probably be the best sport all around in terms of um movement in multiple planes and activating all the different muscle groups uh yes and no um there's a lot of benefit no question about it there's a lot of other things though that it that has limited ability so um almost everything in not like gymnastic is great but almost everything in that is pre-planned which is a major downfall right so the joy of skating is there's so much proceptive input that you have to make decisions very quickly um in in small Windows now you have a little bit of that when you're flipping in the air you have to land but you gymnastics gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine that they're working on and they work on that routine for years soing for me was Transportation it was freedom and it didn't require any coaches or parental oversight yeah yeah Ball Sports have the beauty of of reaction and things like that so all of them are wonderful um yeah good to do a lot of them you've established that 10 really to 20 sets per week yeah is the kind of bounds for um maintaining and and iting hypertrophy yep if I were to like flag one of them I would say 15 to 20 is the sets that you want to get working now it gets complicated when you ask well how many reps per set do I have to get to okay well we also can complicate that by repetition type and Tempo just sort of let all that go for now and just think if you're getting close to that range you're in the spot and all you have to do now is balance two things recovery and continued training okay so if you're somewhere in this 10 to 20 working sets range and you're in a position where you can continue to do that you're not so sore and so damaged and beat up that you can't maintain that volume for you know eight weeks at a time or at least six weeks at a time then I'd probably say either the style of repetitions the amount of repetitions per set you're doing are too much the volume is getting to you however if you're not seeing adaptations then I'd say maybe the repetitions aren't enough and so that's like that's the kind of game you're running now there could be plenty of other factors intensity of course yeah intensity um intent and then of course the other things sleep nutrition Etc all these other things that that go into our visible stressor category that we always analyze this is sort of brings up this idea of responders and non-responders so we get this one a ton so why is it some people uh my my gym buddy my roommate we go to sleep the same time we're on the same nutrition plan we work out together uh she triples in muscle size and I don't have like no gain whatsoever well there's a lot of um work that we're trying to do to identify the molecular mechanisms behind responders and non-responders because they clearly exist in fact this is one of the reasons why uh every paper I basically will ever publish again if I you know if I do always reports individual person data so rather than group averages you get to see you know if there's 10 subjects in it you get to see how each of the 10 responded because the group average can get confusing what you really want to see is how many actually people got better how many got worse um how many maybe changed and if so um so we'll always report those individual data cuz when you go to train you're you're you you're not the group average that's very important to know right so if you do that you can see a beautiful line of these hyperresponders the bell curve in the middle of the normal responders and those folks who like through any training study just won't get any better um if you can tease out which you can't but let's say in science you could tease out all the extra factors total stress load hydration sleep Etc what you often see is non-responders a lot of the time it's not that they have a physiological inability it's just that they they need a different protocol and a lot of times it's they just need more volume so if they can handle that and they're not excessively beat up just give them more volume and they tend to see a lot of breakthroughs um you see the same thing with plateaus um so typically sort of just like okay the routine you're on you've been on it for too long we need to either go to the other end of the hypertrophy Spectrum for intensity which means like if you've been in the like six 60 to 70% of your one repetition max range maybe we actually need to go heavier take our repetitions down maybe even our total volume down and go heavier try that a great way to break through plateaus of of grand if all the other boxes are checked um the other one is is do the opposite which is like okay we're going to go higher we're going to go set to 20 set to 25 High very high repetition range and really get after it um not do as much damage because you don't tend to get as sore from those really high repetition ranges you'll get more sore from the lower repetition higher intensity range than you will typically the other ones and and see if we can blst bust through some plate there so it just generally means you need to do something a little bit different than your your training partner so we've talked about exercise choice and we've talked about the number of sets that one needs in order to induce hypertrophy per week what about repetition ranges you've mentioned some pretty broad repetition ranges how many repetitions per set is required in order to induce hyper yep so there are two caveats here before I give well the number is somewhere between like four to 30 reps 30 repetitions absolutely in fact I think you can go much higher the first 20 have to be feel exceedingly light correct and during those first 20 or so repetitions is the goal still to contract the muscle as hard as possible on each repetition so this is the caveats here so caveat number one is there is an assumption that by the end of the set you're getting somewhat close to failure and so you don't have to go to Absolute failure um to to induce mostly py but you you also have to get kind of close so if you're going to do a set of 25 and you finish it and you're like oo yeah like that was kind of starting to get hard at the end that's not going to be enough if you're going to do a set of five or six and the same sort of expression comes out of your mouth it's not going to be so in that case it doesn't matter your rep range if you're not getting somewhat close to failure again it doesn't need to be complete failure um a good number to think about is like minus two which is what we call reps in reserve which is sort of like I got within two or so reps of failure and then I stopped and can we Define failure at least for sake of this portion of the conversation as the point at which you can no longer move the resistance could be your body could be a weight machine Etc that you can no longer move the resistance and more in the concentric phase of the exercise movement in good form correct that's a really ni momentary muscular failure is is how we typically Define it there's a wonderful review I think it's open access uh that just came out in the last handful of months Eric Helm's team out of New Zealand Eric is a is a great scientist uh and a very experienced physique coach and a competitor himself so he knows a lot about this area um and that paper rent through all the exact definitions in detail all the caveats that we not going to have time to get into today so I would recommend folks like check that out if they want more information but I'll I'll try to get to the highlights of it right here so what they basically showed is going all the way to failure in the defining failure like you just did right so momentary muscular failure you can't complete another repetition through complete range of motion through whatever range of motion you determined prior to as well as with good technique so other body parts aren't being compromised sort of Etc um and doesn't need to be total failure that minus too failure is still needed in caveat 2 which is again very very highly trained individuals you won't see people who are like Eric or other folks who are six to 8 to 10 years into very serious training um who don't have to go to failure probably a little bit more than what I just said so the the the layout that they brought in their paper was very nice and they basically said okay here's a couple of scenarios in which going to failure is maybe the best way to do it um number one you probably should do it on a little bit of the safer exercises so maybe taking your back squat on a Barb to complete failure and doing that as like a standard protocol multiple times a week it's maybe not the best choice so maybe if you're going to do barall back squats you take that to your you know your your one or two reps in reserve stop there it's a lot of work at actually going back to our discussion of the prpp and chart it's a similar idea right where you're going to spend most of your time in these working sets 70 to 90 sort of percent and then you're going to take that failure to maybe the hack squat machine or maybe even the like extension machine so a little bit of a safer exercise they also can tend to be single joint exercises don't have to be but they're just ones that are not as complicated and you're not likely to injure other body parts when you're doing it all right um so that's one one way to go about it another way to go about it is simply doing it on like the last movement of the day right and so again you're not going to do it on your first three or four exercises but whatever your last finisher is you'll hit total failure on that one and that kind of keeps you in a range of yeah you hit some failure you got a lot of overall work done so that's a lot of stimulus that's a lot of noise going to that nucleus that says grow grow grow grow grow but you didn't totally obliterate yourself um especially if you don't have the assistance of anabolic steroids right that's very very important if you have those you can push this a lot harder because your recovery would be significantly enhanced if not um you kind of want to walk away from that I have to assume that you know 99% of people listening to this do not and um and and yet among those who are not taking anything um in terms of anabolics there I think there a large range of recovery quotients out there some people just tend to recover better some people I think also are far more diligent about what I would call the um necessary but not sufficient variables of yeah adequate sleep yep uh proper nutrition um limiting stress and and so on yeah I can't wait to break all that stuff down we got a whole got a very long discussion for all those things we will get into it in all its practical realities and actionables um before long what about rest between sets great this is the interplay now so one actually thing we said for a long time is you want to stick between 30 to 90 seconds of rest between sets for hypertrophy and that's because you're trying to um activate this metabolic disturbance or disruption um you need a little a little bit of a burn a little bit of a pump to go there more recent research a lot of this out of Brad Shen feld's lab and others have shown that that's just doesn't seem to be the case again for moderate uh to to newly trained individuals whether that's the case for the highly trained folks I don't necessarily no um I don't think there's any difference here um so you can take up to three to five minutes of rest in between sets and be fine the caveat here though is this if you're going to rest longer that means the metabolic challenge is lower so you need to then increase the challenge in either mechanical tension which think about is weight load or muscle breakdown so you can't lower one of the variables keep everything else the same and expect the same result so if you're going to have more rest then you need to either preserve um the load on your bar or the volume one of the two has to happen so this gives people a lot of opportunity I generally tell people if you're going to train for hypertrophy it's probably best to stay in the 2-minute range at most you can go longer but a lot of people have a hard time actually coming back and then executing that next set with enough intent to get there and or it's going to make your workouts tremendously long so you can stick to the shorter one um you don't have as much mechanical tension but that's okay you can still get there but in reality of it is you can do whatever you would like tell me if this is a reasonable structure given what you've told us three exercises per muscle group first exercise slightly heavier loads so repetition ranges somewhere between let's say five and eight with perhaps hitting failure close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's let's get wild and say five minutes okay so it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition range is now 8 to 15 shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so and then on the third exercise repetition ranges of 12 to 30 this number 30 kind of makes me wide eyed I I I can't remember last time I did it said of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy but what you're saying makes absolute sense is is research back so very short rest intervals maybe 30 seconds between uh between sets would that allow somebody to Target all three forms of major adaptation um I mean my in my mind it works you know you're talking about mechanical loads you're talking about stress and damage and you're talking about metabolic stress is that better than to for instance do all the high repetition work in one workout per week um and then higher loads in the other workout it does it matter if you divide them up or combine them it it would not matter I would say it matters in the sense of your personal practical situation well long rest for me I love training heavier with longer rest right but I'm hearing that there's real value to doing these higher repetition ranges yeah so the formula you set up there in a second is great if you want to do it the other way that's fine you really it's kind of idiot proof you can set this up however you'd like you could actually do the inverse theoretically you could do the sets of 30 first and then move to your sets of 80 it doesn't really matter um because we're try trying to just get to a certain total stimuli and you're going to hit it eventually so you have a lot of room to play here you also have a lot of room to adapt based on your circumstances God I'm short on time today typically my workout takes me 60 Minutes for this plan I have I've only got 35 today what do I do well if you're training for strength that's a different answer than if you're training for hypertrophy if you're training for hyper Fey you need to make sure you hit that total volume so in this particular case lower the load lower the rest intervals and just get to the burn and get going as much as you can if you're training for strength I would rather you cut your volume in half get those few repetitions done at that high load and just don't do very many sets today that's a better result so the goal that you're going after is going to determine what we call chaos management which is that thing like that um running out of time today my time is short or you didn't even think my time was short something got cut off I'm not feeling it today I'm in a hotel etc etc etc which which is life right that's going to be 10 to 50% of your workouts it's going to be chaos management well how you make those decisions is going to go back to understanding number one what goal you're going after and then number two what are the physiological consequences we call these physiological limiters for each one and that's going to tell you what to select and prioritize the volume the intensity or whatever else I'd like to ask about frequency but I'd like to frame it a little bit differently um than that I'd like to ask about total workout duration which dovetails with frequency because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets per week and one is combining different muscle groups on the same days well then workouts are going to be a very different duration than if one is doing a different body part each day for instance and so I feel like any discussion about frequency has to be within the context of workout duration and vice versa yeah if you are a a lifting junkie and you're very consistent in your schedule I'm actually okay with body parts but most people are not that and so the concern there is if you say are isolating and waiting to do your glutes on one day of the week and something happens on that day you might go another 13 days now before training it you know between workouts and that's really difficult to maintain the frequency won't be high enough unless the load and volume on that one day is astronomically High it's just not going to happen so while if you look at the research um frequency in terms of how many days per week doesn't matter that much as long as the total load and failure are equivalent practically it's a challenge so it's it's hard because life gets in the way for most people especially if you have kids and a job and and all these things over there so I actually prefer doing something more like 3 days a week of total body and if something happens you've just missed that body part for 48s hours 72 hours I like that a little better for most people not because it's more effective but just because it it's a little bit more resilient to life and you can get there um if you wanted to actually do a little bit of a combination so if you wanted to do like two days a week of whole body and then two days a week of a little bit of a body part split then you're actually sort of hedging against all risks there um as long as you get to that total number there now there is actually some evidence in a couple of ways that maybe a little bit more frequently is a little bit better but the difficult is now we're going back to the practicality question of like how many people really can train just their strength training six days a week and that doesn't count any of their long duration stuff it isn't their high heart rate their flexibility their okay it's just really really really hard to get all that stuff in so it is it tends to be easier on folks in terms of execution and long-term adherence in my opinion um to get that volume accomplished in in um a little bit more frequent patterns but not once a week so I I like to kind of have it right there for most people um not again not because it is technically quotequote more effective but because you're less likely to fail to progress because of skipping a workout something popping up your power going out and your you know garage door being locked on you or whatever imagine that that happened to me this morning folks couldn't get out of my driveway because a gate electronic gate was uh down because the power was down anyway solve that problem yeah the way you describe it my sense is that workouts will last somewhere between 1 and two hours of real work is that about right it doesn't have to be nearly that long I mean you could certainly get enough to work done in 30 minutes if you even a whole body workout yeah yeah absolutely so if if you're doing that three days a week so remember the numbers we're trying to hit here let's say we're trying to hit 15 working sets per muscle group per week that's five working sets per day per muscle group so if you did one exercise for that day let's say you did squats you did five sets you did that three days a week you're done there's your 15 but there are other muscle groups to hit on that same day you're doing squats if you're doing a whole whole body corre yeah so you've gotten them all already and so like all the leg muscles in that example are taken care of ah so you would not do separate hamstring work necessar you need to now I hamstrings is actually a little bit of a cave like that's a good example of an exercise or a muscle group that's probably really good to make sure you isolate it's challenging to get with your standard uh dead lift and and squat um it it's one of the probably ones that's most important to go Target outside of that but in the theoretically though outside of that you would get most of your leg muscles done with even a single exercise and even if you wanted to change it up so you said all right Monday I'm going to do a squat variation uh Wednesday the next day LIF I'm going to do some sort of deadlift hinging variation and then maybe Friday my third day I'm going to do some sort of unilateral uh maybe rear FL elevated split squat or something like that all right maybe even a lateral lunge maybe a different plane okay you're in a pretty good spot you're going to hit most of those muscles um to your 15 working sets especially if you take sort of that last set each day a pretty close to failure that's going to get some serious work done but you're not going to be so fatigued you can't come back and train it a couple of days later and you'll be fine so you could even split that up into two days a week and now all you really have to do is hit something like seven working sets so maybe that's two exercises per day maybe some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge you know three to four sets each you're going get six to eight sets that day you did that 3 days a week now all a sudden you're at that 20 24 sets about being a bit boom same thing with the upper body I just gave lower body examples because you know I like the lower body more so it's not that challenging to get to those numbers and split and those workouts can be extremely short so if you're if you were doing that three days a week um you know you're you're doing that one exercise upper body one exercise lower body that certainly shouldn't take more than 40 minutes I'm happy to hear that not because I don't like training yeah please please excuse the double negative but I found that resistance training workouts that extend longer than one hour of work and certainly longer than 75 minutes of work leave me very fatigued oh sure and fatigued to the point where concentrating on cognitive work throughout the day um can be challenging need a longer nap in the afternoon I'm a big proponent of naps in the afternoon in any case but requiring longer naps in the afternoon ETA so at least for me restricting the resistance training workouts to about 505 0 to 60 Minutes of real work yeah for me three or four times per week has helped tremendously so it's a case where doing higher intensity work in a shorter period of time and actually hitting muscle groups less frequently for me that's again once directly once indirectly y has worked really well and as you mentioned earlier this could very well be explained by not my recovery quotient as some sort of uh genetic or physiological variable but the way that I'm training and indeed I like do a few four straps and go to failure on too many sets and you know weaned in the in that um genre of training it's also fun like to just train hard it is it is I think that um I've learned a lot by training to quote unquote to failure um I think there's a lot of learning in there um provided it's done safely but what you're describing actually inspires me to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits and and ways of training for hypertrophy and strength because this notion of not necessarily having to go to failure and still being able to evoke strength and hypertrophy um adaptations is a really intriguing one uh dare I even say a seductive one and that leads me to a question that is based on findings that I've heard discussed on social media which means very little if anything unless it's in the context of people who really um know exercise science and um you're one such person and that's this idea that because resistance training can evoke a protein synthesis adaptation response but that adaptation response is lasts about 48 hours before it starts to taper off that the ideal in quotes frequency for training a given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours is that true yes and no so a couple of things there remember in order to grow a muscle there's multiple steps here so you have the signaling response which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last depending on the marker you know up to an hour or two hours step number two then is gene expression and we see that that's typically peaked around 2 to 6 hours post exercise and then you have following that protein synthesis and that's that longer time frame somewhere between 12 hours there it's certainly not peaked for 48 hours it may be still there 48 hours from now but it is is absolutely coming down at that point depending on sort of a number factors so that that part of is sort of TR so that this is a combination of like some half truths and some like maybe just pedantic things that aren't really that important to differentiate the real question I think is is like okay is it okay to train sooner slash is it better to train sooner or actually is it better to wait longer there's no real reason to think that you need to train if the goal is hypertrophy any sooner than 48 hours afterwards I can't think of an advantage that that would confer I also can't think of any practical applications athletes physique bodybuilders coaches that ever found tremendous success doing that so I would be very skeptical that that is any way better now could you do it in some instances of say you know you've got travel coming up like that so that you just yeah course you want to preload the system by destroying the musle no problem and then waiting seven days or 14 days I've known people have done that before Vacations or layoffs I every time like every single time to annihilate themselves and then take a two we layoff yeah and it's like there's no benefit there other than psychological like I just love it like it feels great to be super sore I feel less crappy not training for those couple days cuz I'm like I'm super sore anyways you need the extended rest yeah of course and it's just like it's just a crappy justification in my brain that like I excuse to do something really wild and that I totally don't need and get way sore than I should get Dr Andy Galvin suggestions of what not to do but that he does yeah 100% do as I say not as I do the famous words of every research Professor yeah I think 48 hours is a reasonable time uh to wait can't think of any advantage of going sooner than that there's really not a tremendous amount of advantage of waiting much longer than that certainly 72 hours is fine um as long as you're hitting these Concepts we've talked about you can let really life determine that um I mean there's situations too with with like particularly our athletes where we have to kind of break that because of schedule obligations they're playing every fifth day every third day or something like that you're just going to have to lift on back toback days you're just going to have to get it done um but yeah I can't think of why I would go out of my way to do that the second part of that question is let's say somebody trains a muscle they train it properly they hit it in the appropriate rep ranges and appropriate rest Etc that the stimulus is there the adaptation is set in motion they're getting somewhere somewhere at 48 hours or so a protein synthesis Peak that's going to taper off yeah but they don't train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later they train it five or six days later not because they're lazy not because they um they don't care but because they have other priorities that are woven in with getting hypertrophy in this muscle right there are people who exist only to get hypertrophy in a given muscle group but let's be fair most people would like to grow that muscle group but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle starts to revert to its prehypertrophic state that is does it atrophy and get smaller again because if it doesn't I could see a lot of reasons for hitting a muscle group once every five 5 days or seven days provided you hold on to the hypertrophy that you initiated 5 or seven days ago yeah there's no reason to think you would lose anything in that sort of a Time domain five to seven days the only challenge with training that infrequently is can you actually get enough total volume done so if you're going to train a muscle once a week you either have to go to real failure real damage and soreness or you have to figure out a way to hit 20 sets that day in that muscle not at all impossible especially if you're thinking well actually all I have to hit is and I'm going to do five sets of three exercises that's not outrageous not at all so so like absolutely possible if you're wanting to go more towards 20 or getting closer to that 25 like now it starts to get pretty challenging so um scientifically the research will suggest it's going to be equally effective practically it's challenging for people to hit sufficient volume without just being so demoralized afterwards because they're in so much pain they can't get out of their car cuz their legs are so trash they can't sit on the toilet get back up without crying um from pain so that's not good no that's not good I say that cuz those are actual examples that have happened in my life yeah I I realizing as we're having this conversation about ways to stimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of defaulted to more intensity as opposed to volume because of the time factor I have a lot of other things going on in my life and So within that hour I Can't Get Enough sets in across all the muscle groups I need to hit and I'm only going to do it about once a week and so it's at least for me more advantageous to just train extremely hard I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique that you mentioned before yep or pref fatigue as you referred to it of hitting something really strong with an isolation exercise then doing compound exercises I'm starting to think based on what you've told me that pre fatigue and then a compound exercise in some ways it's not really two sets because if you're going to failure for straps you're kind of pushing past failure then you're doing a compound exercise and you're doing that two or three times well that sounds like four to six sets but the force repetitions are almost like an additional set right and so it's not 20 sets but it's four to six really really hard sets that go beyond what we normally think of as a set totally okay it's sort of the difference between running on concrete and running on Sand when I go for a sand run it's a very different experience totally yep and this is why uh I should have mentioned this at the very very beginning of our our chat today but all of these numbers that I'll give you for any exercise adaptation you you you cannot think of them as hard lines they are gradients and so when we think about the number for hypert trvy in terms of repetitions I said four to 30 what do you think happens at three do you think hyper just stops right in fact the number you'll see in the literature is more like six to 30 I actually slide it down to four though like personal preference because of that but it just Fades away what do you think happens at rep 31 35 there's it just Fades gradually over over time so you actually sort of brought this up one of your earlier questions and I'm not sure if you were even thinking about this or maybe you were I just babbled on about something else but if strength happens between this like one to five repetition range and hypertrophy typically happens in this like eight to 30 range what happens if I were to do to sets of six or God forbid seven like seven and nine are these numbers you just absolutely don't do in strength training right just like set of 1 2 3 4 5 6 got 8 10 12 like do not program a set of 13 when I'm training sets of seven to nine yeah it's great right uh we'll use sets of seven a lot um with weightlifters because you can actually count numbers more effectively B but what happens in seven to n rep so this is actually wonderful area of these like five to eight repetitions where you're going to get a nice combination of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy so someone who's coming in going man I want to get stronger and I want to add muscle what do I do here well that's actually a really nice answer train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range and you're going to get a lot stronger and you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy if you want to really maximize hypertrophy I would probably spend most of your time in the 8 to 15 repetition per set range you can go up to 30 admittedly though I don't think it's optimal to spend most of your time at more than 15 reps per set it's very challenging to maintain the focus required at rep 27 to actually get sufficient failure by rep you just you just give up way too early it's hard to do the same thing at the bottom end of that Spectrum in terms of of really heavy to get there so I really honestly think 8 to 15 is still it's cliche it's that textbook number but it's a reason that's a textbook it is tried and true and very very very effective if for instance you want to get stronger though and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you have a couple of tricks you can pull number one stay south of that five repetition range you do sets of one sets of two go as heavy as you can um with all appropriate considerations and stick within maybe even up to three reps per set you start getting to four to five to six now you're going to start itching towards that that hypertrophy range so stay down there do a lot more total sets so do a classic example would be something like eight sets of three right you're going to get a lot of practice you're going to get 24 very high quality reps with a lot of rest in between okay you go from there you go to managing caloric intake making sure your protein is still on point you want to recover but if your total calories aren't um you know greater than 10 to 15% above your maintenance needs then you're not going to be able to put on a whole bunch of muscle mass because you just don't have the fuel for it you can also then space your workouts out so that stimulus isn't coming uh extremely often so if you do that thing a couple of times a week it's not enough frequency in that signal so remember that signal has to be frequent or loud you didn't make it super loud and now you're not making it super frequent you can can get very very very strong like that and and put on very low amounts of hyper if that's sort of the choice so you told us a lot about volume and frequency and how that relates to protein synthesis and Recovery to evoke the hypertrophy adaptation response how should people think about systemic damage and Recovery because obviously the nervous system and the way it interacts with the neuromuscular system is the sight of all the action here or at least a lot of the action and the nervous system can in fact become fatigued it's you know that has a great capacity but the whole system that we're talking about can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group like the biceps or the back is being allowed to rest while you're training legs and other muscle groups that your whole neuromuscular system needs rest how does one determine whether or not your entire body needs complete rest or or low-level active rest or exercise of a different kind yeah yeah sure so I want to actually tackle this because we're on the topic of hypertrophy I'm assuming that that's the goal in mind here yes here I'm asking specifically within the context of hypertrophy I realized that for other training goals the answer to this question could be quite different yeah okay so we actually do this in a couple of different ways let's start local and work back to systemic right because um number one what you're really concerned about is at the local muscle level is am I going to create excessive damage uh and I don't necessarily mean muscle damage here I mean injury right so um the kind of rule thumb we use is is like three out of 10 in terms of soreness if you're more than three out of 10 in terms of soreness we're going to start asking questions if you're higher than six out of 10 we're probably not training this is subjective measure total subjective measure right and you'll you'll know very quickly right if you're like if you can barely graze your PEC with your fingertip and then you're like ah I don't care what you score that we're not training there's just no damage if you're three out of 10 if you're just like oh I'm kind of like a little bit stiff here but once you get warmed up you you start feeling okay you're probably okay to proceed this so that is is a very easy way to just think about soreness you're going to be a little bit tight depending on your training frequency now zooming out to systemic we use a whole host of things so we actually have a a whole host of bow markers we use you can get a lot of these from blood so you can look at things like creatin kise that's the very common one marker of muscle damage um we'll actually look at um LDH we'll look at myog globulin um that's just like if you think about hemoglobin is the um is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout your blood the myoglobin is the the part of that that's actually in muscle so when muscle gets broken down that gets leaked out and put in your blood so that's one of the markers actually that's going to be associated with things like rabdo which is a like you're going to see your urine is purple it's extremely dark because you've got so much muscle breakdown that that happens and kidneys get have a problem and you put a bunch of stuff in there so we use those biomarkers we'll actually also look at probably a couple things you're familiar with alt and a um these are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown so if we are actually suspecting that this is a chronic problem um we're going to actually to go and and pull some blood um if it's just like I'm super sore today we're going to use that subjective marker but if we're seeing this as constant like man are we really pushing you way too much is there some sort of systemic problem um we're going to blood and we're going to look at all those different things now as to alt is is really specific and I don't want to take us too far off track here but the ratio to those things is actually very important as well so um if you look at the as to alt ratio typically the number we'll look at as like 1.67 as that ratio is like higher than that you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage but really between you know me and you and a few of these listeners anytime we start seeing a outkick alt we're immediately thinking as in the ratio being higher than one um we're immediately thinking like there's something happening muscle damage wise so um that's actually a sneaky good indicator of just total muscle mass um because the vast majority of that's going to be in muscle so um those are actually some markers that we like a lot if muscle damage is uh the thing we're concerned with if we are more concerned with things like total training volume systemic overload then may turn to something more like sleep there's a lot of information we can actually get glean from changes in sleep um behavior and function um you could also look at things like HRV heart rate variability which is a very classic marker and much more sensitive to changes with training than something like a resting heart rate um which is which is one thing you can actually do that's totally cost free just look at your changes uh and any elevation resting heart rate over time especially more than three to five consecutive days is an indicator but HRV is much more sensitive um to things like training induced overload so that's a a quick version of stuff that we're going to pay attention to the last one I would add there is simply motivation so if if you're really training hard and you like training hard and you just like cannot force yourself to go anymore that in of itself can be a good indication of it's maybe not the day maybe not the week um with all of these things you want to be careful about overreacting to a single day measure again we look we need to look at at least a trend of more than 3 days honestly I'm looking at more than 5 days um I'm going to pull back from that and think about what phase of training we're in what part of the Year we're in typically other athletes we inseason pre-season postseason offseason Etc to make our decisions about what we're going to do about it are we canning the entire workout are we doing a modified lower version lower intensity um my default generally if hypertrophy is the goal remember volume is the driver there so if I can like can we get in can we go real light let's go to six out of 10 rpe so relative perceived exertion um maybe we'll reduce the range of motion maybe we'll make it a little bit easier maybe go to machines or instead of going a squat we'll just do you know a leg extension something like that but I want to still get enough volume in there that will keep you on Target and and again even going at 50% not not to high repetition you know 50% for a set of 10 three sets just get a nice blood flow in there get it in get it out Aid and recovery and then move on and come back the next day that's probably what I would do rather than canning the entire ire session how do other forms of exercise combine with hypertrophy training for instance can I do cardiovascular training for two or three days per week provided that cardiovascular training is of low enough intensity and not disrupt hypertrophy progression and can I do that cardiovascular exercise before or after the hypertrophy training or does it need to be separated out the answer to this is really what we call the crossover interference effect okay it's really an energy management issue so the only time endurance seor starts to interfere or block or hinder attenuate hypertrophy is in one of two broad categories number one total energy intake or your balance is off so you can amarate this by just eating more if you do that then the interference effect generally goes away the second one is you want to make sure you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training that are the same working group and specifically the Ecentric portion so for example we see much more interference with running on leg hypertrophy than we do cycling right less Ecentric pounding and loading less damage less things to recover from the tissue seems to be totally fine the only other thing you need to worry about here is total volume of your endurance work so if you're doing a a moderate intensity for a moderate duration say 70% of your maximum heart rate for 25 minutes it's unlikely to do much damage in terms of blocking hypertrophy you're totally fine do you can you do it before or after your workout it's probably not going to matter that much right so prefatigue is okay for hypertrophy so if your prefatigue is coming from endurance then you're totally fine not a big deal afterwards cool you want to break it up into multiple sessions that's probably better right so if you do your endurance work on a separate day that's probably best case scenario if you can't do that but you can break it up into two workouts say you lift in the morning and then you do your you quote unquote cardio at night maybe that's second best third best is doing it at the end of your lift and finishing it that's fine just make sure that you're maximizing your recovery on all the other tricks we'll talk about later make sure the calories are there make sure you're not doing a lot of Ecentric landing and that endurance stuff and you'll be just fine and where does higher intensity cardio fit into a hypertrophy program so high higher intensity cardio uh for instance in my mind is getting on the assault bike and doing um you know eight intervals of 20 second Sprints and 10c rest in between or perhaps going to a field and doing some bounds and Sprints and things of that sort not going all out not you know running for one's life but getting up to about you know 85 90% of of running for one's life sure so we have a lot less information on the potential interference or not of high intensity stuff um the stuff we do have suggested it may actually Aid in hypertrophy and that's because if you think about it one of the potential paths to activation of muscle growth is this metabolic disturbance you're going to get that a lot with the the high intensity interval thing so it's not a terrible thing to do I wouldn't do it to the level that it compromises your ability to come back and do your primary training so if you're so fatigued your legs are super heavy they're depleted you now have to ingest extra carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen to be able to handle both recovery and continue training Etc that could then lead to a problem but in general U really don't see any reason why that is going to completely block or or make it such that your training was quote unquote wasted or it didn't work in a fact actually um a very recent uh study came out where they uh had individuals perform six weeks of purely aerobic endurance steady state long duration endurance for six weeks I think prior to starting a hypertrophy phase compared that to individuals who did not do that and those folks that did these six weeks of just I think it was cycling actually just endurance work had more muscle growth at the end of their hypertrophy training than those folks that did not so this shows you very clearly there are a lot of advantages that come with being physically fit to Growing muscle so folks that also um have actually hit plateaus a lot one of the things you may actually see some benefit from is actually doing a little bit more endurance work whether it's a steady state stuff maybe it's the higher intensity stuff um certainly if you're starting a training phase it's a pretty good idea to do that and there's a number of of physiological reasons of why that's potentially occurring but the the lowest hanging fruit here is we sort of joke you know like if you're so unfit that you're tying your shoes and your warmup and you're already breaking a sweat you probably don't have enough F Fitness to do enough training to get enough hyper so that is in fact your limiting factor you're not recovering you're super fatigued and damaged and sore because you're so unfit so get fit first and then you can actually get more gains a week later so you have to kind of Kick the Can down the road for a few weeks but 10 weeks later you'll be in a better spot than you were by investing a little bit in your conditioning so as you pointed out before and I can only assume you were referring to me uh hypertrophy training is idiot proof uh meaning there's a lot of leeway in the variables but not so much leeway that people can do anything it it's bounded by these general principles so with your permission I'm going to do a brief overview of my notes based on your description of the modifiable variables that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise Choice exercise order selecting appropriate volume that sets and Reps training frequency and needing some Metric or way to have progression yeah either by adding more weight or by more tension or more metabolic stress and so on in terms of exercise Choice it sounds like the choice of exercises is not super critical in terms of specificity yeah but that the ideal circumstance is that people are targeting all the major and frankly secondary and minor muscle groups if you can even call them that yeah across their exercise choices that they're picking exercises that they can perform safely and that they can generate enough intensity so that they're getting close to failure without placing themselves into danger right so um for some people that might mean including large compound free weight exercises like wats and deadlifts and bent over barbell rows as well as isolation exercises and for some people there might be a bias toward more isolation exercises and machines but of course machines don't necessarily mean that you can't use heavy loads in fact plate loaded machines like Hammer Strength machines it will allow for quite substantial loads so picking two or three or more movements per muscle group can be valuable but that overall consistency is going to outshine variation in the sense that you don't need to hit muscles with a different exercise every workout coming back to the same things has a benefit and we heard about this in our discussion around strength and power as well okay in terms of order of exercises there too it sounds like there's a lot of flexibility one could do the large compound exercise for let's say um quadriceps and hamstrings and glutes first like a a squat or a front squat or could deadlift for that matter but then if one deadlifted and primarily hit the glutes and hamstrings then you might want to Target the quadriceps more directly with leg extensions or if one squatted and was loading the squat bar carrying the squat bar in a way that was predominantly quadricep yeah and lesso glute and hamstring then leg curls would be a good choice Etc okay and train your calves folks very important unless you're a genetic freak of course it's actually a good opportunity to say unless you're a genetic freak or you just have a genetic PR position yeah or you've done Sports and and you have a genetic predisposition that gives you you know very large calvs that don't require any training at all I I know people like this they're they're somewhat rare but they're out there yeah and those folks sometimes want to stay away from or minimize their training you told me that even if you have a muscle group that's a hyper responder in terms of hypertrophy getting at least one or two good hard sets per week is good because you want to keep functionality in that neuromuscular system love it okay in terms of volume again we have a large amount of variation is what I'm hearing that the total number of sets per week is a strong driving force of program design and selection that ideally you're performing 10 to 20 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per week and that could be divided up across multiple workouts or done in one workout but that's 10 to 20 sets per week per muscle group not really taking into account indirect activation so that would be 10 to 20 sets for biceps your back work is going to hit your biceps a little bit maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection but it's really 10 to 20 and given that hypertrophy can still occur and maybe even occurs better with more volume y then don't include the indirect work unless something about the architecture of your body and the inability to engage certain muscle groups like makes the a pull-up really an arm exercise for you do I have that right the way that I would maybe planet is typically with movements we consider to be there to be primary movers secondary movers and then tertiary movers right if it is a primary or secondary I'm probably counting it if it's tertiary or less I'm probably not counting it got it so going back to our example of a pull-up so an example of a pull-up I probably wouldn't count the biceps in a pull-up but I would probably count the biceps during a chin-up would you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up probably not may maybe like uh it just depends um probably not though okay train the rear delts also that's only honestly the reason I answered that is because most people don't do anything for the real delts anyways but they should right absolutely that's why I didn't want to count it I wanted you to go out of your way to make sure you did something specifically for the real rear delts for Aesthetics and for functionality for health and and balance across the shoulder totally neck uh shoulder all of it I'm so happy to hear you say this I'm a huge fan of people doing rear deltoid work for all the reasons you described and neck work for that matter I think people forget that the neck is the upper part of your spine yeah and for postural reasons and for stabilization and safety reasons it's really critical but I think most people aren't familiar with how best to train the rear deltoids and neck and I know a number of people are afraid of getting a big neck which for reasons that are still uh unclear to me is referred to as no neck but let's leave out that no neck comment for the moment what are some good exercises for targeting the rear deltoids and neck safely that people can perform for stabilization and for hypertrophy yeah I would recommend people check out Eric Cressy he's a a wonderful uh strength conditioning coach he actually is I think the director of pitching for the New York Yankees now is that spelled c SS i e c r s y I believe and he's got a facility in uh I believe Boston as well as in Florida so he's very very involved in pitching as well as hockey and things like that so um he has so many free videos and resources on a on so much of the shoulder girdle mostly because he he's dealt with overhead and throwing athletes and so the Precision required there is tremendous so you want to be very careful when you start playing in this area because the wrong positioning of your scapula can cause a whole bunch of problems in your neck and low back and so he would be a great resource to go take a look at that um depending on how your your scapula are gliding and sliding and the way that you want your rotator cups firing ing um your rhomboids there's it gets like very complicated very quickly so you want to learn more go there as a very very quick couple of answers um one of my favorite exercises is is lying on a bench or or putting some bench and then just doing a reverse fly basically um the reason I like stabilizing the rest of the body is so you can make sure you can focus on just using those rear doids and putting your scapula in the right position now there's a there's a specific set of queuing that you want the scapula to move down and back for again check out uh or any number of folks in that area to do it but that that's a very simple way the reverse fly to get there great and then in terms of neck exercises I was told to avoid Bridges because they can cause damage to the discs I will probably never do a bridge ever uh the rest of my life so um isometrics are are a great exercise for that because if you think about what uh what you're asking muscle groups to do in the neck you mostly want it to be able to do a certain type of rotation a little bit of flex and extension um and some some other movements but in general it should be being stable um so you want to walk through these joints asking kind of what they do are they a moving joint or they a stability joint in this case you want to do there so isometrics are going to put you in a much better position there's some actually pretty cool devices that you can wear and you can put them on your head and you can do all kinds of movement um and get some great training there those are great starts but if you don't have any of that just basic isometrics are a great way to go about it um neck Bridges would not be on that list for me no neck Bridges folks in terms terms of sets and repetitions we briefly touched on this but anywhere from probably six repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions but probably more in the 8 to 15 repetition range for hypertrophy most of the time yeah and I'll just throw in there because I I love this idea that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation related to strength and hypertrophy that 7 to n range that the No Man's uh or and no woman's uh land of of training repetitions I always joke in class I'm like okay we we go through the whole thing right you're like 1 to five strength 8 to 12 you know hypert Tre and they're like great and then I'm like okay so six to N means nothing will happen at all and the kids are just like writing it down like right good way to for everybody to remember that there are adaptations triggered in the six to9 rep range and it's a balance of strength and height you'll just get thrown out of any gym that I'm a part of fantastic if you do that uh so but the important point is to get close to failure and occasionally hit failure maybe occasionally throw in a force repetition or a rest pause where you rest and then do a few more something like that but those intensity increasing Maneuvers will uh require a little bit more attention to recovery either time or or attention in some other way and here's a little bit of carot all throut people because people generally don't like to be told to not go to failure that often right so so there's a handful of like half the folks are like sweet I don't have to train that hard to get there and those folks it's like well yes but I also said you just can't like do a half workout you have to get pretty darn close to failure and most people don't really know a failure means so for that group it's actually it's still probably harder than you think you want to train for the other group though that like wants to completely blow themselves out every single time dragging them back is is more the key now for those folks here's what I can say if you make sure that your hidden stressors invisible stressors are completely taken care of you can go to failure a lot more often and so you need to dial those things in and then now you can go hammer yourself because you'll recover so much quicker and we see this very commonly um in all of our programs with with our athletes and and our non-athletes that when we get that the rest of the Hidden invisible stressors taken care of their training volume goes up so much because they'll just start coming back and they're just like oh my God I'm not sore anymore oh my God I'm not nearly as sore I did this exact workout you know countless times before and now I'm doing it and I'm not sore at all anymore what the hell like we didn't do anything different with the programming or really the nutrition but we got the rest of that allostatic load under control and boom things take off it's a lot like drivers so many people seem to be riding the brake and so many people seem to be heavy on the accelerator yeah that's actually one of the ways we describe it is like you want to go faster people's inclination step one is to hit the gas our our step number one is making sure your left foot's not on the brake you'll go faster with less resistance which means you'll actually wear down the system a lot slower by just taking your foot off the brake first if you're then not going fast enough enough now we can push the accelerator but I'm not pushing that accelerator while your foot's still on the brake you're going to go a little bit faster but not as fast as you should be going with that much work and you're going to start wearing down brake pedals and things like that so I like that analogy so so hitting that 10 to 20 sets per week repetition range is pretty broad provided you get close to failure hit failure every once in a while could be the final set of each exercise or maybe do one workout where you hit failure on everything but then you don't do it for a few more again there there sounds like there a lot of play in the system here rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds all the way up to 3 or 4 minutes depending on how heavy you're training and how close to failure or to failure maybe even quote unquote Beyond failure if there is such a thing you're training um throwing in negatives and things like that we didn't get into really high-intensity techniques but people again vary in the extent to which they're they're pushing the system but there does seem to be some value to mixing up the rest between set range across exercises and across workouts but you could combine them all in the same workout is what I heard yep and then in terms of progression it sounds to me like the goal in hypertrophy training is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar although that's one way one could do it but that the progression actually can arrive through this really extensive kit of changing the speed of movement changing um the number of sets adding some volume um maybe changing the split so that you go from a 3-day Week full body workout to more of of a um body parts one or two body parts per day every other day or two on one off at any number of different variations that are out there sounds like all of these can and will work provided that people are obeying the general principles of this uh hypertrophy adaptation inducing protocol that you described and that they are meeting the necessary but not sufficient variables as well such as sleep yeah nutrition and managing the stress in the rest of their life do I have that correctly yeah that's really really good uh one more thing I'd like to add is this is a situation for hypertrophy in which there are some exercises that I actually don't think are good ideas so I want to make sure we we included those in the conversation um that's not necessarily a case for strength you can really do kind of whatever when you want and that is specifically Plyometrics although in fact if you look at um there's a a recent review paper came out showing that like plan metrics are effective as well right sounds like one can do almost anything as long as it falls within this parameter set the concepts are few and the methods are many and the methods for hypertrophy are many many in general though Plyometrics are not my first second or even like 100th Choice um for hypertrophy they if they're a part of a total training program and you get some herper as a result cool you're lucky not the first place I'm going the other major category are weight lifting variations so then when I'm saying weightlifting I mean specifically Olympic weightlifting as in Snatch clean and jerk and their variations those are just not a good exercise Choice it's not that they don't work it's just the risk the benefit ratio starts to fall pretty fast in a in the negative favor and so it's just not worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch unless you're in a sport where that's like the competition or whatever but if the goal is simply hypertrophy um choose different exercises than that great now I realized that we are going to do entire episodes related to nutrition supplementation recovery Etc but I'd like to just touch on two or three specific topics and questions that come up a lot around the question of hypertrophy specifically and that probably also relate to strength training and training for Speed so I'm going to ask these in um not rapid fire but I'll give you shorter answers so that way so I will ask these questions now but with the caveat that we will get into these Topics in much more depth yeah very soon the first question is about the use of cold showers and Ice baths and cold water exposure which I know many people use for resilience training to increase their dopamine which it does and for recovery but there's also this issue of when one should use cold that is deliberate cold exposure relative to hypertrophy training specifically and that's because I've heard that if Del CBC cold exposure is done too soon after a hypertrophy adaptation inducing workout yeah right all the sorts of things we've been talking about that the hypertrophy response can be blunted reduced or eliminated is that true and if so when could people do deliberate cold exposure while still also including hypertrophy training in their program and still get hypertrophy great so you know I'm a lover of the cold I I still have a deep freezer uh in my house that is filled with water at times that I plugged in and and is a frozen chamber I still do the old school style of it please unplug it before you get in it each time oh yes absolutely and then don't do it by yourself so that the lid can close on top of you and then we don't see you sort of ever again Han the Han Solo effect it's time for me to upgrade and get one of these new fancy ones but I've been using this for so many years so I love it um obviously I've been involved with xpt and and Gabby and lar and and Brian McKenzie and these folks so I've been doing this stuff for a long time I've but I don't even know how many hundreds of folks into the ice and done for a lot of reasons so there are a lot of benefits and we can talk about those later however that that being said it is very very true you do not want to get in the ice post hypertrophy training you wouldn't want to do that immediately after the workout you probably don't want to do it before the workout and you probably don't even want to do it that same day um it it's just not worth it it will blunt hypertrophy and specifically we've talked earlier about what's driving muscle growth is that signaling Cascade uh through that gene expression through that muscle proten synthesis cold exposure blocks that signal remember adaptation comes from stress you've put in a stressin now you've blocked that stress you've literally block the signal that tells your body come back and grow larger size so not a good idea to do it if you're training for some other purposes maybe strength maybe there's an argument there although maybe not um for Speed and power maybe you can get away with it endurance maybe a separate conversation if you're in season I have no problem using it immediately after a game the goal is entirely different even if we did a hypertrophy type of training program we're not doing it try to try to maximize growth in that particular case our priority for Recovery is higher than our priority for muscle growth so we choose optimization in that category you can only make those choices though when you truly understand what is the goal for the day the week the month the phase of training and really what part of the year you're in we have that all plotted out for for all the people we work with so I know when we want to choose one over the other it's not a this is the choice you always make sit generation that's just not how we operate we need more Precision than that so that being said we're generally not going to do it if we want to do a lot of icing during a phase in which we're um using a lot of hypertrophy we're going to do a couple of things number one we may just not use it so there are phases in our training where I don't want to maximize recovery I'm not going to give you any tricks here I'm not going to do ice or any of the other methods we're going to talk about why because the whole point is to cause overload that's what's going to be the stimuli to cause adaptation if all I'm doing is blocking that stuff attenuating it smashing it back down I'm undercutting myself I'm choosing to feel a little bit better to have a little bit better performance right now knowing that's going to compromise the results I'm going to get 6 8 10 12 weeks from now right so I'm not going to choose it at all in the reality of it is if I really am trying to maximize hypertrophy I'm probably not doing any ice work during that whole phase maybe like my off day I know that's similar to a setup you have like one day a week when I'm not training we'll jump in some ice maybe even do some hot cold contrast um I I love the xpt protocol it's you know you've probably talked about it before that's a great setup um or or just not do it at all right it's just not something we need when we move into another phase of training where we're trying to maximize adaptation or maximize the result and and get the benefit of that training now we're going to hedge more towards recovery and we're going to bring in some of these strategies and techniques and not worry about causing the most stimuli there because we're trying to a CU we're trying to actualize the work we did 6 8 10 12 weeks before what about cold showers do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect as in general no in general you can do cold showers that's not going to be a problem you're not going to be in there very long and you're not going to get nearly as cold um as you will submerge in 30° ice water for like that the way that we do it nonetheless so um I have no problem standing in the shower for a couple of minutes um using it for other reasons if if you want to that's no issue I'd like to talk a little a little bit about nutrition and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy Dr Lane Norton who's been a guest on the hubman Lab podcast and we both know throughout a number range related to protein intake on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis can occur by meal across the day Etc a lot of lot of research done there and some important work by him in particular and then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight being the lower end of the range up to I believe is it was as high as 2.4 maybe even as high as 2.7 yep grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day that's a pretty broad range but it's on the higher end of what I think most people think of in terms of protein intake and then again some people might already be right there or maybe even above that value of course this all depends on whether or not people are omnivore vegan uh meat-based Etc we won't even go there but assuming people are getting enough protein per day so somewhere in that range and they are spreading out that protein intake to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate a certain amount of protein in any given sitting what do you like to see people ingest at some point post hypertrophy inducing workout in order to get the protein synthesis Advantage if you will yeah that is stimulated by that workout earlier you mentioned the you know the post trining feeding window that you know in the 90s and probably earlier people were talking about oh you know within the first 90 minutes you have to get amount oh was it 30 minutes of uh excuse me a certain number of grams of carbohydrate and protein Etc I think now the understanding is that that window is much broader MH um and uh how broad and Etc is is still a matter of debate but when somebody is trained specifically for hypertrophy assuming they are getting enough protein from quality sources in their other meals and assuming that their overall macronutrient intake and caloric intake is high enough that is they have enough of a caloric Surplus that they have the the raw materials for for hypertrophy what do you like to see people ingest at some point post-workout in order to facilitate muscle protein synthesis and recovery and this could include nutrition and supplementation if you want to divide those answers out um feel free to do so of course yeah okay great so a ton of work came out of Don Layman's La was actually Lan's Mentor as well as Stu Phillips at McMaster so a ton of work there and we can answer a number of things here so Lane's numbers that he recommended uh also known as about a gram of protein per pound of body weight it's a great start now once you slide below that's per pound right one gr per pound right and earlier we just to make sure because we're changing units here uh it was 1.6 gr per kilogram of body weight all the way up to I think it was 2.4 but maybe as high as 2.7 yeah um grams of protein per kilogram of body weight so 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing so 2.2 grams per kilogram is the same as one gram per pound right so depending on which where you're listening at to this at one of those may be easier than the other for you um if you start getting below that number now you do start running into questions of protein quality protein type and protein timing this is one of the reasons why I fully agree with Lane is just get that number higher than you think and then all those other variables don't matter if that number is low then you need to start paying attention to a bunch of other stuff you've added now complexity to your program things you got to pay attention to just stay high and it it doesn't matter and so you can just leave a lot of those things off the table that seems to be fairly clear in in the work of some of those gentlemen I just mentioned that as long as you get to that total number the question about timing and um types and quality it seems to matter a lot less in fact uh ste's recent work in non-animal-based proteins it really showed that to be fairly clear that those are quite effective assuming total protein intake is high enough um the amount of Lucine and other amino acids in those actual proteins matter less if the total threshold is just super high so just do that and you're fine um now the other caveat we have to say here is timing of macronutrients is seems to be somewhat Irrelevant for protein but that is not the case for carbohydrates so that timing does matter replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific and you want to make sure that that is around a lot if you're doing either maintaining training quality or you're sliding into endurance type of work and so nutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates maybe less so with protein and certainly less so with protein if the total protein ingestion is high enough so um it depends on what we're going after in terms of a training goal um and where we want to get with all these things in general the way that we like to think about this is if you're doing a strength type of work where you're truly targeting that then a one: one post exercise protein to carbohydrate ratio is generally what we're going to go after so this would be something like 35 grams of protein 35 grams of carbohydrate it doesn't have to be post it can be pre or my favorite is actually mid um or post but somewhere in that range especially if you're training in the morning and you have not consumed anything prior to your workout and that's not necessarily eating in the middle of the workout that's drinking calories yeah it's going to be I yet to see someone eating a sandwich on uh in the although I'm sure it's happened yeah so one to one is that like sort of standard number here um if you're going to do sort of more of a really hard conditioning workout that number slides up to something like three or even four to one which would be carbohydrate to protein ratio so if we want to stay at 35 grams of protein we're going to go maybe as high as like 100 or 140 grams of carbohydrate again depending on what type of of training we're sorted doing if you're going to do a little bit of a combination then you like a little bit of strength a little a little bit of conditioning and kind of a standard workout which is probably something that a lot of people will do then you maybe want to go to something like 2 to one so you know 35 grams of protein 60 70 grams of carbohydrate and those are kind of just like rough numbers that you can go by and for Pure hypertrophy training would you like to see people ingest some carbohydrate post training for Pure hypertrophy training I want to see that as many of those nutrients around the training as generally possible now again I may change my mind when our fasting study comes out but as it stands now there is no advantage to not fueling around the training and there are some known and some other potential advantages to fueling so I just see no reason to not do it um in fact most people are generally going to do better now this is not science this is just my coaching experience um and this is with our athletes and all of our non-athletes that we've worked with and do work with they're just going to be better spreading those meals out generally throughout the day and and they're going to be better if they have those nutrients either pre mid or post and so they're going to get even for hypertrophy they're going to get something like that one 3 to one ratio of carbs to protein personal preference some people don't like to eat before they train some people have to eat before they train some people can't you know put in food in their belly immediately after work around that you can you can play based on personal preference but we want that fueling in there um because we want to maximize the potential growth and we want to just get a jump start on recovery because we're going to be training again pretty soon supplementation is a huge topic and one that we will go into in great depth in a soon to occur episode but if you had to pick one supplement that can benefit most everybody if not everybody yeah for their training directed toward strength power and hypertrophy what would that supplement be and how would you like to see people use it meaning how much should they take and when should they take it sure if you don't count protein and carbohydrates as supplements they technically are but we'll just walk out of that right sorry I I should be more specific I'm not referring to uh nonfood form um protein and carbohydrate so powdered protein and pow powdered carbohydrate Etc um technically are supplements they're highly processed but they're um but I'm not including that I'm I'm referring to um non- macronutrient type supplements yeah does testosterone count um well in the context of this discussion it's testosterone that people are manufacturing themselves ah okay the cheating kind the endogenous kind no um I mean [ __ ] is the answer here without question it is the most well studied it is the most effective and its uh benefits are robust meaning they're going to confer positive adaptations across multiple physiological domains so we could certainly have a very long chat about some of the interesting things that people in fact we just had um Darren kandal um on on our barble shrug podcast and he went into extensive detail about all the benefits of creatin that people have no idea about including things like bone mineral density you asked about that earlier creatin is actually fairly effective for that um let alone the thing uh the benefit in things like cognitive function decision- making memory um the work that there being done there for neurological disorders um depression a whole host of things that that creatine is being studied for some uh of those studies show a lot of benefit some of it show maybe a little bit some none but there's just a lot of things creatine can do um so when we could talk about Muscle Recovery or muscle hypertrophy um that's where the bulk of the research is and and it and it's very effective um in terms of type creatin monohydrate is still the best one and that's just because it has the largest evidence base um you can maybe make some arguments for some other types but you're really going to reach saturation pretty quickly within a matter of weeks and there um at a dosage of anywhere between like 3 to six grams per day um now five grams is the very standard number we give reality is I change that number based on size that's just the honest truth um if you're 225 PBS you're not going to get the same dosage of creatin as 125 pound girl that's just just like this is not what we're going to do so we may slide that number down a little bit closer to three for the the smaller girl boy doesn't matter it's just Fe physical size if you're one of our 275 or 330 lb offensive right tackles in the NFL you're not going to get the same same dosage as everybody else so that number is going to go up to seven 8 n maybe even 10 grams a day there so that's just kind of the scale in general if you wanted an easy answer for five grams is the standard taken after training the timing doesn't matter totally irrelevant take it in the morning breakfast take it at night take it anytime you want take it pre um we tend to put it in a lot of people's um workout um shakes just to make sure they get it in throughout the day but the timing is irrelevant great well thank you for that very informative answer and I look forward to much more discussion about nutrition and supplementation and recovery and all the rest in the episodes to come this was incredibly informative thank you so very much I appreciate the

Title: How to Optimize Fertility in Males & Females
Published: 2023-01-23 12:00:10 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age. 

Note: At the timestamp related to cumulative probability of pregnancy (2:01:30), I misspoke, my apologies. The data in the following graph are correct but the “120%” is not. 

The appropriate equation is 1-(1-p)^n where p is the probability of getting pregnant in a given cycle and n is the cycle number. Therefore the equation for this scenario is 1-(0.8^6). 

Using the equation, cumulative probability over 6 cycles is 73.8% (rounded to 3 significant figures).

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing fertility. We will discuss male fertility and female fertility. And I should mention that today's discussion is not just for people who are seeking to conceive children or who want to know how their children were conceived, but it's really for everybody. And I say that because it is the story of all of us. All of us are here because a specialized set of cells, called germ cells-- that is the sperm and the egg. And I'll make it very clear why they're called germ cells a little bit later. It has nothing to do with infection. But it's because a sperm cell and an egg cell arrived at one another, either in vivo-- inside of our mother-- or in vitro-- so-called in vitro fertilization-- and then we're implanted into our mother and became us. And so understanding the process of how the egg cell and the sperm cell came to be is really the key to understanding how that fertilization process came to be. Now, I know everyone's thinking, I know how fertilization occurs. It occurs through sexual intercourse and so on. And we'll talk a little bit about that. But I promise you that if you understand the menstrual cycle-- and the menstrual cycle in today's conversation can best be thought of as a biological cycle that occurs in females that allows the potential for fertilization by the sperm, because that's really what it is, and it's a beautifully orchestrated process that I'll describe to you. And I should say, all people, males and females, should really understand how the menstrual cycle works, how it impacts fertilization, but also how it impacts the brain and body, behavior, psychology, et cetera. And we'll also talk about spermatogenesis, how sperm cells come to be and how they arrive-- that is, how they swim to the egg-- and the incredible interplay between the biology of the sperm and the biology of the egg leads to this incredible thing that we call embryogenesis and the birth of the child and, of course, the development of that child into an infant, a toddler, an adolescent, a teen, and an adult. Today's discussion, again, is not just for those of you that are seeking to have children. And I say that because when you look at the data, you look at the literature on longevity and vitality, two themes in biology that oftentimes people lump together but aren't always the same-- for instance, there are a lot of things that we can do to increase our vitality that actually can harm our longevity. But there are a subset of biological rules and mechanisms that, when aligned, allow us to maximize both our vitality and our longevity. And I think it's fair to say that all of those mechanisms and tools are housed in the discussion around maximizing fertility. And that's true whether or not you're male or female. In other words, if you want children or if you don't, if you already have children or if you don't, understanding how fertility and fertilization occurs in the brain and body will allow you to maximize your vitality and longevity. And of course, today's discussion will provide an understanding of the biology and many actionable tools that will also help you conceive children, if that's your wish. So of course, as is characteristic of this podcast, we will discuss science-based tools, including behavioral tools, both the dos and the don'ts, and we will discuss nutrition-based tools and supplementation-based tools and some other practices, including things like acupuncture, which have quite good data to support them in terms of improving fertility. And we will discuss why those certain practices can work. And we will discuss prescription drugs that your doctor can prescribe to you if, for instance, you have a deficit at the level of hormone production or neurotransmitter production at the level of the brain or the pituitary gland-- I'll explain what all of those things are soon-- or the gonads, the ovary and the testes in females and males respectively. Again, by the end of today's episode, you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related to maximizing fertility, and you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related to maximizing vitality and longevity. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Meats. Maui Nui Meats, I can confidently say, are the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. Maui Nui he spent nearly a decade building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui. The solution they built turns the proliferation of an invasive species into a wide range of nutrient-dense products, from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats to bone broth, jerky, and even pet treats. Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100 calories. I've talked before on this podcast and I've had several expert guests come on this podcast to talk about the fact that most people should aim to get 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight per day in order to maximize their health, tissue repair, which includes brain tissue repair, and, if you're an active exerciser, to support recovery from exercise. Maui Nui Meats have an incredible quality protein to calorie ratio. And I mentioned the bone broth. I should also mention that their ground meats and their venison steaks are absolutely delicious, and their jerky is absolutely terrific. In fact, it's the only jerky that I've eaten consistently that I happen to like consistently over time.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now, one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep every single night is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment. Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And waking up, on the other hand, involves a heating of your body by about 1 to 3 degrees. With Eight Sleep, you can tune the temperature of your mattress cover or mattress to be cooler or hotter, depending on whether or not you tend to run too hot or too cold, and you can even vary it across the night so that you can access the best deep sleep early in the night, the so-called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, that's more pronounced in the later half of the night and in doing so really get your sleep optimized, not just in terms of duration but in terms of quality and the overall architecture of your sleep. This has a profound influence on your alertness, focus, mood, and many other important factors throughout the day. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover. Today's episode is also brought to us by Momentous Supplements. I want to acknowledge that not everybody needs supplements, and yet many, many people derive tremendous benefit from proper supplementation. I would count myself in that group. There are excellent supplements for improving the depth and quality of sleep, for improving focus, and for improving energy and for hormone optimization and many other factors related to our mental health, physical health, and performance. We've partnered with Momentous Supplements for three important reasons. First of all, Momentous supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, they ship internationally, and we know that many of you reside outside of the United States. And third, they focus on single ingredient formulations. This is very important. There is a place for blends. But in most cases, if you're going to develop a supplement protocol, you want it to be single-ingredient formulations so that you can adjust the dosages of different things according to what works and doesn't work for you, which is essentially impossible to do if you are using multi-ingredient formulations.

Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman to get 20% off. Let's talk about fertility. And in doing so, let's take a step back from this word "fertility" and ask, what is fertility and fertilization really all about? Well, the obvious answer is that it's about producing offspring. But more importantly, it's about producing offspring that contain the genetic components of both parents and indeed contain half of the genes from one parent and half of the genes from another parent. Now, there are two general types of cells in the body. The most common types of cells in the body are called somatic cells. So these would be all the cells in your body except the egg in females and the sperm in males. The egg in females and the sperm males are part of what's called the germline. And again, it has nothing to do with infection. It's just that the cells of the germline have genes that cannot be modified by the behavior of the individual that houses those genes. What do I mean by that? Well, if I were to tell you that by exercising you can improve mitochondrial function, you can change hormones by reducing stress, you can reduce cortisol by hitting puberty, for instance, you will have the secretion of hormones that then change gene expression in other cells, leading to the development of body hair, facial hair, deepening the voice, breast growth, et cetera, you'd say, OK, great. Yeah, that all makes perfect sense. But that's all occurring in the so-called somatic cells. The germ cells or the germline cells-- that is, the egg and the sperm-- are a very unique and protected set of cells that are generated in a particular way and whose genetic components are not modifiable by experience. And when you take a step back and you think about it, you say, oh, that's right. There's no reason to think that exercising will make the children that you have not yet had stronger. And you say, of course not. Well, why is that? Well, that's because there is a barrier between the genes of the germline cells and behaviors. They cannot be modified by behaviors and the various things that you do in your lifetime. Now, I suppose there's an exception in the negative direction. And what I'm referring to here is if you were to, say, be exposed to a chemical that could mutate the DNA of your egg or sperm or if you were to fertilize an embryo in a certain way or at a certain stage of life that it got an extra chromosome, for instance-- we'll talk about this a little bit later-- well, then, of course, you could end up with offspring that have modified DNA that don't faithfully represent half of the genes from mom and half of the genes from dad. But that's not the same as specific behaviors modifying the genes of those cells-- the sperm and the egg cells-- in a way that improves the offspring. So the key first thing to understand today is that there's a distinction between somatic cells, which is the vast majority of cells in your body, and the so-called germline cells, which are the egg and the sperm. The egg and the sperm are these highly protected populations of cells that, in females, actually come to be during embryogenesis. So for all females out there, you generate what today I'm going to refer to as a vault of cells. You have a vault of eggs that are your germline. Those eggs all contain all the chromosomes of your DNA. So it's going to be-- as most of you know, there are 23 chromosomes, and chromosomes exist in pairs. So the way to think about this is each pair is one strand, and you have 22 so-called autosomes, and then you have one sex chromosome. The sex chromosome will be either X or Y. So in a female, they have two X chromosomes. So in each one of the eggs that a woman has and that she's had since she was an embryo and that's contained in this vault, those eggs are, of course, going to be very immature at birth. She hasn't undergone puberty yet. And certainly, as an embryo, she hasn't undergone puberty. And those cells are going to contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. This is very important-- 23 pairs of chromosomes. The chromosomes are essentially the wrapped-up DNA that contains all the genetic information to create any cell type in the body and actually to create an entirely new individual. Now, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 of which are called autosomes. If that doesn't make sense to you, just remember, autosome, OK, there's 22 of them. And then there's one so-called sex chromosome. The sex chromosomes are either X or Y. But this is a female, so she's going to have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and she's going to have two X chromosomes for the sex chromosomes. If this is already confusing to you, don't worry, I'll make it very clear how this all relates to fertility and how it relates to chromosomal segregation and a bunch of things that I think maybe you've heard of and that perhaps were opaque to you. But I promise to make them clear. But just understand that, within each of those eggs, they have 23 pairs of chromosomes. And for those of you that like nomenclature, I'll tell you that those cells are considered diploid. They're called the diploid, and that means that they have 23 pairs of chromosomes, as distinguished from cells that are haploid where there's only one set of those 23 chromosomes. So instead of 23 pairs, there's only 23 chromosomes. We'll come back to haploid cells a little bit later. So when a female is born, she has all these eggs in the reserve, in this vault, that she'll have for her entire life. She's not going to make any more. But they are very, very immature. So when a woman is in embryogenesis, she develops these very immature eggs. Today we're also going to talk about follicles, and we will be careful to distinguish follicles from eggs. They're often talked about interchangeably, online and elsewhere and even by fertility docs and OB/GYNs. But right now we're just talking about the egg cells, the eggs themselves, which are cells. Now, the goal of fertilization is to bring that egg cell into close enough proximity that it can be fertilized by a single sperm cell. And that sperm cell will bring 23 chromosomes, as well, that include-- just as in the female egg, it'll have 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome. And in the male, that sex chromosome can either be an X chromosome, which then would give rise to female offspring, or a Y chromosome, which would give rise to male offspring. And today we're not talking about sexual differentiation. That's a topic of a previous and yet another future episode. But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes and Y chromosomes can actually accomplish that sexual differentiation, both of body and brain. I'll just mention in two sentences that, for instance, if there's a Y chromosome as opposed to an X chromosome, that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress, for instance, the development of female genitalia and thereby give rise to male genitalia. So rather than the formation of a clitoris, it's the formation of a penis. And rather than the formation of ovaries, the formation of a testes. So that's more directed towards sexual differentiation. We're not going to get into that right now. We'll get into that in a future episode. But even if you're only tracking about 10% of what I'm saying right now, I promise you're doing great. If you're tracking more than 10%, well, then you're doing terrifically well, because the essence of fertility and fertilization is to bring together that haploid cell that is the sperm that only has 23 chromosomes-- but not pairs of chromosomes because that's the DNA from dad-- together with the egg, which, as I told you already, has 23 pairs of chromosomes. So part of the fertilization process has to be to get rid of one half of those 23 pairs in the female. You got to get rid of it, and you have to get the egg and the sperm in proximity so that the egg can potentially be fertilized by the sperm bringing the DNA, the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad, into a cell that has 23 single strands from mom. So I realize I'm probably being a little bit repetitive here, but I want everyone to understand this because it really frames up fertility and reproduction in the proper way. We've got a cell from mom, the egg, which has 23 pairs of chromosomes. We need to get rid of one set of those pairs so that there's only 23 chromosomes. We need to get rid of half of those chromosomes. And then we need to bring that cell together physically with the sperm cell that contains the 23 chromosomal strands from dad. And we need to bring those together so that you get 23 chromosomal pairs from dad and 23 chromosomal pairs from mom. And in doing so, you create a cell, which then becomes multiple cells. That's going to be the developing embryo that has half the genes from mom and half the genes from dad. So I hope that's clear. That is the biological logic, which I realize is a bit of a tongue twister. But forgive me. It is the most accurate way to describe this process. We're trying to bring together the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad and the 23 single strands of chromosomes from mom into the same cell. Now, that requires a literal physical contact and pairing of the two cells. But as I mentioned before, all these eggs in mom are sitting in a vault, and they're very, very immature. So the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle are really about first eliminating half of the chromosomal pairs in that 23 sets of chromosomes and not getting rid of, for instance, half-- just going 1 to 11 or 12 to 23. That's not the goal. The goal is to have chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all the way up to 23, but only to have half of the chromosomes there and to bring that cell together with the sperm cell, physically, then allow them to fuse and allow the chromosomes from dad and the chromosomes from mom to fuse within a single cell and duplicate into cells that contain half of the chromosomes from dad and half of the chromosomes from mom. That's what the ovulatory and menstrual cycle are really all about. So when thinking about it that way, I'd like to just initiate the discussion by focusing first on the female component, or the egg component, of fertility and fertilization. As I mentioned before, a female has all the eggs, albeit very immature eggs, that she's going to have at the time that she's born. Now, puberty will happen at some point and will allow the ovulatory and the menstrual cycle to commence. Now, one question that you perhaps are asking is, what controls the onset of puberty? And there are a number of different results, each of which could be an entire episode of a podcast on its own. But I'll just highlight a few things that we know about the onset of menses or menstruation, or it's sometimes also called a menarche. One thing that you'll notice about today's discussion is that if you were to take any number of your notes online and put them into a search function that you would see a lot of different language used for the same thing. So for instance, some people will talk about the egg and the follicle as the same thing, even though they are not. I'll explain the difference soon. Some people will talk about menses or menstruation or menarche as the exact same thing. And in fact, they are not the exact same thing, but oftentimes these words are used interchangeably. I'll do my best today to not overload you with nomenclature but rather to use the most commonly used terms for the different aspects of fertility and fertilization. But when it comes to the onset of puberty, first of all, most of you have probably heard that the onset of puberty is happening much earlier in females now than it was some years ago. And in fact, that is the case. And I'll talk about some statistics related to this which are pretty striking but don't necessarily point to anything detrimental. It doesn't necessarily mean that something bad is happening. What do we know for sure? Well, we know that there are a number of signals that come both through the brain and through the body-- and more likely both-- in order to control the onset of puberty in females. A couple of examples-- the first is a mechanistic one. We know, for instance, that the entire process of the ovulatory menstrual cycle is initiated from the brain. We're going to get into this in a lot more detail in a few minutes. But there's a certain number of hormones and neurotransmitters that are communicated from the brain, a structure called the hypothalamus, which roughly sits above the roof of your mouth, and that communicates with a gland, an endocrine or hormone-releasing gland called the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland looks like a stalk that essentially extends out of the brain. It's also located not far from the roof of your mouth. And that has two sort of small marble or grape-sized protrusions, the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. And they release different hormones into the bloodstream. Puberty is in part controlled by the fact that, up until puberty, there are neurons in the hypothalamus that release a neurotransmitter called GABA, which is inhibitory, and that prevents the neurons in the hypothalamus from releasing a very important hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH. So the first thing I'd really like everyone to know and commit to memory today is very easy-- GnRH stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone. This comes from the brain and will communicate to the pituitary to release certain hormones. Prior to puberty, in both males and females, there are neurons in the brain that are actively suppressing the neurons that release GnRH. It's like no puberty, no puberty, no puberty. You can't have puberty. You can't have puberty. And in fact, those cells are releasing this neurotransmitter called GABA because it's inhibitory. It prevents the firing of those neurons. So puberty is actively suppressed up until a certain point. It's also actively suppressed, at least in some species and we think at least partially in humans, by the tonic release-- that means the ongoing release, around the clock-- of a hormone called melatonin. Later in life-- in fact, after puberty-- melatonin will be secreted only in the dark phase of each night and around the time that one goes to sleep. But in children and in particular in children prior to puberty, melatonin is released more or less constantly. Now, melatonin isn't the only source of suppression of puberty. It's also these neural mechanisms involving GABA. But it is certainly a great candidate for one of the reasons why puberty doesn't generally tend to happen at, say, age four age five. That would be very unusual. Another component of suppression of puberty is that typically in children they have relatively low body fat stores. Why is this important? Well, we know that one of the things that can trigger the onset of puberty-- in particular in females-- is that when enough body fat accumulates, that body fat releases a hormone called leptin, and that hormone leptin travels in the bloodstream, across the blood-brain barrier, and goes to the hypothalamus and can trigger the onset of puberty by activating the neurons that release gonadotropin-releasing hormone. So many people believe that one of the reasons that puberty is happening earlier and earlier in females is because of the accumulation of more body fat at younger ages than was observed 30 or 40 and certainly 100 years ago. Now, I can already imagine a number of people are thinking, oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis. And indeed, there is a crisis of obesity. Obesity is something that is causing all sorts of problems with people's health at various levels, brain and body, and that is far more frequent today than it was even 20 years ago. So it is indeed a crisis because it has enormous detrimental effects for so many aspects of brain and body health and longevity. But this whole process of thinking about body fat signaling leptin to the hypothalamus and the onset of puberty doesn't necessarily have to do with the obesity crisis. It might relate, but it could also relate to, for instance, improved nutrition, which is allowing body fat stores to accumulate maybe not to the level of obesity but to accumulate earlier and at younger ages in females, which is then causing earlier puberty in females. To just highlight how that might be possible, I want to review some data that talk about the onset of menses, menstruation-- that is, puberty-- in females according to country and according to age over the last 100 or more years. So what are the general trends in terms of the onset of puberty in females? Well, that's an easy one to answer. Over the last 100 years or so, the onset of puberty has been occurring much earlier with each passing decade. It's really an incredible set of statistics. I will provide a link to these data since I know a number of you are listening and not just watching on YouTube. This is from a study in which the onset of puberty has been analyzed from as early as the 1850s-- in certain countries, there are data on that-- out to the 1970s and in other countries starting at about 1900, extending out to about 1990. These are ongoing collections of data. But just to give you a sense of how the data are falling out in a couple of different countries, just to give you a flavor-- but for those of you listening and for those of you watching, the essence of all of these findings is that puberty is happening much, much earlier with each passing decade. So for instance, in the United States, around 1900 or 1903, the average age of menarche, the onset of puberty, in females was about 14 years old, whereas in 1990, the average age is 11. So that's a pretty significant, we can say, acceleration of the onset of puberty. Now, of course, these are averages. So there will be exceptions. There's a distribution of data. Today, still, there will be young females who will undergo puberty at age 11 or 10 or maybe even 9 and others who will undergo puberty at age 13, 14, maybe even 16 or 17. However, if we look at, for instance, the data from Norway, which dates back quite far-- they have excellent record-keeping-- to 1850, what we see is that the average age of the onset of female puberty in 1850 in Norway was 17 years old, whereas in 1970, it's 13 years old. So this is a dramatic acceleration of the onset of puberty. And you see a similar trend in other countries, as well. So if we were to look, for instance, in the UK, they have a smaller data set, meaning it only extends back to about 1940. But the average age of the onset of puberty in the UK in 1940 was 13 and 1/2 years old. Again, this is just for females. And in 1970, it was closer to 13, with a trend towards declining even further. Unfortunately, they didn't continue to collect data out to 2022. And as a final point, if we were to look at, for instance, in Germany and Finland, the average onset of puberty in 1870 was 16 and 1/2 years old. By 1940, it was down to 13 and 1/2 years old. So all of these data have borne out over and over again, regardless of location in the world, which is important, because when you start to think about the obesity crisis, you can say, well, that's mainly in developed countries, believe it or not-- or perhaps not surprisingly. And maybe it has to do with the obesity crisis. And yet I don't think we can conclude that at all. Something is happening, however. It could be increased body fat stores due to overeating and obesity. However, it could also be-- unrelated to obesity, it could be, for instance, improved nutrition and the availability of quality nutrition, which can signal the maturation of the brain and body mechanisms that trigger the onset of puberty, ovulatory cycle, and menstruation. So we want to be very careful about leaping to conclusions about what these trends mean, but the trends themselves are very, very apparent. And as a final point, I should also mention that there are a number of different behavioral and psychosocial, as they're called, interactions that can influence puberty as well. This has been most strikingly observed in animals. And so I don't want anyone to be alarmed or to leap to any great conclusions about the onset of timing of puberty in humans, but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you about a certain result which shows that if a young female is exposed to the odor-- not necessarily the pheromones. There's a distinction between odors that we perceive and pheromones, which are subconscious. We don't actively perceive, but that can impact our biology, and pheromones effects in humans are very controversial. But we know, for instance, that if you take a female animal-- and there's some evidence from humans that if you take a young prepubertal female and you expose her to the scent of a reproductively-competent male for a series of days, but maybe even as short as a few hours, and she is also not regularly being exposed to the scent of her father, that she can undergo puberty earlier. That's right. There is something about the odor and/or pheromones, or perhaps something else, that occurs when a young prepubertal female has a father that she's in regular contact with. He wouldn't necessarily have to live at home but that is around a lot that his smell is registered by her biological systems. That-- I don't want to say protects because it kind of skews the valence of the conversation, but that offsets or buffers the otherwise observed effect, which is that the scent of a reproductively-competent male, if it's present often enough or perhaps intensely enough, that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female. In other words, the scent of a male that is not the father and we think also that is not biologically related to her can trigger earlier onset of puberty. And that effect can at least be partially buffered by her being in the presence of the scent from her biological father. Now, some of you are probably already leaping to conclusions about what this means. Should you not allow your daughter to be exposed to any males who are of reproductive age, et cetera? That's certainly not what I'm saying. There's a huge number of considerations that go into that calculation for everybody and circumstances, et cetera. But the point is that the odors of individuals, both related-- in particular, closely related-- and non-related individuals, can shape the neural systems and the hormone systems that can trigger the onset of puberty or suppress the onset of puberty. So whether or not we're talking about onset of puberty at this age or that age and whether or not biologically-related male or non-biologically-related male scents around, et cetera, the thing I want everyone to know is that at some point during development, typically nowadays between the ages of 11 and 15 or so-- again, there's variability there. The suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone released from the hypothalamus is removed, and then gonadotropin-releasing hormone can activate cells within the pituitary. And if you really want to know, it's the anterior pituitary in particular. And then the anterior pituitary gland, which sits at and kind of bridges the brain and the body because it allows the release of hormones into the bloodstream, that anterior pituitary is going to release two key hormones that everyone should know the name of and what they do. And when I say everyone, I mean males and females need to know about these hormones because they have an active role in both males and females. And of course, you should want to know and should know about the biology of everyone on the planet, in my opinion, because it tells you a lot more about humans than if you just focus on your own biology. But those two hormones are called luteinizing hormone, which is abbreviated LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone, which is abbreviated FSH. So the simple picture that you need to have in your mind is gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the brain, from the hypothalamus in particular, is causing the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, GnRH stimulates LH, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH. LH and FSH travel in the blood and can access all the cells and tissues of the body. This is one of the incredible things about hormones is that many hormones-- and LH and FSH are included in this group-- can travel into cells, and they can actually change the genetic expression of those cells. They can change which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off. And they can also attach to the surface of those cells and make those cells take on different properties. So they can mature those cells. So for instance, a good example of this outside of the context we've been talking about is the hormone testosterone can travel to the hair follicle and can stimulate changes in the genes of the cells of the hair follicle that can make hair grow. A different hormone, estrogen, can travel to the cells of the breast tissue and activate genes that control enlargement of the cells of the breast tissue. Prolactin, a different hormone, can travel to the mammary ducts and control the production and the secretion of milk. And in males, that can actually happen, in certain cases, although it's rare. But prolactin can also travel to areas of the brain that control libido, for instance. And just so you'll never forget it, males' elevated levels of prolactin are actually what set the refractory period after ejaculation and prevent erection for some period of time. So you'll never forget prolactin. The point being that different hormones have different effects on different cells, depending on what cells those are. Estrogen or estradiol is going to have different effects on the breast tissue than it would on skin, although as effects on both. Similarly, when LH and FSH, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, travel in the blood to the gonad and the gonad is an ovary, it will have a certain set of consequences. And when luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone travel in the blood to a gonad and that gonad happens to be a teste, then it will have a different set of biological implications. So let's focus now on what happens when LH and FSH arrive at the ovary. And let's assume now that we're talking about a female who has already undergone puberty, or perhaps we could even frame this in the context of a female who is about to undergo puberty. FSH and LH are now able to be released because she's undergoing puberty. But the same set of processes, essentially, would occur for any point from puberty onward until menopause, which is the depletion of that vault, that ovarian reserve of all those immature eggs.

OK, so we're now going to talk about ovulation and menstruation, and let's just remember what this is all about. This is all about creating the potential for an egg to be fertilized, and that egg needs to have half of the chromosomal pairs, so no pairs, but it's got to have 23 chromosomes just from mom. And we need to position that egg so that the egg can be met by the sperm and that sperm can penetrate that egg and donate its 23 individual strands of chromosomes to that egg so that you can bring together the DNA of dad and the DNA of mom. So the obligatory menstrual cycle occurs when luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone have been released. And the ovulatory/menstrual cycle-- and here I have to kind of pick what I want to call it. I guess to be really accurate, we would just call it the female reproductive cycle, but that includes underneath it both the menstrual cycle, as it's sometimes called, and the ovulatory cycle. So you decide. I'm going to interchangeably discuss the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle. The problem is, when you say menstruation, people often think about just the period, the shedding of the uterine lining when fertilization has not occurred. So if I start saying ovulatory cycle, just keep in mind I'm referring to the entire thing. Now, this is probably also a good opportunity to say that if you heard that the ovulatory/menstrual cycle is 28 days long, that's true in some cases, but that's not always true. It's, on average, 28 days long. There are some females for which the ovulatory cycle will be shorter-- it can be as short as 21 days-- and other females for which it will be 35 days long. Shorter than 21 days and longer than 35 days is rare, although it does occur. One of the key things when thinking about fertility is if you talk to OB/GYNs who are focused on fertility, which I have in anticipation of this episode, they'll tell you that whether or not your cycle is 21 days long or 35 days long is not as much of an issue necessarily unless it's happening to become much shorter or much longer in a kind of erratic way. So if you're somebody who's consistently had 23 day long cycles and all of a sudden you're having 30 day long cycles, that's not necessarily an indication of anything bad. But if it's 21 days one month and it's 30 days the next month and it's 17 days the next month or even if it's always falling within that 21 to 35 day long cycle but it's very variable from each month or every other month or so, you probably want to talk to your OB/GYN because that could indicate a number of different things. Which things could it indicate? Well, that will become clear as I spell out the biology in a bit more detail. But this idea that the menstrual cycle/ovulatory cycle is always 28 days, that's just false. That's just not true. I should also mention that there is a common misconception that because the average menstrual cycle is 28 days-- indeed, the average is 28 days-- and the lunar cycle is 28 days-- and of course, there is a real biology to support the fact that the lunar cycle can't, in fact, impact certain aspects of human behavior. It does, and we'll talk about lunar cycles in a future episode. But there is zero data to support the idea that the menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle are linked in any kind of causal way. Sorry to break it to you. The lunar cycle and the tidal cycles at the ocean are definitely linked in ways that are super interesting related to the tilt of the Earth and the pull of gravity of different planets, and it's an incredible story into itself. But the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle, despite having some weak correlation in terms of their duration or their so-called periodicity-- no pun intended-- well, there's no causal relationship whatsoever between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle. If any of you are aware of any real data that conflicts with what I just said, please put that in the comment section on YouTube. But this is pretty well established as far as I know. OK, so we need to bring together the so-called haploid contents, the 23 individual strands of chromosomes from the egg, to a place and a position where it could potentially be fertilized by the male. So what happens? Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone travel to the ovary. These hormones are able to access the ovary. There's a lot of blood supply to the ovary. And FSH and LH arrive at the ovary. The ovary has this vault, this ovarian reserve of immature cells. They reside within what are called follicles. The follicles are little spherical packages that can potentially provide a nice environment for those eggs to mature. And when FSH, in particular, arrives at the ovary, a small number of those follicles will split off from the reserve, they will exit the vault, and they will undergo maturation. And the key player here is follicle-stimulating hormone. And the first 14 days of the menstrual/ovulatory cycle is referred to as the follicular phase because of this relationship between FSH triggering the maturation of a subset of follicles. Now, typically in the context of a 28 day or so ovulatory/menstrual cycle, day one is designated as the first day of the period, of the shedding of the uterine lining from the previous ovulatory menstrual cycle in which fertilization did not occur. So day one is when the period initiates. It is days 1 through 14, approximately-- because here we're just considering the average of a 28-day cycle, but it could be longer. It could be shorter. But the first half of that cycle is the so-called follicular phase, FSH, has triggered the departure of a subset of these follicles that contain immature eggs. And it is triggering the maturation of those eggs. Luteinizing hormone is also present, but also at relatively low levels. And it's during the first half of this ovulatory menstrual cycle that the main goal is to get those follicles to mature. So inside of those follicles, the egg is developing. It's growing. It's maturing. And in doing so, it's also making its own hormones. This, I think, is one of the most elegant aspects of the ovulatory menstrual cycle that, in a few minutes, you'll learn about something which still to this day, even though I've known about this stuff for decades now because of my training, still just blows my mind that you have one hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, triggering the maturation of some eggs inside of some follicles and then those follicles themselves making another hormone that furthers the process and then soon, as you'll learn, create a hormone to trigger the second half of the process. Just a beautiful symphony of expression of different genes and different hormones to make everything work as optimally as possible. So as these different follicles mature, somehow-- and we still don't know exactly how-- one of those follicles containing an egg gets selected. It's either because it matures the fastest or there's something about it that is still not completely understood that allows it to be selected. And all the other follicles that are maturing degenerate and die. And they're gone. They don't go back into the ovarian reserve. They are now depleted from that bank account that is the ovarian reserve. They die off. But that single egg that, keep in mind, contains 23 pairs of chromosomes-- we haven't gotten rid of one half of those 23 sets of chromosomes yet. But that one will continue to mature. And then, at some point, that egg will start to undergo a process in which those chromosomes are pulled apart by little components within the egg called spindles. They literally have a physical pulling of the chromosomes apart. So now those 23 pairs are no longer attached to one another at the middle like they were before, like two beads of strings-- or I should say, 23 short strands of beads that were at once connected to one another now are pulled apart so that you have 23 chromosomes on each side, but they're pulled apart from one another. So that diploid cell is now starting to become a cell in which half of the chromosomes, half of those 23 pairs, are physically pulled away from the others. And then the egg actually starts to form its own what we call an involution of membrane around those 23 pairs, one set of them, and encapsulates them. So you sort of got an egg with two parts where the two sets of chromosomes, two sets of 23 chromosomes, are now separate from one another inside of the egg. And then one of those actually gets ejected from the egg, and the name of that thing that gets ejected-- it's sort of like a little Hubble pod is how I imagine it, you know, from Star Wars or from any kind of Space Odyssey movie where some thing is ready to happen. A little Hubble pod shoots out of the ship. Well, that 23 pairs is now ejected from the egg. It's called the polar body. And that's going to degenerate. It's going to go away. And in doing so, take the egg cell, which was once diploid-- it had 23 pairs of chromosomes-- and making it haploid. And now what you've got, in ideal circumstances, is a beautifully pristine egg that was selected for and has 23 single strands of chromosomes, 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome. And that sex chromosome is going to be an X chromosome almost with certainty, because female-- mother-- is creating that egg. So then the egg that contains just the appropriate 23 single-stranded chromosomes is going to fuse with the wall of the ovary, and that egg will be released and will travel into the Fallopian tube. Now, we'll get back to that egg in a few moments. But that process, which represents the first half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle, again, was triggered by FSH and to some extent luteinizing hormone. But it is the ongoing maturation of that egg which also causes the production of estrogen, which allows that whole process to occur. And you could say, why? Well, the answer to the why is a very important biological principle that we are going to return to in a number of different contexts today, both as reference to female and male fertility. And the principle is a so-called negative feedback. So when estrogen is present at relatively low levels in females in the ovary, as it is during the development of these eggs, some of that estrogen, of course, is going to exit the ovary. It's going to go into the bloodstream. And it's going to travel back to the pituitary. Now, the pituitary can release things like follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. But the way I'd like you to think about the pituitary for sake of feedback loops is that it's sort of like a thermometer that you would put into a pool, like a backyard pool, that is attached to the heater. And for instance, if you were to put a thermometer into a pool that you would like to keep at 70 degrees and the temperature of that pool is 60 degrees, well, then that thermometer ought to trigger some sort of mechanism where the pool would heat up until the temperature of the pool hit 70 degrees, and then it should trigger that thermometer to turn off the heating system. That's kind of a negative feedback system that would keep the temperature more or less correct. That's a lot of the way that the system's related to estrogen and also testosterone and these different things like luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone work as well. Typically, when the level of a hormone is too high, then it shuts down the production of the hormones that would trigger further production of that hormone. I know that's a mouthful. It's a lot to think about. And some of you are probably thinking, whoa, I'm getting dizzy now with biology. But I promise you, you can understand this. In females, when estrogen is relatively low-- but not zero but is relatively low during that first follicular half of the ovulatory cycle-- it actually triggers negative feedback on LH and FSH so that not too much is produced. But then just prior to ovulation, the levels of estrogen and the levels of some other hormones from those eggs-- you have the eggs producing estrogen themselves-- gets high enough that it actually triggers a positive feedback loop on the pituitary. So the pituitary is essentially observing the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream produced by the ovary, and the amount of estrogen towards the end of the second half of the menstrual cycle has increased and triggers a positive feedback loop. It triggers the pituitary to release more FSH and LH, and that helps trigger ovulation, that deployment or the release of that one mature proper selected egg that's haploid with the 23 individual pairs of chromosomes into the Fallopian tube. So let's just back up really quickly and just kind of summarize what's happened. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus triggers the release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. That travels to the ovary-- triggers the release of a subset of immature follicles with immature eggs. Those immature follicles and immature eggs start to mature, start to grow because of the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone. The growth of those eggs themselves increases estrogen. As the estrogen starts to accumulate in the environment, some of that travels back to the pituitary. And when levels of estrogen arriving at the pituitary are relatively low, the pituitary says, oh, we don't need to release any more follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone. However, at some point just prior to ovulation, enough estrogen has been produced by that one single selected mature egg and some of the other follicles around it that were maturing but then since died off that the estrogen triggers a positive feedback loop. The pituitary says, OK, and releases more follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. And bam, the egg, which has the proper genetic components, sets off out of the ovary and into the Fallopian tube. So-called ovulation has begun. That itself, what I just described, constitutes the first half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, which we call the follicular phase. And it's marked by the presence of FSH and some other things, but we can really think about it as marked by FSH from the pituitary and by estrogen, or estradiol, made within the ovary. Then comes the second half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, which I personally think is one of the coolest mechanisms in all of biology, which is that-- remember the follicle that housed that one egg that was the selected egg that became the mature egg? And that follicle, which no longer contains the egg because the egg took off and ovulated, is called the corpus luteum. And the corpus luteum starts making three hormones, which include estradiol, I think called inhibin, but the most important hormone, the one that you really need to know about, is that it starts producing very high levels of progesterone. Progesterone levels start to increase about the time of ovulation, although just prior to ovulation. And over the next second half of the ovulatory cycle-- so about 14 days if it's a 28-day cycle, a little bit longer or a little bit shorter, depending on the length of cycle. Levels of progesterone in the second half of the ovulatory cycle are going to increase by 1,400 fold compared to what they were in the first half of the ovulatory cycle. So again, if we were to characterize the menstrual/ovulatory cycle in broad strokes, what we would say is that FSH and estrogen mark the initial part the first half, the so-called follicular phase, and that the estrogen and FSH set in motion ovulation, and they prime the system for the production of a corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. And the second half of all of this is called the luteal phase. The second half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle is the luteal phase because of corpus luteum, this otherwise discarded tissue that produces progesterone. What does progesterone do? Well, progesterone impacts the uterine lining, so-called endometrium or the lining, the mucous lining of the uterus where that egg that's ovulated is potentially going to implant if it's fertilized. And so in a kind of perfect way-- or I should say, in a seemingly perfect way-- the egg is off on its way. It might get fertilized. The remnants of the compartment that let go of that egg produce a hormone that then prepares the endometrial lining of the uterus for the potential implantation of that egg. It's basically making the bed for the fertilized egg to potentially embed in, to implant in, and then achieve all the nourishment that it needs to grow, eventually, into a healthy embryo and child. Just an amazing set of biological mechanisms, if you ask me, because what you're observing here is an incredible economy of function whereby the same cellular components that are producing the egg, well, some of them are being discarded, but they're not being discarded without purpose. They're being discarded in a way that triggers the onset of hormonal expression that then prepares the fertilized egg to be in an enriched environment in which it can thrive. Now, I realize that was a lot of detail. But we have a couple of key themes. We've got the hypothalamus, GnRH. We've got the pituitary with LH and FSH, and those hormones travel to the ovary. The ovary has eggs in a vault, basically immature eggs in a vault. Some of those are activated by the presence of FSH and LH each month. And one of those eggs will be selected and will ovulate. The remnants of the follicle and egg that are not selected, the chromosomes that you don't need disappear in the polar body. And the corpus luteum gives rise to progesterone and sets in motion the second half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle, which is the luteal phase, which is essentially the potential for that fertilized egg to embed in a nice, nourishing environment. And of course, we should all be thinking, if the egg is fertilized and then it lays down in the nice, comfy uterine lining that's been prepared by progesterone in the corpus luteum, well, then everything's fine and good. But what if fertilization doesn't occur? Well, we all know what happens if fertilization doesn't occur. If fertilization does not occur for whatever reason, that uterine lining is going to shed. And that's actually what's referred to as the period. It's the actual removal-- or the departure, rather-- of the thickened endometrium lining of the uterus when fertilization has not occurred. And of course, if that happens, we need another ovulatory menstrual cycle. So how does that happen? Well, the hormone inhibin is also made by the corpus luteum and doesn't go quite as high as the hormone progesterone. But it kind of tracks that increase in progesterone that occurs in the second half of the ovulatory cycle. But then, if fertilization does not occur, inhibin levels start to drop. And what I haven't told you is what inhibin does. Inhibin, in concert with other hormones like estrogen, feed back to the hypothalamus and prevent the further release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. If you have an egg that gets fertilized and can implant, well, then you don't want more eggs to mature. You want to hold on to the ones in the vault. You don't want them to mature. And hormones like inhibin and, again, working with other hormones are going to prevent the secretion of things like FSH and LH. Now, typically, people are not getting pregnant every month. In fact, that's not possible. And part of the reason it's not possible is that if the fertilized egg implants, there are a number of different hormone cascades that shut down the production of things like GnRH, FSH, and LH in ways that prevent further maturation of follicles and a follicular phase. But in the instance where fertilization doesn't occur and menstruation occurs-- and I should mention that the duration of menstruation, the actual bleeding, typically is anywhere from one to five days. The, quote, unquote, "heaviness," the lightness or heaviness of that bleeding will depend on-- you guessed it-- the amount of progesterone that is secreted from the corpus luteum. That's one of the key players there. And if menstruation occurs, well, then inhibin levels also drop. Progesterone levels also drop. And when that occurs, there's a positive feedback signal up at the level of the pituitary. The pituitary literally can register how much inhibin and progesterone and estrogen is present in the bloodstream. And if those levels are sufficiently low, well, then GnRH gets secreted again, FSH gets secreted again, and LH gets secreted again. And the first half the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle initiates all over again. It's hard to overstate how beautifully orchestrated this entire system is-- The number of feedback loops and feed-forward loops. I think if you can just generally understand that the first half of the menstrual/ovulatory cycle is marked by the maturation of the follicles and FSH and that the second half is marked by the accumulation of progesterone and the thickening of the uterine lining should fertilization and implantation occur, I think that you will certainly understand the female reproductive cycle better than most people out there. It will also help you understand a number of things that are sometimes associated with the female reproductive cycle. For instance, there are data showing that, in many, not all, but in many women, in the four to five days prior to ovulation, there is a dramatic increase in libido. That dramatic increase in libido is triggered by a number of things, but some of those things include the spike in FSH that occurs, the spike in LH that occurs, and some associated increases in androgens, things like DHEA and testosterone, which, just as in males can be related to libido, in females trigger libido. You can imagine why this would be an effective mechanism to have in place in females if the goal, as it were, certainly of the egg, perhaps not of the woman as a whole, but if the goal is to fertilize the egg-- so increases in libido just prior to the onset of ovulation. There's also been a lot of discussion and interest and, frankly, data exploring the malaise that it can occur at certain portions of the menstrual cycle. And there's a lot of misconception about this. A lot of people have focused on the malaise that can occur around the time of bleeding. But there are actually stronger data to support the fact that some, again, some, not all women experience a kind of malaise sometimes associated with anxiety, sometimes not, that's associated with the mid to second half of the luteal phase of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle. And that, despite what people commonly think, is not associated with elevated levels of estrogen. It's actually associated with the depletion in estrogen levels that can occur during certain portions of that second half of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. So again, this is highly variable. For some people, they might not experience any malaise at any point during their menstrual cycle. Other individuals also, for instance, might not experience any variation in their libido at any point during their menstrual cycle. Again, highly variable, and yet there are some statistically significant trends that have been observed that tracked very specific hormonal components within the menstrual cycle. Again, this will all be very contextual. And of course, this can play out in a number of different ways. So for instance, some women experience very heightened levels of sensitivity to caffeine at certain portions of their menstrual cycle. Other women experience more cramping than others at different portions of their menstrual cycle. Tremendous variation from individual to individual. One of the-- I view it as an advantage. But one of the things that many females can really do and experience because they have cycles that occur every month that are fairly dramatic in terms of their levels of hormones-- so for instance, a more than 1,000-fold increase in progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and, I should also mention, a 200-fold increase in estrogen during the period just prior to ovulation. That's why they always say estrogen primes progesterone. That's what you learn in kind of basic endocrinology when you're learning the menstrual cycle. Estrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle primes progesterone in the second half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle. Well, those estrogen increases just prior to ovulation are in part responsible for the increases in libido. But it's also the presence of increased androgen just prior to ovulation. So there's a lot of complex interplay. I think what we will do is we will reserve the discussion about libido, per se, and some of the other aspects related to sexual differentiation that we were talking about earlier for a future episode. But hopefully now you have in mind what the ovulatory/menstrual cycle is. It is a signal from the brain, from the hypothalamus, which then triggers a signal from the pituitary, an endocrine gland, which then signals the release of hormones that travel to the ovary and that control two things, maturation of eggs and the identification of one egg in particular and then preparation of the milieu, the environment in which that fertilized egg could potentially land and mature into a healthy embryo and child. So if you have that framed up in your mind and even if you just extracted maybe 10% to 15% of the hormones and different aspects that I described up until now, I would consider you far more knowledgeable about this entire process than 99% of people out there, certainly not the OB/GYNs and urologists, but the 99% of individuals out there. It also frames up for us the second half of this whole story about fertility and fertilization, which is the generation of sperm and how the sperm eventually arrive at the egg and how certain sperm are selected to potentially fertilize that egg, whereas others never really stand a chance. So next we're going to talk about sperm. We're going to talk about what sperm are, where they are generated, and how they are generated, and how they need to travel both within the male and within the female in order to allow fertilization to potentially occur. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So we've covered the ovulatory cycle in females. And I confess, it was a lot of information with a lot of biological nomenclature. But I promise you that many of those same themes and indeed the same names and nomenclature will show up in the discussion that we're going to have now, which is about the generation of sperm. Now, sperm are similar to eggs in the sense that they are part of the germline. They are these protected cells, protected in the sense that the activities of an individual are not going to change the genetic makeup of those cells. Now, again, there are instances in which mutagens, such as chemicals, could disrupt the genomes of the germ cells in males, just as it could in females. But in general, the activities, the things that we do, the experiences we have, doesn't tend to change the genome of those cells. However, there are a lot of lifestyle factors-- dos and don'ts, nutrition and supplements and prescription drugs, et cetera-- that can indeed modify the quality of the sperm. And we'll talk about what sperm quality means. But the point is that the sperm cell, much like the egg cell, are both germline cells. They are not like somatic cells. They are unique populations. And let's just remember what the job of the sperm cell is. The job of the sperm cell is to deliver the genetic material from the father and to do that in the form of a haploid cell. So that means 23 chromosomes, 22 autosomes, one so-called sex chromosome-- again, not sex the verb, at least not in this case. Sex, the verb, is a discussion we're going to have in a few minutes, but sex the noun. The sex chromosome can either be an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. So 22 autosomes and then one sex chromosome is going to be contained within the sperm because it's a haploid cell, not a diploid cell. Remember, the egg was diploid, then it became haploid. The sperm cells are cells that are created through the division of other cells. But after that division occurs through a process called meiosis, the sperm cell is going to contain 23 chromosomes, consisting of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome. And the sperm that manages to deposit its DNA contents into the egg, to fertilize the egg, will either have an X sex chromosome or a Y sex chromosome. And the Y sex chromosome has a number of different genes on that chromosome that will suppress, for instance, the development of the female reproductive axis. One good example would be the Müllerian-inhibiting hormone, or MIH. The gene for Müllerian-inhibiting hormone, which is a hormone that prevents the formation of the Müllerian ducts, which is part of the female reproductive structure, well, that gene controls the prevention of the development of the female genitalia and in doing so promotes the development of the male genitalia. And there are other examples of genes that are on the Y chromosome that give you a what we call male phenotype. You have genotype and phenotype. By the way, in case you haven't heard this in a while from your high school biology-- or if you never heard it, no big deal-- karyotype is the complement of chromosome-- XX or XY. And there are individuals out there that are XXY or XYY, a discussion for our episode on sex differentiation. That's karyotype with a K. Then there's genotype, which are the genes that you have. And then there's phenotype, spelled P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E, phenotype. And the phenotype is how the genes, which then code for RNA, which code for protein, how those are expressed in terms of things like eye color. So eye color is a phenotype. Height is a phenotype. Hair color is a phenotype. So you have karyotype, genotype, and phenotype. Well, what we need to do is we need to bring together that sperm, which is haploidd it contains those 23 chromosomal strandes-- with either an X or a Y. Sex chromosome is the 23rd chromosome. We need to get that cell to the egg. And so when we talk about spermatogenesis, of course, we are talking about the generation of sperm cells. But what we're really talking about is the generation of cells whose job is to deliver the genetic material from dad to the egg within the female in a way that increases the probability that not only will that egg be fertilized but that it will progress in a healthy way with each set of chromosomes from mom and from dad-- each set of 23 chromosomes, that is-- will progress in a healthy way, will implant in a healthy way, and will maintain and grow in a healthy way to a healthy embryo and child and eventually adult. That's the job of the sperm. So as we talk about spermatogenesis, let's just remember that and why they're there in the first place. Now, a few things about sperm that are interesting, besides the fact that they're haploid and besides the fact that, as you all know, they swim. They have a head and a tail. They actually have a head, a mid region, and a tail, and that mid region turns out to be very important. It's something we'll come back to again and again. That mid region is really key for the ability for sperm to engage in forward progression to swim forward. It involves the activity of mitochondria, which are involved in generation of ATP, which is involved in all aspects of energy and all cells. But let's just remember that the sperm are swimming cells. And in order to create a really good swimmer or set of swimmers, you need a couple of things. First of all, within the testes is where the sperm develop. And unlike in females and unlike in the ovary, there's no vault of sperm. The sperm are continually being generated. It takes about 60 days for sperm to be born from their parent cells-- because cells actually give rise to other cells, that's the it works-- to be born from their parent cells and then matured to the point where they can be a really good swimmer. Now, that doesn't mean that a bunch of sperm are made on day one, and then 60 days later, all those sperm are deployed in the form of ejaculate, and then the cycle starts over again. So it's a little different than the ovulatory menstrual cycle. Rather, at any given point in time-- like right now, if you have testes, you have some sperm in your testes that are immature and cannot swim, cannot deliver those contents to-- those genetic contents, rather-- to the female egg. And you have some sperm that are mature, and you very likely have some sperm that are so mature that they are dying off or that they're dead. Almost certainly, also, regardless of your age, you have some sperm that are healthier than others, that are better swimmers than others. This is just the way the system works. Now, the process of spermatogenesis involves a couple of things, but a lot of the players are the same as the process of developing the so-called oocyte, the immature egg. We've got GnRH from the hypothalamus. That's going to be a player. We have FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone, although the name's a little bit of a misnomer in the context of spermatogenesis, because in the context of spermatogenesis, there is no follicle. What we're really talking about is FSH for stimulating the maturation of the sperm cell, so not egg follicle but sperm cell. But we still have GnRH, FSH, LH, and rather than the ovary being the target of those hormones, it's going to be the testes. So most everybody should know that the testes and the ovaries are the so-called gonads. The testes, of course, reside outside of the body. There are instances where the testes fail to descend during development. Certainly, if the testes don't descend on time, that's something that doctors need to be made aware of, the pediatrician should be made aware of, because that can prevent fertility. Why would that be? Well, it turns out that the testes reside outside the body in the scrotum because the temperature conditions under which spermatogenesis can occur and under which healthy sperm can be maintained are very restricted and is approximately 2 degrees cooler than the rest of the body. This is very important. I think this is something that used to be discussed a lot more but isn't discussed so much these days. But keeping the testes cool enough-- doesn't necessarily mean keeping them cold, although there is a place for using cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure, to improve sperm quality and number and perhaps even testosterone levels. We'll talk about that a little bit later. But keeping the testes about 2 degrees cooler than the rest of the body is absolutely key. If sperm get too hot, they die. And if spermatocytes, the cells that give rise to sperm, get too warm, well, then oftentimes the sperm that develop are not healthy, not healthy in a number of ways. Either they can't engage in fast forward progression-- that is, swimming-- or they will lack the ability to deposit their DNA contents within the egg. So again, whatever is contained in the ejaculate is going to be a mixture of different sperm qualities. And sperm of different ages will impact the quality, but also the temperature under which those sperm developed is going to impact their quality. And so we're going to get into tools a little bit later, as I mentioned, but just to give you a simple takeaway. If you are hoping to conceive in the next 90 days-- the spermatogenesis cycle take 60 days, but then the sperm actually have to migrate from the testicle into the so-called epididymis, which is a related structure, and then into the vas deferens and then into the urethra, where it can be part of the ejaculate. In order for sperm to do all that properly, undergo that maturation and then exit in ejaculate in a way that's healthy or that the sperm is healthy, if you plan to conceive children or to try and conceive children in the next 90 days, you definitely want to avoid exposing your testicles-- that is, your scrotum-- to elevated temperatures. So that means definitely avoiding hot tubs, definitely avoiding hot baths. Now, a brief hot bath or hot tub or hot shower isn't going to be a problem, although if you're really interested in conceiving, I would avoid hot tubs and hot baths as much as possible. Hot showers are probably fine. But if you're going to go into a sauna, for instance, you might want to rethink that decision. And if you do decide to, you almost certainly would want to bring a cold pack in that you could-- well, hopefully put some material between the cold pack and the scrotum so you don't get a cold burn. But put something there, but keep the scrotal tissue cool. Keep it cold to cool because heat exposure can really mutate and disrupt the developing sperm, and it can kill sperm. And so, again, that would be for an entire 90 days leading up to your attempts to conceive. Again, we'll get into more tools later, but a number of people also have probably heard of the boxers versus briefs controversy, I guess it is, or whether or not people call it going commando with no underwear of any kind-- boxers, briefs, briefs, or otherwise rather. It turns out that the data on that point to the fact that there isn't really a big difference in terms of sperm quality if people wear boxers or briefs or don't wear anything under their jeans or shorts at all. The scrotum has the ability to move the testicles far enough away from the body in order to achieve lower temperatures if it needs to. It achieves that through a muscle called the cremaster muscle, which is a really interesting muscle, believe it or not. I was reading up on the biology of the cremaster muscle, something I never thought I'd spend too much time on but that I ended up spending far too much time reading up about. And it's really fascinating. What you have is a muscle that is a smooth muscle tissue, unlike skeletal muscle, which is striated muscle, that is temperature dependent. So it has certain nerve endings, and it has certain receptors on it that allow it to respond to local temperature and then to relax in order to essentially let the testicles to descend further from the body or to contract and bring the testicles closer to the body in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range. And it turns out the cremaster muscle can achieve that whether or not people are wearing boxers or briefs. Although it stands to reason that any kind of-- there's no other name for it-- undergarments-- you know, I don't know why that word just seems kind of antiquated-- but undergarment that allows some movement of the scrotum and the testicles should be sufficient to allow these temperature variations to occur and keep things in range. That said, a little bit later, we'll go into some detail, really-- because it's important-- as to why, for instance, if you are somebody who has big thighs, believe it or not, that it actually can lower sperm count substantially, whether or not the big thighs occur because you're very muscular or the big thighs occur because you are overweight. It can increase the temperature. If you're sitting a lot, increases scrotal temperature, for sure. And there are some other things that can increase scrotal temperature, seat heaters in cars, for instance-- terrible idea, just terrible idea if you're hoping to conceive in the near future-- and again, hot tub, things of that sort. So temperature modulation of spermatogenesis and sperm quality and function is key. That relates a little bit more to tools. But what happens? How does the actual sperm develop? Well, contained within the testicle, you have the cells, the so-called spermatogonia, which differentiate into so-called spermatocytes. You don't have to remember all this. And the spermatocytes undergo this process of meiosis. Meiosis is a form of cell division, which reduces the chromosome number to those 23 individual strands as opposed to pairs. So it makes them haploid as opposed to diploid. Very, very important for reasons that we talked about earlier. And the meiosis process in these primordial sperm cells, these immature sperm cells, is similar to the meiosis process that occurs in eggs when the chromosomes segregate in that it involves these spindle-like structures within the cell. Now, why do I keep bringing up the spindles? Well, it turns out that the function of the spindle in the egg and the sperm is heavily dependent on mitochondrial function. And later when we get into tools for improving egg and sperm quality, you're going to hear about a lot of tools for improving mitochondria. And it's not just because the mitochondria are involved in energy-demanding aspects of cell biology. But it's also because the mitochondria in this context are very, very important for the removal of or the separation of one set of chromosomes to give you these two sets of haploid cells, the egg and the sperm. And this is so important because many failures at fertilization, many failures at implantation, many, many miscarriages, and many birth defects that do survive after birth that are very detrimental, such as trisomies and things like that, occur because the spindles don't effectively pull apart the chromosomes in typically the egg, but it can also occur in the sperm. So the spindles and the fact that mitochondria are rich on the spindle are very important for generating these haploid sperm-- again, 23 individual strands of chromosomes. That's occurring inside of the testes. So there's not as much long-distance migration of the spermatocytes and the sperm cells as there is the egg just when you think about the overall architecture of the uterus and the Fallopian tubes compared to the testicles, but there's still a lot of movement. So within the testicle, if you were to look at the testicle in cross-section-- and I prefer to call it that rather than cut the testicle in half. Any time you talk about anatomy, you actually talk about slicing things. That's what you would do with a cadaver is what I teach and we do in my laboratory and, frankly, in biological laboratories all over the place. But when you talk about it, you talk about if you were to take a visual cross-section through the testicle, what you would find is that there are a lot of different little tubes, a lot of ducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts. Those are pathways. And the main ducts that are important for this discussion are called the seminiferous tubules. So it's a mesh-like or network structure of tubes in the testicle. And the immature sperm sit on a little compartment along the edge of those tubes. And as they mature, they move towards the center of those tubes. And then when they are mature enough, those sperm cells actually drop into the hollow of the tube, and then can travel through those tubes to a structure that's along the side of the testicle called the epididymis. The epididymis, again, is a series of ducts. And then the epididymis converges with something called the vas deferens. I think in high school, we all remember this by thinking about it's the vast difference. I don't know who came up with that. I think it was a young girl sitting to the left of me that was like, oh, it's like the vast difference. I never forgot that. I don't know. Maybe it was the topic matter. Maybe it was her. Maybe it was some combination of the two. But in any case, the sperm go from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis and then to the vas deferens and then are contained in the ejaculate, along with seminal fluid. Now, the seminal fluid is the carrier fluid for the sperm themselves. This is important because it turns out that a lot of things that can both negatively or positively impact the quality of the sperm relates not just to the sperm cells themselves and the temperature of the environment that they were matured in, but also to the semen quality. For instance, if you are a heavy drinker, if you are a smoker, or if you are a regular user of cannabis, especially if you smoke cannabis or vape cannabis, you create a lot of reactive oxygen species that disrupt the chemistry of the seminal fluid, which disrupts the sperm cells. So it's not a direct action always on the sperm cell itself, although it can be. So for instance, in the form of smoked tobacco or cannabis, there are a lot of carcinogens and mutagens that actually mutate the DNA, can cause DNA fragmentation, and debilitate sperm. But there are also a lot of things created by smoking in particular, regardless of what's being smoked, that can create elevated reactive oxygen species and disrupt the seminal fluid that the sperm are contained in in the so-called ejaculate, the semen. Now, this will also become a relevant conversation later when we briefly talk about vasectomies. Vasectomies are literally a cutting of the vas deferens, which leads to a situation, provided the surgery was done correctly, where men can still achieve all the other aspects of intercourse. They can still achieve erection. They can still achieve orgasm. They can still ejaculate. But when they ejaculate, the seminal fluid is released, but there are no sperm contained within the seminal fluid. And it turns out that vasectomies are a very effective form of birth control. And they always check to see if zero sperm and confirm that zero sperm are being released in the ejaculate. They are reversible. And that is, vasectomies are reversible, but not always. There are a subset of cases where it's not reversible, in which case if people still want to have children, you have to go in and actually surgically extract sperm from the testicles. But it's a process in which the vas deferens is altered or severed in a way that the sperm can't actually exit the testicle. They can get into the epididymis, usually, but not into the vas deferens and so on and so forth. So if you've ever wondered what a vasectomy is, that's what a vasectomy is. And I mentioned vasectomy now because it illustrates the difference between the seminal fluid, the semen, and the sperm that the semen contain. So 60 days to generate the sperm, another two weeks or so for the sperm to travel through the various ducts to the point where they can be contained in the ejaculate. Let's talk about the sperm cells themselves. The sperm cells, again, have these 23 pairs of single-strand chromosomes. They're haploid. They have either an X or a Y sex chromosome as the 23rd so-called sex chromosome. And as we all know, they have a head. The head tends to be oval in most cases. The head contains very important enzymes and proteins that are designed to fuse with the much larger egg and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell and combine to actually mesh with the egg cell's membrane and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell, in other words, to fertilize the egg cell. Now, just behind the head is a region called the mid region. That mid region is a slightly thickened region. And here, of course, I'm talking about healthy sperm cell morphology. Morphology simply means shape. A mid region-- that mid region has a bunch of things related to cell motility and to the forward progression of the cells. First of all, it is chock a block full of mitochondria. In fact, if you were to look just behind the head of the sperm, what you'd see is that it is completely surrounded by mitochondria. There are mitochondria elsewhere in the cell, but most of them are contained in this mid region compartment just behind the head of the sperm. And that thick region is where the tail movement of the sperm, the flagellation back and forth, is actually generated from. Much like if you were to hold a rope, like a battle rope in the gym, and you were to whip the battle rope, the whip at the one end of the rope is what allows for the sort of-- let's just call it what it is-- the curves in the rope, the oscillations, the rising and falling of the rope all the way out to the end. It is the force of the whip right at that end that with the battle rope you're doing with your hand-- and with the sperm, that is occurring just behind the head of the sperm-- that is actually going to dictate how fast and how well that sperm can swim. And indeed, the sperm has to swim very far. How far? Well, on a relative scale-- and again, these are estimations because they're going to be-- how should we say? There will be differences in the distance from the head of the penis and where the ejaculation occurs to the cervix, depending on the relative size of the vaginal canal and the penis that delivers the ejaculate to the vaginal canal. But once the sperm arrive at the cervix, which is at the back of the vaginal canal just at the opening to the uterus, once the sperm arrive there, the distance from the cervix to the egg, of course, will vary depending on where that egg is in its ovulatory trajectory, its pathway. But it is akin, if you scale for size, to the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco, which is many, many hundreds of miles. So those sperm have to swim very far. Now, of course, if the sperm are delivered in the vaginal canal somewhat further away, they will have further to go. If they're delivered right at the cervical opening, they will have less far to go. The very effective swimming sperm swim very fast. So they are able to accomplish that distance in just a few days. And this relates to a discussion that we will get into in a lot more detail later as to how often couples should have intercourse if they're trying to conceive. Many people might think, well, it's every day. However, the more frequent the ejaculation, the lower the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate. So this is not a discussion about how often to have intercourse depending to your preferences, for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason. This is a discussion about how often to have intercourse in order to optimize the probability of fertilization of the egg. There's some general rules that, of course, come to mind, which is ejaculations close to ovulation-- both before, during, or sometimes after-- are obviously advantageous. But you will also hear OB/GYNs and urologist suggesting intercourse every other day leading up to the day of ovulation, starting about three to four days out from the day of ovulation. So we got a little bit sidetracked, albeit I think appropriately so, in focusing on fertilization. But what we were talking about right up until the point of that is the anatomy of the sperm itself, which is the head, the mid region that contains all those mitochondria, and then the tail. Now, what we haven't discussed is the actual generation of the sperm. So if you're a male or if you're a female, I think it's really important to understand how spermatogenesis works. Spermatogenesis works in much in the same way that the generation and maturation of eggs work, although, as I mentioned before, it's going to occur ongoing throughout the cycle of the male's life after puberty. We already talked about puberty, and I'll just cover this in two or three sentences as it relates to males. And it's essentially the same thing. The hypothalamus, up until the point of puberty, is providing suppression of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Then some biological clock, which is still not clearly understood-- it's probably not leptin coming from body fat. Again, unlike in the female, it's probably not leptin coming from body fat. But some other signal arrives to the hypothalamus, removes that inhibition, and GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is now released onto the pituitary. A bunch of hormones are deployed from the pituitary as a consequence. The two most important ones for the context of this discussion are follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone travel to the testes, and they're going to do two main things. One, they're going to trigger the production of testosterone. And they're going to trigger the production of the sperm themselves. They're going to set in motion, for essentially the rest of the life of the male, the production of sperm. They're going to initiate the spermatogenesis cycle, and that cycle is going to be ongoing at various stages for different sperm for the rest of the man's life. This is very different than the triggering of development of oocytes and eggs in females, where there's an existing vault. That vault can be depleted to the point of zero where it can't occur again. Men can generate sperm their entire lifetime. Of course, there's a diminishment of sperm production in very, very late age, say, 80s and 90s or 100s. But believe it or not, there are still sperm being produced. The quality of those sperm is another question. So everything we're going to talk about now is essentially puberty onward. Prior to that, testicles are present, but they're not generating sperm. Ejaculation isn't possible, or if it is possible, it's very unlikely and unusual, and it's not going to contain sperm. Everything we're going to talk about now is puberty forward, so puberty onward to the rest of life. And luteinizing hormone secreted from the pituitary acts on the testes and on a very specific cell type in the testes called the Leydig egg cells, or Leydig cells, L-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells. The Leydig cells of the testes are what produce testosterone. Testosterone is going to have two major effects. And here I mean really major because it has many, many hundreds of effects on different tissues of the body. In fact, that's the definition of a hormone, really. It's a substance that acts in an endocrine fashion. It can act on the very tissue that generated it. So for instance, testosterone made by the Leydig cells within the testes will act on the testes, as we'll talk about in a moment. But it can also act on other tissues. It can act on the pharynx and larynx and deepen the voice, as it does during puberty. It can act on the hair follicles and generate facial hair. It can act on the musculature and generate protein synthesis and development of muscle, bone, et cetera, all the things we associate with puberty and with testosterone typically. Restricting the conversation to the effects of testosterone on the testicle itself and on spermatogenesis, the Leydig cells make testosterone. And keep in mind that some of that testosterone will travel elsewhere in the body and do its thing for gene expression and the more acute effects of testosterone on the brain included. But the testosterone within the testes is at extremely high concentration. In fact, the concentration of intratesticular testosterone is at least 100 times higher than the concentration of testosterone anywhere else in the body, even though it's being secreted into the rest of the body. And that's because there are a number of different so-called binding proteins and enzymes that sequester the testosterone within the testes. So the Leydig cells are making testosterone, and a lot of that testosterone is acting on and is restricted to the testes. And that turns out to be very important because testosterone within the testes acts in concert with a different biological program that starts with FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone, that also travels to the testes and acts on a very specific set of cells that are called supporting cells or, more specifically, the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the cells that generate something called ABP, or androgen-binding protein. And it is the combination of testosterone from the Leydig cells and ABP from the Sertoli cells that is necessary for spermatogenesis. It's necessary for those spermatocytes to become what will eventually be healthy, mature sperm that have really nice shaped oval heads, have a mid region, chock a block through mitochondria, and can generate a fast whipping motion of the tail to swim from the cervix, or up the vagina into the cervix, and from the cervix to the egg to fertilize the egg. So it's really a basic set of chemical players that are involved here and so basic, in fact, that if you were to disrupt any one of these chemical players-- either the luteinizing hormone, the FSH, the testosterone from the Leydig cells, or androgen-binding protein-- you would observe pretty marked disruption in spermatogenesis or the elimination of sperm entirely. We'll get into a few deficits in sperm development and sperm number and sperm function a little bit later. But just keep in mind-- or I should say, maybe sit back and just appreciate that the exact same players generate from the hypothalamus, which causes luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone released from the pituitary, which travels to the gonad, which in this case is the testicle, which triggers the release of testosterone from Leydig cells, which triggers the action of the supporting cells, the Sertoli cells, which make androgen-binding protein. Testosterone and androgen-binding protein combine and create a chemical and actually a structural milieu in which those little spermatocytes can go from the walls, from literally the walls of the tubes of the seminiferous tubules, can mature into healthy, well-developed sperm, and can hop into those ducts, those little tubes, and then head off to the epididymis, where they will reside-- the epididymis is the tissue nearby the testicles or surrounding one portion of the testicle-- and then eventually fuse with the vas deferens, can combine with or be contained with, rather, the seminal fluid, and then can be ejaculated via the urethra into the female, where then they can swim very quickly, effectively the distance, for them anyway, from Los Angeles to San Francisco, over the course of a very short period of time, and fertilize the egg. So that's the process of spermatogenesis, the maturation of sperm, which is ongoing throughout the lifespan from puberty onward. And in doing so, we talked about some of the hormonal elements-- coming from the hypothalamus and coming from the pituitary, and within the testes themselves the Leydig cells, which produce testosterone, the Sertoli cells, which are the support cells that allow spermatogenesis to occur. With that in mind, next I'd like to think about what's actually contained in the ejaculate in terms of numbers of sperm and what's really being selected for in terms of the sperm that actually successfully fertilizes the egg and what sorts of elements come into play in dictating whether or not fertilization will or won't occur. And the major themes that we're going to discuss are frequency of ejaculation, but really that's just kind of a proxy for talking about maximizing sperm concentration and quality of sperm arriving at the egg-- because, remember, ovulation and the menstrual cycle are really about creating the opportunity for fertilization. And we are also going to talk about how the vaginal duct, the vagina, and the milieu around the cervix and some other elements within the female herself contribute to and support the sperm in their journey to the egg and in the likelihood that they will fertilize the egg. So really what we need to talk about first is sperm quality. And we should also probably talk about ejaculate quality, because, as odd as that theme might seem, really the ejaculate quality, which has a number of different parameters, including the number of mature sperm that are not so mature that they're swimming slower or are dead, but also quality of sperm. They have, for instance, one tail. It's not entirely uncommon to see sperm with two tails because they just didn't form properly or sperm that are not moving very much. In fact, sperm motility is scored along a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best, fast forward progressing. 0 is not moving at all. 1, they're actually called twitchers. Twitchers are sperm that sort of just twitch in place but don't undergo forward progression. 2 is somewhere in between 1 and 3, not surprisingly. Different clinics, different OB/GYNs, different urologists will throw out different numbers. But in general, it is hoped that more than 50% of the sperm should be motile in some way or another, so not scoring a 0, but a 1, or 2, or ideally a 3. The concentration of sperm-- of course, if it's higher within the ejaculate, the total number of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate, if that's higher, then there's a higher probability that one of those sperm will fertilize the egg. One thing I didn't mention before when discussing the production of eggs and ovulation-- and I probably should have, so I will now-- is that most often only one ovary gives rise to an ovulating egg. It happens, but it's somewhat rare for two mature eggs, one from each ovary, to be deployed during a single ovulation. There's a name for that when it occurs and both are fertilized. It's called fraternal twins. If a single egg-- that, of course, comes from a single ovary-- is fertilized and the egg splits-- and that's something that happens further along in the process of fertilization and differentiation of the embryo-- well, then what you get are identical twins. There are other instances that are quite uncommon in which you can get fraternal twins through other circumstances. But in general, that's the way it works. But essentially what happens is one egg from one ovary-- that's the most common occurrence. The sperm, once ejaculated into the vaginal duct, are going to pass through the cervix and then are going to swim toward the egg. The egg could be at varying locations along the female reproductive axis. Now, this is actually a very important thing and actually gets right down to the safety of both the potentially developing embryo and the mother. There is something referred to as ectopic pregnancy, and that's when the pregnancy actually occurs within the Fallopian tubes. So the precise location in which fertilization between the sperm and the egg occurs can vary somewhat. But ideally, the fertilized egg implants into the endometrium or the endometrial lining of the uterus and develops there as opposed to within the Fallopian tubes, which is so-called ectopic pregnancy. Now, where the sperm and the egg meet exactly can vary, as I mentioned before. But in general, the faster swimming sperm and the more far along the ovulatory trajectory the egg are, the higher the probability of a successful fertilization because of the proximity to the implantation zone of the uterus. So basically it's all a probabilities game. It's a probabilities game related to the number of sperm cells that encounter the egg and where the egg is in terms of its ovulatory cycle and also its position where it is in the ovulatory cycle. The sperm parameters-- or I should say the semen parameters-- and ejaculate parameters that most clinicians want to see, if you were to give a sperm sample, would be somewhere in excess of 15 million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate. Now, there's a lot of discussion nowadays. It seems to be a very popular news theme to talk about diminishing sperm counts, the idea that 100 years ago or maybe even 35 years ago, the typical male ejaculate contained 100 million sperm per milliliter, and nowadays it's down to 15 to 20 or 50. And indeed, sperm counts do seem to be declining. And the exact reasons for that are not clear. I confess I'm a little bit reluctant to talk about this because there have been a lot of back and forth discussions about the safety of EMFs, of electromagnetic fields, and it's not exactly what we're talking about here. But there are some excellent data contained in meta-analyses and reviews that I will provide links to and that we'll talk about in more detail in a minute that correlate the advent of smartphones and in particular caring of smartphones in the pocket with diminishing sperm counts. Although there are certain to be other factors that can explain diminishing sperm counts as well. Dr. Shanna Swan, for instance, has done beautiful work describing how the phthalates and the BPAs and so-called endocrine disruptors might be disrupting some of the milieu of the seminiferous tubules. So this would be reductions in testosterone and/or disruptions to the Sertoli cells and androgen-binding protein brought about by endocrine disruptors such as phthalates contained in pesticides and contained on printed receipts and things of that sort. There are some data that that is negatively impacting sperm counts. How much so is still debatable. There are also quite good data pointing to the fact that both the heat-related and the non-heat-related impact of smartphones and laptops contained on the lap are impacting sperm count and in a negative way. Again, there's going to be tremendous variation in the concentration of sperm from one individual to the next. It will vary according to age and a number of other factors that we'll talk about a little bit later. But in general, if somebody is wishing to conceive, then clinicians like to see a ejaculate volume of more than 2 milliliters. So ejaculate volume can be anywhere from 1.5 to 5 milliliters. And that will strongly be determined by how frequent ejaculation is occurring. There's a lot that goes into evaluating the quality of ejaculate and sperm. But basically these huge variations that are observed of anywhere from 15 million sperm per milliliter or, in some males who are not producing sperm for whatever reason-- we'll talk about those reasons in a little bit-- as low as 5 million sperm per milliliter, all the way up to 100 or maybe even 200 million sperm per milliliter. Huge variation-- the cause of which is not always clear but is certainly determined in part by the frequency of ejaculation. So because there are so many variables impacting why one male versus another male or even the same male across the lifespan might have variations in his concentration of sperm within the ejaculate, let's talk for a second about frequency of ejaculation as it relates to the goal of fertility, per se, because that's really what today's episode is all about. So what I'd like to talk about next is how people can increase the probability of a successful fertilization, focusing both on the components from the male side and from the female side. And I'm mainly going to couch this discussion in the context of the so-called natural method of sexual intercourse and ejaculation in vivo, within the female. But I will also touch on some parallel themes as it relates to in-vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination. So the idea here is that we want the maximum number of high-quality sperm-- that is, rapidly forward, motile sperm that are of the correct morphology-- that is, shape. That's going to require a lot of mitochondria in the mid region, a well-shaped head-- so it's going to be an oval-shaped head. The tail is going to be a single tail, not multiple tails. These aren't going to be the twitcher type of-- or immotile type of sperm that are either twitching in place or aren't moving forward. All of those components are going to be essential for increasing the probability of fertilization. But of course, there's the female side of it, too, which is that ovulation occurs on just one day during the menstrual ovulatory cycle. And that egg will be available for fertilization for approximately 24 hours. Now, keep in mind that the sperm can survive within the vaginal duct and within the area around the cervix and within the uterus and along the female reproductive tract for anywhere from three to five or it's even been described as up to seven days. But generally, it's going to be about three to five days. Now, most women can figure out the day of their ovulation by counting the total number of days of their typical cycle. And this is where it's really useful to have a cycle that's of more or less regular duration or, rather, of more or less regular length. So as we talked about earlier, if somebody's cycle is 21 days or 25 days and it's 21 or 25 days consistently or even 30 days consistently, that's going to be a far better scenario to favor fertilization than if it's 20 days one month and then 21 days the next month, but then suddenly 30 days and then suddenly 35 days. Those varying durations of the ovulatory cycle make it very hard, obviously, to time and understand when ovulation is going to occur. So regular duration ovulatory cycles are the ideal circumstance, and they're the ideal circumstance, because even though the egg is only available for fertilization for a few days, those sperm can survive for some period of time, which leads to the issue of how often should couples be having intercourse. And here, I'm referring specifically to intercourse with ejaculation. How often should couples be having intercourse around the time of ovulation if the specific goal is successful fertilization of the egg and the creation of a baby? This is leaving aside all issues, which, of course, are interesting issues, related to how often people are having intercourse, whether or not there's ejaculation every time they have intercourse or not, for sake of pleasure or for sake of pair bonding and pleasure or for sake of any number of other potential goals of intercourse. Here I'm only referring to intercourse as it relates to the goal of fertilization of the egg. So knowing what we know about spermatogenesis and the fact that ejaculate is going to contain a certain concentration of sperm but that within that ejaculate some of the sperm will be older and less healthy and some will be optimally mature and some might even be a little bit immature-- although there's a tendency for the immature sperm to not have yet exited the seminiferous tubules, gone into the epididymis and vas deferens. But given that the ejaculate contains sperm of varying ages and therefore varying quality and given that with each successive ejaculation in a short period of time there's going to be a decrease in the concentration of sperm per milliliter of semen, of ejaculate, we can make some good arguments as to how often couples should have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation if the goal is to fertilize. If ovulation occurs on, for instance, day 14 of a cycle-- and here we're using the kind of standard average of 28 days of the cycle. But for some people with a 30-day cycle, it could be day 15, or with a shorter cycle, it could be day 12, for instance. But given a 28-day average cycle, let's say ovulation occurs on day 13 or on day 14. And typically, it would occur on day 14 of a 28-day cycle. Well, then, given how long sperm can survive inside of the woman, you might think that the optimal strategy would be to have as much intercourse with ejaculation in the three or four days leading up to ovulation, hope that those sperm have swam as far as they possibly can and will encounter the egg just as soon as possible after it ovulates. It turns out that's not the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy is really to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate and to really center that around the day of ovulation. So what this involves generally and what the typical recommendation is is to abstain from intercourse with ejaculation about two or three days out from ovulation and then, on the day prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation, to essentially introduce as much semen and ejaculate into the reproductive pathway of the female as possible. Now, that's the general recommendation that the OB/GYNs and the urologists that I spoke to gave. But you will also hear a different strategy. It's only slightly different. But the different strategy involves trying to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate with the understanding that, with each subsequent ejaculation over about a 24-hour period, that there's going to be a dramatic reduction in the concentration of sperm. What that means is that if a couple, for instance, were to have intercourse with ejaculation many times on the day prior to ovulation, yes, that will introduce a lot of sperm into the reproductive pathway of the female, but what it means is that, on the day of ovulation if they were to have intercourse, the number of high quality sperm that will be available to the egg will be greatly diminished. And if none of the sperm that were introduced in the day prior managed to fertilize that egg, well, then essentially chances are off that there will be fertilization or they're greatly diminished. Rather, if they're having intercourse with ejaculation once or twice on the day prior to ovulation and then a maximal number of times with ejaculation on the day of ovulation, that itself can maximize the probability of fertilization. So which strategy is optimal? Should couples have as much intercourse with ejaculation on the day prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation? Or should they have intercourse on the day prior to ovulation but not so frequently that it diminishes the concentration of sperm and then allows for intercourse with the maximum number of ejaculations on the day of ovulation? You really hear it both ways. And what this really boils down to is, frankly, that nobody knows. And the reason nobody knows is that there's tremendous variation among males in terms of the absolute concentration of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate and the amount of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate within a given time frame. But what everyone agrees on is that a period of abstinence ranging from 48 to 72 hours prior to an ejaculation increases the concentration of high-quality sperm within that first ejaculation to occur after the abstinence period. So again, to reiterate, if one's goal is to fertilize the egg, you want to take into consideration that most often there is going to be a dramatic decline in the concentration of sperm per ejaculate any time those ejaculations are occurring within a short period of time, say, within 12 to 24 hours of one another. Now, all of this, of course, also relates to the female biology and the extent to which the woman can precisely identify the day and timing of her ovulation. Some women feel as if and indeed are very accurate at estimating their time of ovulation to within a couple of hours or some women even report being able to feel their actual ovulation, whether or not they are feeling the ovulation itself, the deployment of the egg or not, isn't clear. I certainly wouldn't know. I've never produced eggs, nor have I ovulated, and I'm certainly not going to contest the idea that women can do that. I mean, it makes sense that some people have a very keen so-called interoceptive awareness, an awareness of the sensory events within their body. And while, of course, the ovaries are not thought of as an organ that we want to be able to sense what's going on in there in terms of feel, there are sensory endings within the ovary. And so the notion that one could literally sense changes within their ovary, including the deployment of the egg, is not outside the bounds of reason and, in fact, could likely be the case. Now, that said, there are a number of different ways that women will track their ovulation. One is the temperature method. So they'll actually measure intravaginal temperature. They're looking for changes in temperature that are consistent around the time of ovulation. We're going to have an expert guest on, an OB/GYN, who can tell us a lot more about the details and nuances of the temperature method. You'll see a lot of information about this online, but there's a lot of misunderstanding about it, as well. Other women will use apps that take into account either the temperature information if they're acquiring temperature information-- that'll be entered into the app-- as well as marking the onset of menstruation, the onset of bleeding, therefore, the start of the ovulatory cycle, because, of course, as we mentioned earlier, that marks day one of their cycle. And then, again and again, you can see how regularity of cycle duration or relative regularity of cycle duration really favors this whole process of being able to predict when one ovulates. And fortunately, if the goal is fertilization, there are some margins for error that are introduced by the fact that the sperm can survive within the female reproductive tract for some period of days, thereby reducing the need for absolute certainty about the time of ovulation and so on. In fact, it's pretty well known that around the time of ovulation a couple of things happen. Earlier, we talked about one thing, which is there's an increase in libido just prior to ovulation. This relates to, in part, an increase in some of the androgens, things like DHEA, but also testosterone and some related androgens that can increase libido both in males and females and changes to the reproductive pathway, the female in particular, a change in the pH-- that is, the relative acidity versus basic nature of the mucosal lining near the cervix and also vaginal secretions, such that, around the time of ovulation, the entire milieu of the vagina and the cervix and the locations in which fertilization can occur and certainly in which the sperm are swimming towards the opportunity for fertilization is shifted to support sperm motility and health. In other words, one of the best environments for sperm to survive is going to be within the female reproductive pathway itself. And as long as we're talking about vaginal secretions and mucus, it's important to point out that a number of commercially available lubricants can actually be detrimental for sperm health, even if they don't contain spermicide. So this is something that you'll want to discuss with your OB/GYN or, certainly if you're male, you could also discuss this with your urologist and your partner's OB/GYN. A lot of the commercially available lubricants contain chemicals that, while they may favorably change the consistency or the viscosity of the vaginal pathway for purposes of intercourse, certainly may not be the most favorable for maintaining the health of the sperm and the motility of the sperm. So again, here we're talking about intercourse only in the context of trying to maximize fertilization. And I should mention that there are certain lubricants that are more conducive to the sperm environment. But it's something that you'll really want to talk to your OB/GYN about or at least read up about if your interest is in trying to fertilize and develop an embryo. So we covered the optimal strategies for how often couples should have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation in order to maximize the probability that successful fertilization and ultimately pregnancy will occur. What we haven't covered yet, however, is how long couples should apply that method over time in order to achieve successful fertilization in pregnancy. Now, of course, if a couple decides that they want to conceive and they apply that method or any other method, for instance, and they achieve fertilization and a successful pregnancy the very first month that they try, well, then there's no other work to do, at least until that child is born and if and only if they decide they want to have more children. However, many couples find that they do not conceive in the first month of trying, even when they apply the optimal methods and even if their age and every other factor related to egg quality and sperm quality is optimized. Now, I think it's the rare instance in which egg quality and sperm quality are optimized. In fact, the word "optimal" and "optimization" and "optimized" is a little bit misleading in general because no one really knows what that is. But of course, there is an ideal. There's a perfect standard to which everyone would like to achieve. But of course, we all enter the picture with genetic variables, environmental variables, and so forth, many of which we'll talk about because you can, in fact, adjust them in the direction that you would like to improve sperm and egg quality. But most people simply will not succeed in achieving a successful fertilization the first month that they try. Now, there is a truth that governs how many tries it ought to take in order to achieve successful fertilization and ultimately pregnancy. And it's very age dependent. And in particular, it's dependent on the age of the mother, because the age and quality of the egg, while it's not the only factor, is certainly one of the most determining factors in whether or not successful fertilization occurs. And as women age, the quality of the eggs tends to diminish over time, largely due to changes in the mitochondrial function and the spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart, although there could be other factors involved as well. Now, before continuing any further, I just want to acknowledge that this whole language around egg quality and sperm quality is not the greatest language because it's entirely subjective. And yet the word "quality" in these instances is really there to explain a broad variety of factors that can, in fact, be measured, things like the number of follicles that are deployed each month in a woman's ovulation or the number of motile sperm or the number of morphologically-- that is, correctly shaped sperm in the male and so forth. So when we talk about egg quality or sperm quality, we're really referring to an amalgam of different features related to the different aspects of ovulation leading to successful fertilization or the different aspects of sperm related to whether or not they can arrive and deliver their DNA contents and so forth. So I will use the words "egg quality" and "sperm quality" just as general themes because that's what a lot of the clinicians use. But I do understand that it's a little bit of a loaded term in both instances, and it doesn't relate to any one specific parameter, per se. So getting back to this issue of how long couples should try according to the age of the female and perhaps also the age of the male. Well, most of the data that have been collected relate to the age of the female, as I mentioned before. And what we're about to discuss is, within the scientific literature, described as what's called fecundability, which is the amount of time over which a given couple needs to attempt to conceive-- of course, by having intercourse with ejaculation-- around the time of ovulation. It assumes that all the other things are being done correctly. And what we know is that there's a strong age-dependent effect that largely rests on the age of the egg-- that is, of the female. And what we know is that for females 30 years old or younger, if they have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation, say, on the day before and on the day of ovulation-- and there could be other intercourse with ejaculation around that time as well-- on average, that will result in a successful fertilization in pregnancy about 20% of the time on the first month of attempting, the first ovulation cycle. Now, if fertilization and pregnancy occurs, great. There'll be at least a nine-month lag until they decide whether or not they want to try and conceive again. However, most couples, even if the woman is 30 years old or younger, will not successfully conceive on that first attempt. And that's because the probability is not 100%. It's 20%. So 80% of the time, they simply will not conceive, which means that they hopefully will try again the very next month. And if they successfully conceive, great. And if they don't, then they ought to try again the next month, the next month, and so forth. Now, the typical advice that an OB/GYN would give you is that, for a woman 30 years or younger-- and leaving aside the age of the father but still assuming that egg quality and sperm quality are sufficiently high to achieve fertilization-- that the couple should-- or if the woman is trying to have kids alone, the woman should attempt to conceive over the period of six months. Why? Well, if you think about it, if there's a 20% chance in the first month and it's unsuccessful, well, then on the second month, there'll also be a 20% chance. On the third month, also a 20% chance. What I'm describing here is what obviously is independent probabilities. That is, if you were to flip a coin and the probability of getting heads is 50%, the probability of getting tails is 50%, of course. You don't expect that the previous flip had anything to do with the result that you'll get on the subsequent flip. That's what independent probabilities are. However, when it comes to fecundability, we're really talking about something which is called cumulative pregnancy rate, which is not really independent probabilities. Now, why would that be? Why would it be that if you did not successfully conceive in the first month of trying that, by simply trying again and again and again, the probability of conceiving would increase? Well, the reason for that is that this whole business of fertilization is not just about what's happening with the egg. It's also about what's happening with the sperm. So there are a number of different events related to the biology of the egg and the biology of the sperm, which you are now very familiar with from everything I've talked about up until now. And there a bunch of chance events, for instance, that the sperm won't actually arrive at the egg in time or that the egg won't arrive at the sperm in time, because, of course, it's a bidirectional migration of those two cell types, or that, for whatever reason, fertilization won't occur. So what we're really talking about when we talk about the cumulative pregnancy rate over time is the fact that there are multiple probabilities at work. And yes, those are somewhat independent in the sense that the biology of the sperm doesn't really strictly depend on the biology of the egg, at least not until they meet and fertilize. But the likelihood of pregnancy depends on those independent probabilities, which makes this a cumulative pregnancy rate. Now, if any of that is confusing, what it basically means is that for the egg and the sperm to meet and to fertilize, a number of different events that carry some intentionality-- the sperm swims towards the egg and so forth. The egg doesn't have a personality in there, at least not yet. But it, quote, unquote, "wants" to be fertilize. It is, in principle, receptive to fertilization. Well, in order for that to happen, there are going to be some events related to chance that could limit the ability for that to happen, and there'll be other events dictated by the biology of those two cell types that are driving that event to happen, that are biasing the event to, yes, happen. And so what we're talking about when we talk about cumulative pregnancy rate is how much of the biology of the woman is skewed towards fertilization to be likely to occur. So to make this very simple, all we need to know is that for women 30 years old or younger, because the probability of getting pregnant on any one attempt to conceive is 20%, well, then if that doesn't occur the first time, then she should simply repeat that at least five and probably six times before deciding to go to an OB/GYN and conclude that there's something going on either with the egg or, of course, it could be with the sperm because 20 times 5 is 100. So we're talking about cumulative percent-- so 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. And the six month there would take you to 120%, which is a different thing altogether. But in general, that's why OB/GYNs will tell their female patients, look, if you're setting out to conceive, try for about five or six months, and if you're not successful, come back and see me. Now, for women who are age 31 to 33, the probability of conceiving in that first month drops to about 18%. So women in that age range and their partners should certainly try and conceive naturally over a period of six or seven months in order to get to that 100% cumulative probability. And then for women who are age 34 to 37, the probability of conceiving in that first month of trying and certainly every month thereafter is about 11%. So when the age of the woman starts extending out to about 34 or 35 years old, then the typical advice of the OB/GYN is going to be to attempt to conceive over a period of about nine months to a year before deciding to take some sort of medical intervention. And then, of course, as the age of the woman increases, so too does the quality of the eggs go down. Now, that's not true for every woman. There are many women who, in their late 30s and 40s and even early 50s, have successfully conceived healthy children, although the probability of that-- the likelihood of it drops substantially. So for instance, for women who are age 38 to 39, the probability of a successful conception by natural conception-- intercourse with ejaculation-- is going to be about 5%. So it's really dropped to a quarter of what it was when that woman was 30. Again, these are averages only. What does that mean? Well, it means that if you are age 38 or older, chances are that you should probably go to your OB/GYN right at the outset of your desire to conceive and ask what you can do to improve egg quality. Otherwise, if you were to extend the math out, we know that if you're age 30 or younger, 20% chance in any one given month. That means about four to six months of trying. Well, you can simply multiply that times four or five for someone in their late 30s or early 40s. And so what you're really talking about is several years of trying. And of course, what's happening during those several years? The woman is getting older. And as a consequence, the quality of the eggs is declining even further. So if you are 35, 36 years old, it might not be entirely unreasonable to talk to your OB/GYN right at the outset of desiring to conceive, but you could also just take the approach of trying to conceive naturally for about a year or a year and a half before deciding to do that, keeping in mind that all the while you can't stop time. So biological time and aging is going to occur in the backdrop. But hopefully this description of cumulative pregnancy rate makes sense. Again, the idea is that while it's true that every single month there's an independent chance of the woman getting pregnant and that chance is dropping from abut 20% at age 30 over time to about, really, 1% to 3% for women 40 or older, there's also this notion of cumulative probability, which involves multiple biological events in both the egg and the sperm that have to converge in time and space in order for successful fertilization to occur. As long as we're on this topic, I think it's only fair to address the issue of miscarriage. And miscarriages can arise from a variety of sources. They can arise from genetic defects. They can arise from issues in the milieu view of the uterus. They can arise from issues with the sperm, for that matter. We really don't want to put all the weight and all the responsibility on the egg. This is always an egg/sperm dynamic. And when I say egg/sperm dynamic, now hopefully that calls to mind the huge library of information that we've been covering up until now about chromosomal segregation and the coming together of these different cell types and their genetic information. Any number of different steps within the process of fertilization leading up to pregnancy can lead to miscarriage. However, the probability of miscarriage greatly increases as a function of the age of the egg. And the basic numbers on thisare are that for women who are 35 years or older, about 25% of successful fertilizations lead to miscarriages. Now, when those miscarriages occur during pregnancy can be highly variable. Sometimes it's within the first trimester. Sometimes it could be later. But the probability is about 25%. That probability increases greatly over time, such that by the time women are in their early 40s-- so 40 or older-- the probability of miscarriage after a successful fertilization is going to be about 50%. And this could be due to a number of factors, as I mentioned before. But one common reason is that there can be chromosomal abnormalities. And that could be related typically to the segregation of the egg when half of the chromosomes in that egg are removed, taking it from diploid to haploid. If you recall, there's that little polar body, which is the removal of the chromosomes that's ejected from the egg that will eventually ovulate. And sometimes not all the chromosomes that were supposed to be ejected in that polar body are ejected. And as a consequence, there are multiple chromosomes or duplications of chromosomes, things like trisomies. Sometimes too many chromosomes move away and there are actually removal of entire chromosomes, meaning both strands, so that you have chromosomal deletions. And in that case, typically fertilization won't occur. But there are instances in which fertilization will occur. So a woman will get a positive pregnancy test. Her periods will stop. And the couple will think that they're advancing along the steps to a successful pregnancy, and then there will be, sadly, a miscarriage. Many, many times those miscarriages are the consequence of the fact that, when there are extra chromosomes there or there are too few chromosomes present, that embryogenesis can simply not progress in a healthy way. There are some instances in which all of the chromosomes and all the chromosomal arrangements are perfectly normal and miscarriages can still occur. I'm going to do a future episode about pregnancy and embryonic development where we will get into this more deeply. But just understand that the frequency of miscarriages increases dramatically after about age 34 and then continues to increase dramatically, extending well out until the 40s. Now, a very important consideration in terms of understanding and predicting fertility and fecundability, this word that describes the probability of getting pregnant on a given try and over time, is trying to address how, quote, unquote, "fertile" a woman is and, importantly, how, quote, unquote, "fertile" a male is. And we'll talk about the male side in a moment. But when trying to address how fertile a woman is, of course, age is going to be one of the major factors, but just one factor. We already talked about how age determines the likelihood of a successful pregnancy if the intercourse and ejaculation is being carried out at the correct times and with viable sperm capable of fertilizing eggs. And then, of course, there's the issue of egg quality. But in general, most women would like to know how fertile they are as a function of their age. And I actually think this is one of the most important topics in this whole space around fertility that isn't often discussed or at least isn't often discussed until women are in their late 30s or 40s, when oftentimes they will look back and wish that either they had frozen their eggs or they had frozen fertilized embryos, which is a whole thing unto itself. And we can talk about that when we have an episode on in-vitro fertilization in more depth. But there is a fairly straightforward way or set of ways that women can determine their basic level of fertility. Leaving aside a lot of the detailed issues about the quality of eggs and so forth, one thing that you already learned is that there's this vault, there's this reserve that we call the ovarian reserve, and that each month a certain number of follicles leave that reserve, and there's the opportunity, based on the ovulation of a single egg, to fertilize that egg and for the woman to get pregnant. Now, one thing that we know for sure is that the size of the population that's released from that vault each month has a very strong positive correlation with the size of the reserve in the vault itself. So the way to think about this, perhaps, is that the vault is like a bank account. It has a certain amount of money-- in this case, eggs-- in it. And you could imagine, if someone's reasonably logical, that if they have more money in their bank account, then they're going to withdraw a larger amount each month than if they have a small amount each month, if the idea is to make that vault, that bank, of eggs available to them over the longest period of time. And indeed, biology is pretty smart. It doesn't deploy or release half the follicles in one month and then just slowly trickle out the remainder of follicles. No, that's not how it works. What you find is that, of course, in younger women-- so, say, in their late teens, 20s, and 30s-- the ovarian reserve in the vault is going to have more eggs in it, and the number of follicles and eggs that leave that vault each month is going to be quite high. So one way to evaluate how, quote, unquote, "fertile" you are-- again, just one way-- is to go to your OB/GYN and say that you would like to know how many follicles you have in a given month. And of course, they'll look at them on both sides, in both ovaries. And for instance, if a woman has just two or three follicles that are out each month, well, then the assumption-- again, it's just an assumption-- but the assumption that's pretty good-- because there is this positive correlation that generally occurs-- is that that ovarian reserve-- that the number of eggs in the vault is fairly low compared to someone who, say, has 20 follicles or 30 follicles each month. And that's the typical trend. Again, these are averages. And it's very important to not get attached to any one number here. Again, these are averages. So for instance, there are women who only deploy five follicles and eggs each month out of their ovarian vault but who find themselves to be very fertile. And there could be a number of different factors to explain that. Other women will have 20 or 30 eggs and follicles that leave that vault, the ovarian reserve, each month. And they will have a harder time getting pregnant for any number of different reasons. But in general, the more eggs and follicles that leave the vault each month, the higher number of eggs that are still in reserve, meaning the greater amount of time over which a given woman could still attempt to have successful fertilizations. Now, this small collection of follicles and eggs that are released each month actually has a name. They're called antral follicles. These are small follicles. They tend to be about 2 to 9 millimeters across. The way these are analyzed or measured is woman will go into the OB/GYN office, and by ultrasound-- typically there's some local anesthesia, but it's not often a general anesthesia, but by local anesthesia or sometimes no anesthesia-- they will essentially count the number of follicles that are present in each side, on ovary on the left and the ovary on the right, and give a woman some sense of how many follicles she has. And typically this is done over a series of months to determine how many eggs are leaving the ovarian reserve each month and therefore how many eggs she is likely to still have in the ovarian reserve. now there's a noninvasive way to do this, as well. Although, typically, an OB/GYN will do both what I just described with ultrasound and measure something called AMH, which is anti-Müllerian hormone, which is a hormone that is released by that antral follicle population, the population of follicles and eggs that leave the ovarian reserve each month. So one is a blood draw measure of a hormone, AMH. The other is a structural imaging measure of the antral follicles directly. again the typical trend is for the number of antral follicles to decline over time. So one might expect, for instance, that a woman in her 20s or 30s might have 20, 30, maybe even 40 antral follicles that are exiting the reserve each month. And again, that's the total across both ovaries. Again, these are just averages. These are going to be distributions. There will be people with far fewer. There will be people with far more. But that over time, regardless of where a woman starts out, from one decade to the next half decade and decade and so on, that the number of antral follicles will decline and the amount of or the levels of AMH will also decline. So what does this all mean? What this means is that if you are a woman who is in her 20s or 30s or 40s, whatever your age, if you are interested in conceiving in the future, it's very likely a good idea to go to your OB/GYN and get either your AMH levels measured or your follicle count measured and to do that several times in a given period. And I don't mean a menstrual period. I mean given a period of time across several months to determine what is the average number of follicles, what's your average AMH level, thereby giving you some window into how many eggs you are likely to still have in your ovarian reserve. I cannot tell you how many women that I've spoken to and how many OB/GYNs-- more importantly, because they speak to many more women about this than I ever have or ever will-- wish that they had done this earlier. They think, oh, well, I'm in my 20s, so I'm likely to have a ton of follicles, or they got pregnant once before, and so they're not so concerned about the number of follicles or their AMH levels. But over and over again, I was told in researching for this episode that the earlier and more frequent that women do this procedure of measuring AMH and measuring their follicle count, the higher the probability that they will eventually have a successful fertilization and pregnancy when they seek to do so. Now, the mirror image of all this, of course, is the sperm. And there's a kind of common misconception out there that, you know, the sperm, you only need one. And indeed you only need one. But actually, you need many, and it's only one that's able to successfully fertilize the egg. So this whole concept of you only need one is both dismissive of the sperm but more importantly dismissive of the biology of the sperm and the egg. It only takes one successful sperm and one successful egg, but that's sort of like telling a woman, hey, you only need one egg. You need one egg of sufficient quality in the right time and place, and you need one sperm of sufficient quality in the right time and place in order to get successful fertilization and hopefully pregnancy. But you need a lot of sperm in order to get a high probability that that one sperm will be able to successfully fertilize the egg. So we have this image of sperm as these dumb operators that just sort of swim mindlessly towards anything. And if they bump into an egg, then they fertilize the egg. And that's really not the way it works. As I talked about earlier, the sperm-- with its head, its mid region, its tail, chock a block with mitochondria in the mid region-- is really an active motile cell that indeed will just swim forward, if it's a healthy, forward progressing sperm. But many males out there just simply do not have any knowledge of how many quality sperm that they happen to have. Now, given the fact that sperm analysis is relatively inexpensive and also the fact that freezing sperm is relatively inexpensive, I think it stands to reason that most men should at least get some window into the number and quality of their sperm. Now, it's a fair assumption to say that if someone is in their late teens or early 20s or 30s that they probably have high-quality sperm. But again, as with the egg and the importance of measuring AMH and follicle count across time, men should really evaluate the quality and number of their sperm. And we talked a little bit earlier about some of the parameters that urologists and OB/GYNs like to see when evaluating sperm. There's a minimum number or concentration of sperm that they'd like to see if a couple is going to use IVF, in-vitro fertilization. And typically that's going to be about 15 to 20 million per mil of sperm or semen. And typically they want to see somewhere between 2 and 5 milliliters of semen, overall, in a given ejaculate after a 72 to 48 hour abstinence period, because, of course, the more ejaculations, the smaller the volume of the ejaculate in a short period of time. But after 48 to 72 hours, you more or less maximize the volume of ejaculate. And then, of course, they want to see 50% but typically 60% or more of motile sperm in order to get IVF, but more is better. And of course, there is an enormous range, as I mentioned before. Some males will have anywhere from 10 to 20 million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate, and some men will have 100 to 200 million. But just because they have 100 to 200 million doesn't mean that all of those sperm are of high quality and can fertilize eggs. Sometimes more than half will be twitchers, and some will be immotile, and so on and so forth. So it's very straightforward what I believe most people should do and what the urologists I spoke to in advance of this episode said to do, which is to simply do a sperm analysis. Refrain from ejaculation for 48 to 72 hours. Give a sperm sample. Have that sperm sample analyzed. The cost of the sperm analysis is not typically that much. And considering that conception and healthy conception and fertilization is an expensive process if you have to go the in-vitro fertilization route, it stands to reason that the cost is pretty well justified. You also have the option to freeze sperm over time. There is evidence that the age of the father and therefore the age of the sperm can dictate whether or not there's a higher incidence of problematic pregnancy or developmental outcomes, including autism. That is true. You've probably heard that if the father is 40 years or older, the incidence of autism is increased significantly. That is true. Although the overall probability of having an autistic offspring if somebody-- if the father, that is-- is 40 years or older is still quite a bit lower than you would imagine. It's not as if the probability suddenly skyrockets. So we'll have an episode on autism and genetic and non-genetic influences on autism and other aspects of the autism spectrum. But the point is this. I believe and the urologists I spoke to who are interested in fertility and male health and sexual health suggest that men get their sperm analyzed at least once every five years and certainly, if they're going to want to conceive children in the distant future, that they consider freezing their sperm because that, too, is fairly nominal cost in order to freeze sperm at a younger age. And of course, if you can freeze and use sperm from the time in which you were younger, why wouldn't you, right? I mean, you can still opt to go for natural pregnancy later if that's what you want to do. But having that in reserve is generally a good idea. And I discussed some of the parameters that are looked for. And perhaps most importantly, there is the possibility of an underlying issue whereby, for instance, there is very little sperm in an ejaculate. As I mentioned earlier, the seminal fluid in the ejaculate could have zero sperm in it, but the volume of ejaculate could appear completely normal. So just because your ejaculate volume is normal to you or is in that range of 2 to 5 milliliters, well, then that doesn't necessarily mean that there are any sperm there or that there are very few sperm there and the few sperm that are there or the many sperm that there are functionally motile. So get this analyzed. It's really worth doing. And again, it's not something you have to do every year. It's something that you want to do probably every five years, at least until the point where you've conceived as many children as you ever want to conceive. So the basic takeaway here is that, if you're a woman, to get your egg count-- your antral follicle count, that is-- and therefore your reserve of eggs, indirectly measured, and of course also get your AMH levels measured, and if you're a male to have a sperm analysis and to do that relatively early. In fact, another incentive for doing that early is that you have a comparison point so that, for instance, if you are in your early 20s and you're not thinking about having kids at all or you're thinking that you might someday have kids but it's a really someday, someday, far off in the future, well, it's wonderful to have a reference point from which to compare your biology in your early 20s to your biology in your mid or late 30s or 40s when you might happen to be interested in conceiving. And if that doesn't provide incentive enough, I should mention-- and this is important to point out and that I think both males and females are not aware of-- is that one in five couples that have issues with fertility, the issue ends up falling on the biology that is the quality of the sperm or a lack of number of sperm. So I think there's a misconception that when fertility is an issue it's always an issue with the eggs and this age-dependent decline in the egg quality-- again, it's the best language we have available to us at the moment-- this age-dependent decline in egg quality is often to blame, but not always. One in five couples that have challenges conceiving it turns out that it's going to be an issue with the sperm. And of course, there are a number of different sperm analyses that, should all the other parameters of sperm appear normal, now, for instance, you can get a DNA fragmentation analysis. You can see whether or not the DNA of the sperm are somehow disrupted. Urologists these days are excellent at figuring out, for instance, if a male has lots and lots of sperm, everything looks great, but the shape of the head of the sperm isn't quite right-- if it's not oval enough and it's too rounded, that could be a genetic defect under which conditions there is zero probability of the male ever naturally conceiving, regardless of who the female partner is. Believe it or not, males can have a ton of sperm, but if they carry a certain genetic defect, those sperm will be incapable of depositing those 23 chromosomes into the egg. However, there are ways in which that sperm can be coaxed or forced to fertilize the egg and deposit its genetic contents by in-vitro fertilization and then implantation into the female. So again, lots of reasons to have a egg reserve analysis by ultrasound and AMH for females and lots of reasons for males to have a sperm analysis. And of course, typically with a sperm analysis and a ovarian reserve analysis will be a hormone analysis. And I'm a very strong believer in people getting an insight-- that is, a window-- into their hormonal composition, not just when they encounter problems but starting at a pretty early age, even if it's only done once every five years or so, having a reference point to your 20s and to your 30s and mid-30s for when you felt a certain way. Maybe, as in the case for many people I know, they actually feel better in their 40s than they did in their 20s because they're doing a lot of things to support their health. That is possible. But in many cases, people start feeling not as well or their fertility seems to be dropping off or any number of different parameters that we've discussed today were related to vitality and longevity seem to be dropping off over time, and they want to get a insight into what could be the issue. And hormones are sometimes, not always, but sometimes involved in those underlying issues. And there is nothing as valuable as having a reference point from a time in which things were going well to evaluate the, for instance, levels of hormones, not just testosterone but also estrogen and progesterone and so forth. So you need a comparison point in order to determine what really needs to be changed. So all of this is a strong push for people to use your insurance, if you're able to put it on insurance-- oftentimes people are-- and if not, to try and find a reasonable or reasonably priced way to do a sperm and egg analysis and to ideally do a hormone analysis as well. It's really going to set you up for the maximum probability of being able to conceive children when you want to and also to avoid a bunch of other health-related issues that involve hormones and reproductive health and, in general, to support your mental health and physical health. So I've been talking about a bunch of things to do. There are a couple of things to be mindful of to actively avoid if your goal is to be and remain fertile. And that's regardless of whether or not you want to conceive children in the future or not. Now, in the context of this discussion, the same things that we've heard to be true for other aspects of our health turn out to also be true. So let's just start with the basics. Everybody should be getting approximately six to eight hours of sleep every night. That should be quality sleep. Optimizing your sleep is fundamental to balancing your hormones. Now, balancing your hormones is kind of a catch phrase for all things related to proper hormone regulation. Sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health, physical health, and performance of all kinds and, believe it or not, fertility. When people are not sleeping well or enough, stress hormones, in particular cortisol, shift to peaking later in the day, and those elevated cortisol levels later in the day cause a bunch of different problems in both males and females, many of which impact fertility. So controlling cortisol starts with controlling your sleep. It also impacts testosterone and estrogen levels. So of course, the proper ratios of testosterone and estrogen will vary from males to females. But in order to get those right or as right as they can be without other interventions, you want to make sure you're getting enough quality sleep. How much sleep? Most people need about six to eight hours of sleep per night. Waking up once, maybe twice per night in the middle of the night and going back to sleep is not such a big deal, but six to eight hours of solid sleep would be ideal. Some people need a little bit less in order to function-- five hours. Some people need a little bit more. Developing teenagers and babies and kids need a lot more. People who are sick or recovering from injury need a lot more. We've done multiple episodes on sleep. We have a toolkit for sleep available free at hubermanlab.com. You go there. You don't even have to sign up for the newsletter, although you can if you want. Just go to a Toolkit for Sleep under the menu, and you'll be able to download that, or you can even just view it on the screen if you don't want to download it. It has lots of tools. We've done an episode called "Perfect Your Sleep" that has a lot of tools. They're all timestamped for you. We've done a "Master Your Sleep" episode, so lots of tools to get your sleep right. Get your sleep right if you are wishing to conceive and/or to simply have healthy biology, to be fertile, or otherwise. That's just fundamental. Now, there are other things to not do. And those, again, fall into the somewhat obvious categories, but I think a lot of people aren't aware of just how striking an effect these certain behaviors that you want to avoid can have in diminishing your fertility for both males and females. So let's talk about those. The first one is smoking. And when we talk about smoking here, we're talking about smoking nicotine and we're talking about smoking cannabis. And indeed, there are strong data-- and I will put a reference to one of the better larger analyses of these data. There are strong data showing that cannabis reduces fertility. Now, I can already hear the screams from the back, although they're probably fairly drawled out screams, from the back of people saying they smoke cannabis and they had no trouble conceiving. Certainly, there will be exceptions. But whether or not you're male or female, smoking cannabis is a bad idea if you want to conceive a healthy child. Can you still conceive a healthy child while smoking cannabis? Probably certain people can. Many people will greatly decrease the probability of a healthy fertilization and pregnancy by smoking cannabis. There are excellent data to support that. As well, nicotine, both smoked or vaped, is going to disrupt the process of fertilization and can disrupt pregnancy dramatically. So just avoid it altogether. How does this happen? Well, it turns out that smoking increases what are called reactive oxygen species. This greatly disrupts the quality of the egg at the level of the spindle and mitochondria and a number of other features. And in the sperm, turns out that smoking doesn't necessarily disrupt the sperm directly, although it can cause DNA fragmentation, which can cause all sorts of abnormalities, can prevent fertilization, can lead to birth defects in the offspring. But more importantly, it increases what are called reactive oxygen species in the seminal fluid, in the semen that contain the sperm, this very, under normal circumstances, under healthy circumstances, beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid that allows the sperm to thrive in their trajectory and attempt to fertilize the egg and lead to a healthy pregnancy. So if you are a smoker and you want to conceive, the best advice I can give you is to quit smoking. And yes, that includes cannabis as well. Now, I am not somebody who believes that cannabis across the board is not useful. There are medical applications and other applications. I talk about that in an episode all about cannabis for health and disease. And notice, health was in there too. So you cannabis smokers, don't come after me with-- I guess, whatever it is-- with bongs and pipes or whatever it is that you want-- or with vapes. The point is that, while it can be beneficial for certain populations, it's certainly bad for others. And if you're trying to conceive, it is bad for fertility and for a healthy pregnancy. Now, that's smoking-- and vaping, by the way. Vaping is included there. Now, the next category of don'ts relates to alcohol. Now, everyone has heard that drinking during pregnancy is a bad idea. You may have heard and some people have talked about the fact that there are cultures in which they allow, if you will, or even condone, sadly, one or two drinks while pregnant, provided it's just champagne or something of that sort. That is a terrible idea. I did an episode all about alcohol, both its potential health effects, of which there turned out to be zero. And yes, that includes red wine. It is far better to not drink at all. And if you're going to drink, the limit-- if you're a healthy adult who's not trying to conceive, not pregnant, and you don't have issues with alcoholism-- is probably two drinks per week total. That's right, two drinks per week total. And that's the level that you really should consider if you're a drinker if you're somebody who's trying to conceive. However, for a woman who becomes pregnant, the total number of drinks that you should allow yourself per week while pregnant and breastfeeding is indeed zero. There is absolutely no evidence that one can, quote, unquote, "get away" with drinking during pregnancy. And people say, well, I had a perfectly healthy child. But, of course, you don't know what the health of that child would have been had you not drank at all. Now, I'm not here with any generally strong stance against alcohol. I myself am somebody who has a drink every once in a while, although I don't consider myself somebody who has a strong proclivity for alcohol. And of course, at this moment, I'm not trying to conceive children and I'm certainly not pregnant. So that's safe for me. But frankly, I haven't had a drink in a very long time. And so I don't miss it. And that's me. But I do realize that a lot of people enjoy alcohol, and so it's that two drinks per week limit that really sets the upper limit and threshold beyond which you start running into issues with cellular mutation. You start running into issues of oxidative stress, greatly increase cancer risk, in particular breast cancer risk. All of that's covered in the alcohol episode that we did. You can find it at hubermanlab.com and timestamped if you want to navigate to specific topics and so forth, find out all about the data supporting the statements that I'm making, so on and so forth. Now, if you're somebody who's seeking to conceive or you fall into this category that some couples describe themselves as we're not trying but we're not not trying-- meaning they're not using birth control, they're kind of letting chance run its course-- well, then you should definitely be aware of the data showing that even just one bout, one bout of so-called binge drinking, which is five to six drinks in a given night or half day, in a 12-hour period-- one bout of five to six drinks, if you're a woman or you're a man, greatly increases both the likelihood of mutations in the embryo that would result from a fertilization and at the same time, for reasons that should be obvious to you based on all the biology we've talked about, a greatly reduced probability of fertilization. Now, that absolutely does not mean that you should use the ingestion of five or six drinks as a method of birth control. That is not what I'm saying here. What I'm saying is that, if you go out on a given night and you have five or six drinks and you happen to become pregnant, the probability that that pregnancy will be disrupted in some way is greatly increased. What the exact consequences are, no one can tell you. But also, if you're somebody who is interested in conceiving a child, well, then you absolutely should abstain from ingesting drinks more than one or two during the time in which you're trying to conceive, and ideally it would be zero. And you certainly would want to avoid drinking multiple drinks per night. And so this idea of going out and having three or four drinks or four or five drinks in a given night at a time in which you're also trying to conceive children, the biology tells us, the epidemiology tells us that this is just a terrible idea. It's going to reduce the likelihood of fertility and successful pregnancy. And if there is a successful pregnancy, the word "success" needs to be in quotes, right? I mean, I think every parent-- every species, for that matter-- wants to increase the probability of having healthy offspring. And so, to my mind anyway and to the OB/GYNs and the urologists that are focused on fertility that I spoke to, everyone will say, try as hard as you can to avoid these so-called binge drinking episodes. And again, these episodes are one night of consuming five to six drinks. Now, another important thing to remember in this context is that the negative effects of consuming five or six drinks in a given night extend over many weeks following the ingestion of that alcohol. If you're a male, what that means is that's going to impact the quality of your sperm and greatly decrease the likelihood of successful fertilization and/or healthy pregnancy over the period of that entire spermatogenesis window, which is, as we talked about before, 60 to 90 days, 60 to generate the sperm and then some additional time for the sperm to be transported to the point where they could be ejaculated. If you're a woman and you have five or six drinks on a given night, well, then you are going to disrupt the quality not of just the egg that eventually ovulates but indeed the entire pool of follicles that leaves the ovarian vault in reserve and from which the one egg will be selected. In other words, you are reducing the quality of all of the eggs that you happen to deploy that month. Now, some of you who were really following the biology earlier might say, well, what if I have those five or six drinks during the time in which I'm menstruating, just in which there's bleeding present? And therefore, I haven't yet ovulated. Ah! But if you remember the biology we talked about earlier specifically, there is a subset of follicles and eggs that leave that ovarian reserve quite a bit before that one egg is selected for and ovulates. And of course, there are all the different hormonal cascades and the general milieu of the ovary which are important and are being regulated by different hormones. And yes, indeed, the regulation of those hormones is strongly impacted by alcohol through a number of different pathways, through the regulation of the neurotransmitter GABA up in the brain-- it's actually a lot of GABA and GABA receptors in the hypothalamus, the very region from which gonadotropin-releasing hormone, our old friend from a couple hours ago in this discussion, going to disrupt GnRH secretion. You can disrupt pituitary function with alcohol. Again and again, what we're seeing is that consuming more than one or two drinks per week of alcohol is really detrimental to the entire process of fertility and the entire process of healthy pregnancy. And that's true from both the male side and the sperm, and it's true from the female side and the egg. So my simple advice on this is if you are wishing to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy, the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol altogether and, if you are going to drink, to really limit that drinking to one or two drinks per week maximum. So those are the major don'ts. Really avoid excessive stress. And I should mention, excessive stress is not just best avoided by getting enough quality sleep at night. Although that is the primary way. There are other ways to avoid stress. We've done entire episodes about this, and we have a toolkit related to reducing stress with very simple, zero-cost tools. Again, you can find all that at hubermanlab.com. And I should mention, if you want to find any episode or topic or timestamp, that website is keyword search available. So you can just go to hubermanlab.com, put into the search function "stress tools," and a bunch of different links will pop up related to those topics, likewise with sleep, likewise with any number of different topics you might be interested in. So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools to buffer stress that I've talked about in the episodes that you can access. And there are ways to greatly reduce your overall level of stress, to limit any cortisol that's released to early in the day, which is when you want cortisol released, and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth. So reduce your stress. And as I just told you, by all means, do not drink more than two drinks per week. And zero is better than two. If anyone tells you, oh, well, there's all this resveratrol in red wine, and that's good for us, the data simply tell us there's not enough resveratrol in red wine to really have any positive health benefit. The data around resveratrol and health benefits itself is under question nowadays. Zero alcohol is better than any alcohol. Two drinks per week is the limit. Also, limit or eliminate or avoid nicotine and ideally cannabis, smoking and vaping, at the time in which you are trying to get pregnant. And certainly, if you are pregnant, avoid all of the things, as best you can, that I just described a moment ago. Now, there are a couple of other don'ts that are really important. One of the most important don'ts relates to STIs, or sexually-transmitted infections. Everyone who is sexually active should get an STI check. In fact, if you go to a fertility clinic or you go for sperm analysis or you go for egg analysis, almost always they will do an STI check, even if you happen to be in a monogamous relationship, even if you happen to be not sexually active and you're somebody who is seeking to use IVF with a sperm donor or something of that sort. Why would they do that? Why is there so much concern about that? Is it about avoiding giving birth to a child that has something like a herpes infection or HIV? Well, certainly that's one reason, but that's a down-the-line reason, because at the time when someone goes into the clinic for one of these sperm or egg analyses, that's well in advance of any pregnancy, right? The reason is there are a number of STIs-- in particular chlamydia-- for which it greatly increases the probability of miscarriage. So chlamydia is one of those very insidious and cryptic STIs because a lot of people, both males and females, don't even realize that they have chlamydia, and then they can carry chlamydia at the time in which they conceive, and then that can lead to ectopic pregnancies and/or miscarriages. So by all means, get an STI check if you are somebody who's seeking to conceive children or evaluating your fertility generally. Chlamydia can also have damaging effects on the epididymis and on the various other aspects of male reproductive health. In the future, we will do an episode all about sexual health. This is not the time for that. But get an STI check if your goal is to conceive a healthy child. Now, the other thing that can have a very negative impact on fertility and healthy pregnancy is a viral infection. For instance, if a male has had a severe viral illness-- and this could be any number of different viral illnesses, from flu to cold or any number of different viruses. Pick your favorite virus-- in the previous 70 to 90 days, that can greatly diminish the number and/or quality of sperm. So that's really important. This is also important if you're going to go in and do a sperm analysis and you had a viral infection in the previous 70 to 90 days. Well, then you need to be aware of that because it could greatly impact the parameters of that sperm analysis. Likewise, for women, if you've had a serious viral infection in the previous 30 days, does that mean you should not try and conceive? Not necessarily, but you should talk to your OB/GYN about that. There are data showing that viral infection-- in particular of influenza-- in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy has some correlation-- it's not 100%-- but some correlation with negative mental health outcomes of the offspring sometime later, including schizophrenia. This is some of the work that was done at Caltech a number of years ago and other laboratories, as well. Those data are still being built up over time. Again, it's not one-for-one. It's not causal. So if you did get an influenza or a cold or other kind of viral infection during the first trimester or any trimester of pregnancy, I don't want to cause alarm, but you should talk to your OB/GYN about this. The goal, of course, is to avoid viral illness at any time when you're trying to conceive or have a healthy pregnancy. But of course, sometimes people will get ill, and the children can turn out to be perfectly normal and fine. But it is something that you want to avoid. And it will impact your egg analysis, and it will impact sperm analysis. And one thing I found really surprising in researching this episode was that 1 in 25 men carry a copy of a mutation for cystic fibrosis. Now, some of you are probably familiar with cystic fibrosis as a condition that can cause issues with the lungs, the accumulation of fluid in the lungs or other tissues. Cystic fibrosis, in order to express that way of accumulation of fluid in the lungs, you really need two copies. You need two mutant copies or you need two copies of the cystic fibrosis gene. 1 in 25 men will carry just one copy and therefore will not have any symptoms of cystic fibrosis. But those 1 in 25 men will have defects in the architecture of the vas deferens, the duct through which the ejaculate needs to pass in order to eventually be ejaculated out of the urethra. And so what that means is that these men can have what appears to be normal semen volume but that they won't have normal numbers of sperm. And that's not because of a deficit in making the sperm. The testes can function just fine. The brain and the pituitary are communicating with the testes just fine. But that literally the passageway by which those sperm arrive within the seminal fluid and are eventually ejaculated is disrupted by the cystic fibrosis gene. Luckily, if somebody has just one copy of the cystic fibrosis gene and they're male and this is the issue, the vas deferens either can be repaired by a urologist who's expert in the surgical repair of vas deferens or sperm can be extracted from the testicle directly, which might sound like a painful procedure, but I believe nowadays, in talking with various experts on this, it turns out that it can be done with a minimum of discomfort. And certainly, if the goal is to have a healthy child, you're going to need those sperm, so you're going to want to get them one way or the other, regardless of the discomfort. Now, before getting into some of the things that you can do in the positive sense to increase your fertility, we do need to touch on just a few other things that you want to avoid in order to avoid diminishing your fertility. And this mainly relates to males, but it will also be relevant to females. And of course, when I say also relevant to females, I'm referring to the fact that, if it's a woman and a man who are trying to conceive, then she, of course, is going to be interested in her egg quality but also the sperm quality. And of course, there are women who are conceiving by way of sperm donor, through IVF or IUI or otherwise. But in any case, the need to understand and maximize the quality of both the egg and the sperm is paramount. So in order for men to maximize the quality of their sperm, as I mentioned earlier, does not seem to be a big difference whether or not they use boxers or briefs or whether or not they, quote, unquote, "go commando," they don't wear any boxers or briefs of any kind. However, it is important to keep the testicles cool enough. They need to be about 2 degrees cooler than the rest of the body. And there are a number of different ways to do that. As I mentioned before, avoid going in hot tubs during the period in which you're trying to conceive children. You should also avoid going in saunas during the period in which you are trying to conceive children. And if you do go in the sauna, you can bring an ice pack there and you can put it on the testicles in order to offset the heat of the sauna and keep the testicles cool while in the sauna. The other thing that you'll definitely want to do is avoid putting a laptop or any other hot device directly onto your lap. There are a number of different devices that you can put on your lap. You could put books or a box or there are these devices that are designed to dispel the heat from the laptop. I would say, if you're trying to conceive, just keep the laptop off of your lap. Just put it on a table or standing desk or whatever. Just keep it off of your lap. Also, there are some really interesting data showing that the amount of time that men spend sitting, regardless of whether or not they sit with their ankle on their opposite knee or with knees spread, the classic man spread stance, or any other kind of seated stance is going to increase the temperature of the scrotum for reasons that are somewhat obvious if you think about the architecture of all this. I think both men and women, if you put enough thought to it, you go, oh yeah, that would increase the temperature. Obviously avoid seat heaters in cars or otherwise. But reducing the total amount of time that you spend seated is really important if you want to keep the temperature milieu of the scrotum optimal for sperm quality and fertilization. And as I mentioned earlier, it's going to be important to make sure that your legs are not really big to the point where they are creating a hotter than is healthy environment for the scrotum and testicles. So a hotter than normal environment for the testicles can be caused by legs that are very large, upper thighs that are very large due to obesity or due to those upper thighs being too muscular. So by all means, don't skip leg day. But be aware that if you're somebody who's trying to conceive, you want to do whatever you can to reduce the temperature of the scrotum or at least not let it get too hot for too long. So I can think of all sorts of reasons now that men are going to come up with to do the man spread stance of their knees really far apart, even further if they have large legs. That's not a discussion we want to have here, and that's not really what today's discussion is about. Really the principle is what's most important, which is to keep the temperature of the scrotum and testicles lower than the rest of your body. There's a direct blood flow from the body to the testicle that provides blood flow. It's designed in a way that that blood pathway should be outside the body and as far away from the body as possible in order to get the temperature milieu of the scrotum and testicle correct for healthy sperm quality. Now, a topic that is sure to be a bit controversial-- but it really shouldn't be because the data, at least to me, are very clear-- is this issue of phone use and sperm quality. Now, this can open up a whole array of issues related to things like EMFs, and you've got people out there who have ideas about 5G and all of this stuff. That is not what this discussion is about. The discussion I'm about to have with you relates to the fact that the electromagnetic fields and the heat-related effects of smartphones can indeed have a detrimental effect on sperm quality and, yes, indeed, on testosterone levels as well. I'm going to refer you to a paper. We will link it in the show note captions. The title of this paper is "Effects of Mobile Phone Usage on Sperm Quality. No time-dependent relationship on usage. A systematic review and updated meta-analysis." This is the paper that came out in 2021 and talks about the fact that phones emit a radio frequency electromagnetic waves, which are called RF, radio frequency, EMWs, electromagnetic waves, at a low level between 80 and 2,200 megahertz that can be absorbed by the human body-- we know this. This is not controversial-- and have potential adverse effects on brain, heart, endocrine system, and reproductive function. That has been established. Keep in mind, there is basically no controversy that radio frequency waves and EMFs can have a negative impact on biological tissues. The question is, how intense are those radiofrequency waves and EMFs, and how detrimental are those on those biological tissues? It's a matter of degrees. But there is very little controversy as to whether or not they have an effect on biological tissues. And I'm aware of absolutely zero data showing that they can have a positive effect on biological tissues. Since what we're mainly talking about now are smartphones, we want to separate out the heat effects of smartphones from the EMFs related to the fact that they are Wi-Fi smartphones or they're using cellular towers and Wi-Fi, one or the other or a combination. So there are a number of different things in the phone that could be detrimental. We need to separate those out. Why? Well, because you might have heard that carrying your phone in your pocket can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count. And guess what, that is true. The data contained within this meta-analyses and other meta-analyses clearly point out that it can reduce sperm count and maybe testosterone levels significantly, but certainly sperm count and motility significantly. It reduces sperm quality. So should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket, certainly your front pocket? I would suggest yes, if you are somebody who is seeking to conceive. I'm not somebody who is going to stop using my smartphone. I don't expect anyone's going to stop using their smartphone. The question is, should you carry it in your front pocket if you're a male? I think, to be on the safe side, the answer is probably avoid doing that too much of the time. Ideally, don't do it at all. Then people will say, well, what if I turn off the Wi-Fi or I turn off the cellular access? Then is it still a problem? Well, it's a problem due to the heat-related effects. And then people say, well, I don't actually feel the heat of the phone. It doesn't get that warm. But the temperature effects of the phone, it turns out, are enough, even under conditions in which people don't report it to be uncomfortably warm, that it can change the temperature milieu of the testicle in ways that can diminish sperm quality. How much and how that relates to fertility and healthy pregnancy, not clear, but since we're talking about things to avoid, if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy, well, then, by all means, just don't carry it in your front pocket. Then people say, well, what about back pocket or what about backpack? Look, it's very clear that avoiding being too close to the phone is probably better for your sperm quality than putting the phone very close to your testicles or anywhere else on your body. But it's also the reality that most people are going to carry a phone nowadays. It's just the reality. I think the current estimates-- and it's discussed in this paper-- that 90% of the human population has a smartphone-- 90%, which is incredible-- the adult population, of course. Although a lot of kids have them, as well. So this paper goes on to detail a number of different studies and outcomes from studies. But basically what they find-- and here I'm paraphrasing-- is that the data indicate that sperm quality declines when people start using a mobile phone. So from the point they start using a mobile phone, regardless of the usage time-- this is important. It used to be thought that it was four hours a day or more of holding your phone or having that phone close to your body was going to diminish sperm quality. It turns out that it's not related to usage time. That's even the title of the paper. It's just the fact that people are using mobile phones is reducing sperm count and quality. That's the reality. Is it entirely responsible for all the reductions in sperm quality and maybe even the reductions in testosterone levels that we're observing from decade to decade going forward? I doubt that's the case. Is it likely to be one of the major players? I've got my bet on the fact that it is based on the data that I've observed. And so if any of you would like to peruse the data in this meta-analysis, they're quite good. This study looked at 18 studies that include 4,280 samples. They were able to separate out the radio frequency versus the heat effects, and they were able to eliminate this time of usage variable, that previously we thought if you were exposed to a lot of cell phone contact, then it was far worse than if you were exposed to a little bit. Turns out, if you're exposed to any at all, you're going to diminish sperm quality. What does that mean? Does that mean that no matter what you do, if you own a smartphone, that you're going to diminish sperm quality? I think the short answer is yes, but that you can mitigate it. What might you do? Well, keeping your phone away from your groin or as far from your groin as possible if you're a male who's wishing to conceive and maybe even a male who's wishing to maximize his testosterone levels because it does appear that radiofrequency waves and the heat from the phone-- so both of those factors, independently and together, of course-- can disrupt the Leydig cells of the testes and the production of testosterone, and intratesticular testosterone is important for sperm production. The exact biological variables leading to all of these changes isn't exactly clear. But if you're like me, you say, OK, probably not a problem for most males to carry their phone. But probably best to not carry it in the front pocket. Maybe even avoid carrying it in the back pocket as well. Again, in the future, we will have an episode all about Bluetooth. We'll talk about various aspects of EMFs. It's a super interesting data set. And it's a data set for which there's a ton of controversy. It's really interesting, however, and there are more and more quality data coming out all the time. And I think, going forward, we are going to see that, indeed, there are some negative effects of smartphones related to both the radio frequency transmission and the fact that they generate heat. And in general, heat is not good for biological tissues. So any discussion about heat and sperm and how heat is detrimental to sperm has to raise this issue of whether or not cold is good for the testicle. OK, well, now there's a lot of data starting to come out about the positive effects, the positive biological effects, of deliberate cold exposure on different aspects of brain biology, such as the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, and on the biology of the body, to some extent metabolism but more so the impact on brown fat stores, which are good for us, so-called brown fat thermogenesis. There's a lot related to deliberate cold exposure, and we've done entire episodes on deliberate cold exposure. Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com. We did a guest episode with an expert on the use of cold for health and performance with my colleague Craig Heller from Stanford Department of Biology. We also have a toolkit on how to apply deliberate, cold exposure for health for both females and for males-- for sports performance, cognitive performance, mood, sleep, et cetera. You can find all that, again, at hubermanlab.com. Totally zero cost. Just go into the menu, go to newsletter, and scroll down, and you'll find those. When thinking about sperm quality, we want remember that excessive heat is bad. Now, does that mean that deliberate cold is good? Well, it turns out that one of the major causes of lowered sperm count and overall reduced sperm quality that's quite common is the presence of what's called a varicocele. A varicocele is kind of like varicose veins of the veins that innervate the testicle. And what it essentially does is it means that blood will pool in the testicular region. It can't circulate back to the body quickly enough. And therefore, the temperature of that environment increases. There are some other things that varicoceles do which can be obstructive at the physical level. So they're not just temperature related. It's pretty clear that using deliberate cold exposure can be healthy for the sperm because of the ways not that cold directly supports testosterone or sperm quality but rather because cold reduces heat. So you will find available online-- I think they're actually called-- forgive me, but that's what they're called. I didn't name them-- called snowballs. These are-- they're sort of like gel pack cold briefs that you can buy and men will wear for some period of time. I don't think you wear them all day. You wear them for some period of time. A lot of people are now using cold showers and ice baths and circulating cold baths or going into a cold ocean or lake for any number of different reasons I talked about earlier. I, myself, start every day with either a one to three-minute cold shower or a one to three-minute immersion up to my neck in a cold bath, cold water, circulating water, or a cold shower. I do that mainly for the psychological effects related to the long lasting increases in dopamine and epinephrine. But there are other data starting to come out showing that that sort of approach or similar approaches can increase testosterone levels and maybe even sperm counts, can reduce cortisol late in the evening if the cold exposure is done early in the day, so on and so forth. So a lot of interesting data coming out in really good journals that are peer-reviewed and so on-- in humans, I should mention, those studies are done in humans-- to support the use of deliberate cold exposure. But again, if you're going to use deliberate cold exposure to improve sperm quality, can it work? Yes, indeed, it can work, either indirectly by increasing testosterone or directly by improving sperm quality. But both of those effects are likely to be indirect by virtue of reducing the temperature of the testicle overall, not because there's any sort of magic effect of cold on the testicle. Now, I have to imagine that a number of you, in particular the females listening to this, are going to say, is deliberate cold exposure-- and for that matter, is deliberate heat exposure, like sauna or hot tub-- good or bad for the ovary, for eggs, and for fertility? Now, there are fewer data to look to, unfortunately. But what we do know is that deliberate cold exposure done in the way that I just described-- one to three minutes a day, ideally early in the day, through cold shower or immersion up to the neck-- doesn't have to be an ice bath. It could be cold circulating water or even non-circulating cold water. And people will say, well, how cold? I should have mentioned that before. How cold? There is no way I can tell you exactly how cold the water should be, because for some people, 60 degrees Fahrenheit will be exceedingly cold. For other people, 40 degrees is going to be more appropriate. How cold should you make it? If you're going to embrace these practices, you want-- according to the literature, what you want to do is make it uncomfortably cold such that you really want to get out, but safe. You don't want to go into 30-degree water immediately. You can actually have a heart attack and die if you do that. So you want to progress gradually into the cold. So you don't want to shock your system too much. Although it is the adrenaline evoked by that [GASPS],, that quickening or shortening or elimination of the breath for a short period of time when you get into uncomfortably cold water that correlates with or is actually the reflection of-- would be more accurate to say-- the release of adrenaline and then dopamine and so forth, which has been very well documented. So uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in. And I cannot tell you an exact number that is uncomfortably cold but safe for you. It's going to differ person by person. You want to figure that out. Just like I can't tell you how much weight that you should squat in order to achieve some effective resistance training for the legs, it's going to differ depending on your strength and your prior experience and so forth. So ease into it. Be safe. But it does appear that both for men, for reasons I talked about a few minutes ago, and for women that deliberate, cold exposure can be beneficial for fertility and for hormone production, but in particular for females in terms of regulating cortisol and for hormone production. Now, you might say, OK, getting into cold is stressful. How can that be helpful for regulating stress? Well, it turns out, when you get into the cold, you get a big surge in adrenaline and then dopamine, which is very long lasting, provided that's done in the early part of the day. So I would say, not too close to sleep. Then what you do is you restrict your maximum cortisol release to a period earlier in the day that buffers-- reduces, that is-- the likelihood that you would have excessive amounts of cortisol later in the day, which not only can disrupt sleep but is correlated with a number of other hormonal effects that are not good for us and therefore not good for fertility. So here what I'm describing are positive yet indirect effects of a cold on hormone levels both in males and in females. So for men, we talked about increased testosterone, improved sperm quality that was indirect. You're reducing the temperature of the testicle. But it's not that cold itself is positively impacting those things. Does that make sense? Heat is bad. Therefore, reducing temperature is good. Likewise, with females, deliberate cold exposure can be good for the overall fertility process, not because cold is good for the ovary or being cold is good for the ovary or for luteinizing hormone or for follicle-stimulating hormone or anything else like that, but rather that using deliberate cold exposure as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate way to a particular time of day increases the release of cortisol, then, and indirectly reduces the amount of cortisol that's released at other times along the 24-hour cycle. So these are positive yet indirect effects. So if you're a woman who really is interested in exploring deliberate cold exposure or who enjoys it or is already doing it and you're wishing to conceive, great. Explore it. Do it safely, of course, but explore it and continue to do it. However, if you're somebody who just hates the cold and doesn't want to go anywhere near it, there's no reason to think that you absolutely need it, provided that your stress, your sleep, and other factors are all being carried out properly. The next things that we'll talk about in terms of positive things or things that we can do in order to maximize fertility for both females and males are the things that you also generally hear about elsewhere. Right along with sleep and avoiding alcohol and avoiding nicotine and avoiding cannabis, avoiding excessive heat for the testicle, avoiding excessive stress, is that you want to try to get enough exercise. Why would exercise have anything to do with any of this? Well, exercise-- and that is both a combination of resistance training and cardiovascular exercise-- is going to improve the health of the mitochondria-- in particular, cardiovascular exercise. And I realize that for you fitness experts out there, any time someone says "cardio," people kind of roll their eyes, like, what is that? There's endurance training. There's interval training. There's HIIT training. There's sprints. There's all sorts of different things. Some of those overlap. Some of them are separate. Indeed, that's the case. But we can use a general rule of thumb here, which is that, for most people, getting anywhere from 30 and ideally 45 to 60 minutes of exercise per day for six days per week, maybe even seven-- but most people like to take a day off or need to take a complete day off each week-- six to seven days per week is going to be good for mitochondrial health and function. It's also going to impact all the other things, like quality sleep, mood, reducing stress, and so on and so forth. So exercise we can handle pretty quickly by just saying everyone should be doing it. Now, when people are pregnant, they might have to, of course, change the amount of exercise or the type of exercise that they're doing. There are varying opinions on that, but certainly the type of exercise and the amount can vary when people are pregnant. But if you're seeking to conceive, getting enough exercise is good because it's good for the mitochondria. The mitochondria are present in that mid region of the sperm. And mitochondria are critical for chromosomal segregation and the spindle and other aspects of the formation of a healthy egg, ovulation, and fertilization in the female. One thing that I know a lot of people are interested in nowadays is so-called intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding. I mean, let's be fair, everybody is restricting their feeding time because hopefully everybody is sleeping at some point in the 24-hour cycle, and nobody is eating while they are sleeping. That said, many people are employing a so-called eight-hour feeding window or a 10-hour feeding window or a 12-hour feeding window. And indeed, there are some data to support the idea that that can be a good thing for a number of different biological and health parameters. However, there are also a lot of data, especially recently, pointing to the fact that your overall number of calories and the quality of your food sources is going to be the most important variable. And some people simply find that time-restricted feeding-- intermittent fasting, as it's also called-- is just a convenient way to ensure that your total intake of calories is not excessive for what you need. Now, with all that said, there is evidence that I've covered in a solo episode and will soon have an expert guest on showing that time-restricted feeding can have certain positive outcomes for various aspects of organ, cellular, and tissue health. This is somewhat controversial, but there is growing evidence that, by restricting your feeding window to, say, 8 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours, that it is better than if you were to eat over a longer period of each 24-hour cycle. But again, the data are still incoming. The reason we want to talk about time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting is that a lot of people do use it because they find it easier to not eat at certain periods of their 24-hour cycle than to restrict calories. But again, keep in mind, you have to restrict calories if your goal is to maintain or lose weight, a discussion that we've covered in that episode on intermittent fasting and in the episode with Dr. Layne Norton and that we will cover in other episodes in the future. So refer to those episodes at hubermanlab.com if you would like to learn more about intermittent fasting, per se. For sake of this conversation, a number of people are probably asking, if I restrict my feeding to a certain window each 24 hours because that's what's convenient or because I'm excited about the potential positive effects of intermittent fasting, is that going to disrupt the likelihood of fertility and thereby a healthy pregnancy? And the short answer to that is, if you are a female and you are having regular menstrual cycles that is a fairly consistent duration-- so maybe it's 21 days, maybe it's 35, or anywhere in between, but it's fairly consistent from month to month-- and you are following intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, well, then chances are pretty good that it's not disrupting your fertility and likelihood of fertilization and a healthy pregnancy. Of course, during pregnancy, you need to talk to your doctor and make sure that you're eating in a way that's supportive both of you and of the developing fetus. That's extremely important. I am not aware of data exploring, in a regimented way, time-restricted feeding during pregnancy. So please, please, please, if you're pregnant, do not jump on a time-restricted feeding, so-called intermittent fasting diet. Talk to your OB/GYN. Talk to your doctor. Talk to multiple doctors, for that matter, before doing anything like that, because, of course, you're now eating for two, or if you have twins in there, you're eating for three. Very important. If, however, you're not yet pregnant and you want to be fertile, get pregnant, or simply maintain a fertile potential and biology and you're following intermittent fasting, it's going to be the regularity of those periods and regularity of cycle length that will tell you whether or not that's a good idea or not. Keeping in mind, of course, that if your total number of calories is too low, your periods will cease. That's a well-known effect. But of course, stress can also induce cessation of menstruation. And there are other factors that can induce cessation of menstruation as well. Some of them start with changes in the brain, literally, in the hypothalamus. Some occur in the pituitary. Many lifestyle factors can do that. But most typically, it's going to be excessive caloric restriction or it's going to be a caloric deficit brought on by excess physical activity. So even if someone's eating a lot, if they're not eating enough to offset their physical activity or they're not eating enough of, in particular, fats, the essential fatty acids and protein, but also carbohydrates, well, then menstruation can cease. And of course, if menstruation is ceasing, chances are, almost with certainty, that you're not getting regular ovulations. Now, in terms of males and whether or not intermittent fasting is going to disrupt spermatogenesis and testosterone production, there's essentially no data we can look to. But we can look to the general logic around the relationship between body fat, testosterone, and spermatogenesis. And this was something that was covered in a discussion I had on optimization of hormone health for males that I had with Dr. Kyle Gillette, who's a medical doctor and obesity specialist. Again, you find that episode at hubermanlab.com if you want to learn all about hormone optimization in males. And essentially, the story is as follows. If a male is excessively overweight, he's carrying too much body fat in particular, not too much muscle-- although that can be an issue too, but too much body fat is typically the issue-- so more than, say, 20% body fat-- well, then losing body fat is going to be the primary goal for maximizing testosterone, sperm health, and spermatogenesis. If, however, a male is already lean, well, then actually increasing calories will increase testosterone. So it's a bit of a complicated story, although not so complicated that none of us can understand it. Basically, if you're overweight, you should focus on losing weight in order to maximize sperm quality and health. If you are very lean, well, then restricting your calories to the point where you are starting to lose weight or you're dropping even more body fat is unlikely to increase your testosterone further. It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad or that you shouldn't try and go, for instance, from 15% to 10% body fat. I'm not saying that that's bad and that will reduce your testosterone. But in general, if you're already very lean-- so 10% body fat, 5% body fat-- and you start restricting calories further, your testosterone levels will drop. So in the context of intermittent fasting, it's really not an issue of whether or not your feeding window is 8 hours or 12 hours. It's really an issue of whether or not you're getting enough calories to offset the physical demands and activities of your life, whether or not you're on a maintenance diet to maintain your weight. And of course, you have to put all that in the context of whether or not you're overweight or lean to begin with. The simple thing to take away from this is, if you're a male who's using-- because you like it-- intermittent fasting, so-called time-restricted feeding, and you're following an eight hour or maybe even a one meal per day type approach-- although I don't really recommend that for a number of reasons we could talk about separately. If you're eating over the course of 8 or 10 or 12 hours per day because that's what works for you and you are ingesting enough calories to maintain your weight if you're already lean or you are ingesting fewer calories than you are burning in order to lose weight because you are already overweight and you want to lose body fat, you're probably optimizing for all the things that you need to do in order to improve sperm quality and testosterone levels. Now, also in that episode that I did with Dr. Kyle Gillette on optimizing hormones for males, we talked about testosterone replacement therapy. It's not a topic I want to get into in any detail right now. But I will say this. Remember earlier when we were talking about spermatogenesis and the fact that in order for sperm to be generated consistently every month ongoing from the time of puberty until essentially the time that a man dies, you need two things. You need testosterone production from the Leydig cells of the testes, and you need spermatogenesis to be supported by that androgen-binding protein coming from the support cells, from the Sertoli cells. So you need testosterone, and you need androgen-binding protein, and you need the Leydig cells and the Sertoli cells active. When men take exogenous, meaning from outside the body, testosterone, either by cream or by patch or by pellets or more typically by injection-- the most typical TRT approach nowadays is testosterone cypionate, which is biologically identical to the kind of testosterone you would make. Well, because of negative feedback loops, which you also learned about earlier, the testicles themselves shut down their own testosterone production. Why would that be? OK, so you're taking testosterone in by syringe or by patch or any other method. So the circulating testosterone and the amount that arrives at the testicle is going to be hopefully clinically appropriate, not super physiological, but it'll be somewhere in the healthy reference range, maybe a little bit higher. Nowadays, some people are going a little bit higher. So we're not talking about full blown, quote, unquote, "anabolic steroid use," keeping in mind, of course, that estrogen is a steroid. Testosterone is a steroid. But when we think about steroids, we mean like performance-enhancing drugs, so super physiological doses. We're talking about within physiological or near physiological ranges. So if someone's taking their testosterone in from an outside, exogenous, source, the levels of circulating testosterone will be sufficiently high that the pituitary will register that and will stop making luteinizing hormone and generally follicle-stimulating hormone, as well. And as a consequence, spermatogenesis is vastly reduced or eliminated. In other words, for men who are on TRT or who are taking testosterone from an external source, the number of sperm that they're going to make is going to be dramatically reduced. There are things that they can do to offset that, like taking hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, which is just kind of a mimic for luteinizing hormone to stimulate the testes to continue to make testosterone. And some men will also-- or instead-- take FSH to stimulate the Sertoli cells to support spermatogenesis-- excuse me-- or both or some combination. Some people take clomiphene, Clomid. There are any number of different ways to bypass or offset the sperm-reducing effects of taking exogenous testosterone. This is a conversation that was covered in a fair amount of detail in that episode with Dr. Gillette. But just keep in mind that if you are taking testosterone from an exogenous source, your sperm counts will dramatically be reduced, unless you do something to offset it. So if you are wishing to conceive, you need to think about whether or not you're going to offset the testosterone replacement therapy or whether or not you're going to come off it entirely. So you'll need to talk to a urologist endocrinologist about that. And again, a number of these different themes and ways to go about tapering off TRT were covered in that episode with Dr. Kyle Gillette. So if you're on TRT or you're considering taking it and you're interested in having children, not just now but at any point, you really want to take these things into consideration. Now, I do want to point out that, for the number of you out there who are taking supplements, some of which we've talked about on this podcast and I've talked about in other podcasts, such as tongkat ali-- it turns out that there are a lot of men and women taking tongkat ali to reduce sex hormone binding globulin levels, to increase testosterone and estrogen, in some cases, libido and so forth. Those approaches, meaning supplement-based approaches, to increase testosterone or free testosterone or some related hormones, are not going to shut down your own endogenous testosterone production and reduce the number of sperm that you make or, at least as far as we know, disrupt ovulation in any kind of way, provided that the dosages are within normal ranges. Again, supplementation to support your hormones should not disrupt ovulation or spermatogenesis or testosterone production. Quite the opposite. It should enhance it. What I just described around TRT as taking exogenous testosterone, that itself is an entirely different beast. Now, with all of that said, there are some supplements out there that include testosterone as a ingredient that's been snuck in to various formulas that include blends and things of that sort. You want to be aware of that. And we did an episode about how to develop a rational guide to supplementation. I highly recommend listening to that episode. Again, it's timestamped, available free at hubermanlab.com in all formats. Because it talks about which supplements are likely to be "clean," quote, unquote, to contain the things that you expect them to contain, there's more and more evidence coming out that a lot of supplements, including some-- for instance, supplements that contain testicle or the extracts of testicles can contain testosterone. Whether or not they can shut down your own endogenous testosterone production isn't clear. No one's really explored that in detail. But based on everything we just talked about with TRT, it stands to reason that it might either reduce it or shut it down. It's just never been explored yet. So by all means, make sure that what you're taking if you're taking supplements. But again, the major point here is that, for both females and males, taking supplements to support healthy hormone production, including things like tongkat ali, is not the same as taking hormones or bioidentical hormones, which indeed can shut down your own endogenous production of hormones and thereby reduce both egg quality and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy and sperm quality and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy. Any time there's a discussion about fertility and pregnancy, there seems to also be a parallel discussion about sex determination. That is, what factors can influence whether or not the child that's born is male or female. That is, whether or not it has double X chromosomes-- so one X chromosome from mom, one X chromosome from dad because the egg was fertilized by a sperm that had an X sex chromosome, that 23rd chromosome-- or whether or not the offspring is male, whether or not it has the X chromosome from mom, because it's always going to be the X chromosome in that egg, and a Y chromosome from the sperm that fertilized that particular egg. Now, of course, there are instances out there of people that have XXY chromosomes or XYY chromosomes. But the vast majority of people out there are going to have either an XX chromosome-- so we call that a female karyotype. This is different than genotype and phenotype, but a female karyotype would be XX-- or a male karyotype, which would be XY. Now, despite the fact that it is the egg and the sperm and the chromosomes that they carry that are going to determine the chromosomes, there's a lot of lore and discussion about the factors that can bias which sperm will fertilize the egg and thereby whether or not you're going to get an XX, female, or an XY, male, chromosome and therefore offspring. Now, not only is the lore around this whole issue of sex determination rather prominent, but it is also somewhat unusual and perhaps even interesting. So for instance, Aristotle himself proposed that if a man is thinking about himself and his own pleasure more than his partner and her pleasure at the point of ejaculation, then the offspring will be male. Aristotle also asserted that if a man is thinking more about his partner and her pleasure at the point in which he ejaculates, well, then the offspring would be female. And of course, we have zero reason to believe that there's any truth to Aristotle's theory. There are no data to support that. In fact, I'm not even sure how you would run that experiment because you can't really look at people's thoughts. You'd have to rely on honest self-report. And even if people were to faithfully report what they were thinking about at the moment of ejaculation, this would involve, of course, bringing people into the laboratory and somehow measuring or analyzing their thoughts or gathering their thoughts during the sexual intercourse at the point of ejaculation, then figuring out which biological sex was the offspring, et cetera. Just near impossible and probably not the most important experiment to invest our time doing. Nonetheless, there continues to be a lot of lore about what determines the sex of the offspring. Most notably, there's a lot of lore and discussion and rumor about the idea that particular sexual positions at the point of ejaculation during intercourse can somehow bias the likelihood that a pregnancy will be either resulting in male or female offspring. Now, again, there are zero data to support this, and yet this whole notion of sex determination is a really interesting one that people seem to be somewhat obsessed by, so much so that, again, if you go online or if you were to talk to people in the sort of let's call it holistic or peripheral health spaces related to fertility, there is discussion about, OK, well, you take this sexual position at the point of ejaculation to get a boy and you take that sexual position at the point of ejaculation to get a girl or you do this in the early part of the day or the later part of the day. Again, all for which there is zero data to support any kind of systematic relationship between what I just discussed and the biological sex of the offspring. That said, there are now emerging methods that people are using in order to separate out the sperm that will indeed give rise to a male offspring versus a female offspring. Now, this, of course, is done in the context of in-vitro fertilization. We haven't talked too much about in-vitro fertilization. But in-vitro fertilization involves, as the name suggests, taking an egg and taking a sperm, pairing them in a dish. This can be done a number of different ways. But just to briefly describe the IVF procedure, IVF involves administering supra-- meaning greater than normal-- supraphysiological levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase of a woman's cycle. What that causes is the maturation of not just one egg that would be ovulated but multiple follicles and eggs. And then ovulation itself is suppressed also through the administration of exogenous hormones. And then, under ultrasound guidance, an OB/GYN goes in and collects the mature eggs and follicles, puts them in a dish, and then sperm are delivered to that dish, and those could either be sperm that were frozen previously, or more typically or ideally, it would be live sperm collected that day that are washed through a very straightforward procedure. And then those sperm either are allowed to compete for those eggs and fertilize those eggs and allow them to advance to very early embryo stage before those embryos are frozen and eventually implanted into a woman in order to have them be carried to full term, ideally. Or there's a procedure in which specific sperm are selected because they have the best morphology, motility, and so forth. And in a process called ICSI, I-C-S-I, in which the sperm themselves are literally forced to fertilize that particular egg. Now, under those conditions, typically a couple or a woman, if she's doing this on her own with a sperm donor, will get multiple fertilized embryos that are carried to a multicellular stage so that it's clear that they could grow into a child if they were implanted into a viable host-- sometimes the surrogate, sometimes the woman who wants the child herself. And under those conditions, it is possible to look at the genetic makeup, including the karyotype, of those early nascent embryos, in which case people really can select the sex of their offspring. That is, they will have some embryos that are XX, some embryos that are XY. It's very likely, also, that they will have some embryos that have karyotypes or genotypes which are not ideal in that they would potentially lead to a miscarriage or some other genetic defect. And so, typically, people do not select to implant those embryos if they have the option to implant embryos that are of either XX or XY karyotype and the normal chromosomal arrangements for obvious reasons. So the whole point here is that sex selection is possible, but only using in-vitro fertilization. The other thing that is becoming clear to us in more recent years is that sex selection is actually possible at the level of the sperm even prior to fertilization. This is an emerging data set, and this is largely happening in clinics outside of the United States. But there are some clinics that have figured out methods in which they can take a sperm sample and they can spin that sperm sample in a centrifuge at a rate that separates out the sperm into what are called different fractions. So for those of you who've done a little bit of biology with centrifuge, it's when you spin any kind of substance that includes multiple things in it of different weights. When you spin them, the things of different weights segregate out into different fractions along the depth of the tube. And then you can take out one fraction or the next simply with a little pipette. You take out the top fraction, the middle fraction, and so forth. And what these clinics have figured out is that if they spin the sperm sample at the correct spin rate that the sperm that will give rise to male offspring and the sperm that will give rise to female offspring segregate out into different fractions, allowing them to take each of those fractions separately and to apply them to eggs, if it's in-vitro fertilization, and give rise very reliably, certainly much more than chance, to either male or female embryos. They also, of course, can choose to do this outside the context of in-vitro fertilization. So some people are now opting to have their sperm samples spun out in this way, separate out the sperm that give rise to male or female offspring, and then to only use the fraction that they are interested in-- so if they want a boy, they'll use one fraction. If they want a girl, they'll use different fraction-- and then to use those fractions in the context of what's called IUI, or intrauterine insemination, which is, as the name suggests, rather than having the man deliver the ejaculate with his penis and the sperm with his penis, they have a device. The devices are now commercially sold. Believe it or not, they're sold over-the-counter and on the internet, so people will even do this at home. And so what they're doing is they'll take the sperm, and they'll do IUI in order to bias the probability that they're going to get a male or a female offspring. Again, this is something that's now emerging. It's not commonplace. Most of the time, people simply roll the dice, as it were, by having either intercourse and just hoping for or not caring if they get a male or a female offspring or, in the instance of IVF, selecting male or female offspring, sometimes largely on the basis of the chromosomal arrangements. So of course, some people might prefer to have one or the other biological sex as their offspring. But of course, the healthy chromosomal arrangements are going to be paramount for getting a healthy child. And as I mentioned before, unhealthy chromosomal arrangements or abnormal chromosomal arrangements often lead to miscarriage and/or birth defects. So selecting for healthy chromosomal arrangements is always paramount, but some people are selecting for biological sex. And indeed, some couples who can conceive naturally are opting for IUI in order to be able to select biological sex because of this ability to spin out the sperm samples to different fractions and select the male or female sperm. That is, the sperm that would give rise to a male or female offspring. So this is a rapidly emerging theme, believe it or not. Who knew? And of course, it has nothing to do with Aristotle's assertions about what people are thinking about at the point of ejaculation, nor does it have anything to do with body position at the point of ejaculation. But I do find it rather interesting that, even in this day and age, people seem to be continually pursuing new and different ways to understand why one sperm or another sperm happens to fertilize the egg. And when that information is not available, because, frankly, it's not available yet-- we don't know why a sperm containing a Y chromosome or a sperm containing an X chromosome is more likely to fertilize an egg. And there are some ideas, for instance, that older fathers tend to have more daughters as opposed to sons. But when you really look at the data, it's pretty mixed. So if you've heard that before, it has a particular nickname that I'm not going to describe on the podcast. You can look it up online. But if any of you are aware of any other kind of ideals or lore, no matter how ridiculous or crazy, please put them in the comment section on YouTube. I'd be very curious to learn about those, mostly out of interest and curiosity. But, look, sometimes these outrageous stories, such as notions of body position and how they influence biological sex, even though they turn out not to be true, turn out to be interesting for other reasons. And in fact, next, we're going to talk about how body position during sexual intercourse can, in fact, influence fertility and pregnancy. So another common theme around fertility and pregnancy that you'll hear about is that, for couples that are trying to get pregnant, that during intercourse they should do whatever it is that works for them, but then after the man ejaculates that the woman should try and position her ankles above her head or somehow otherwise tilt her pelvis back in order to increase the rate and/or probability that the sperm swim toward the egg, as opposed to the other direction. Now, I talked to a couple of different OB/GYNs and urologists that are focused on fertility about this topic, and it turns out you get pretty mixed answers as to whether or not there's any validity to this idea that the woman's body position after the man ejaculates inside of her can somehow influence the probability of pregnancy. One group of experts told me that there is no reason for a woman to need to continue to lie down, elevate the ankles, or in any way tilt her pelvis back in order to increase the probability of successful fertilization. The other group suggested that indeed there is a strong reason to believe that tilting the pelvis back, maybe even keeping the ankles elevated, and having a woman lie on her back for about 15 minutes with the pelvis positioned at about 20 degrees back is ideal for optimizing fertilization. I mean, they were really specific about the recommendations. So I find this interesting that, within the cohort of extremely well trained MDs, OB/GYNs and urology fertility docs, and OB/GYNs, you see a split. It has nothing to do with whether or not the physician was male or female or their training or their institution, none of that. There just seemed to be a sort of even split between the two. Now, granted, it wasn't the largest sample size that I could have obtained. And yet I do find it interesting that there's this split in the opinion about this. One group, the group that said, no, pelvic position doesn't really matter, don't worry about it, it's not going to influence the rates of fertilization, argued that the sperm swim very quickly and that if they are released near the cervix they're going to swim very quickly toward the egg in order to fertilize it regardless of pelvic position. The other group said, well, yes, sperm swim quickly and even if they're released right at the entry to the cervix that the sperm still have a long distance to go. Again, if you were to scale this according to the size of the sperm versus the size of a human body, an entire human body, what you'd scale it to is the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco. And it needs to undergo that basically within 24 hours or so. Although, as we mentioned earlier, sperm can survive quite a while inside of the woman's body-- maybe three or five days at least. So in both cases they acknowledge it's a long distance. But on the one hand, you have a group of experts that are saying the sperm more or less know what to do and are going to do it regardless of the position of the woman after ejaculation inside her and the other group saying, no, we want to do everything we can to bias the likelihood that the sperm will fertilize the egg. Well, setting aside the basic argument that tilting back at the pelvis and lying stationary or so for about 15 minutes after sexual intercourse and ejaculation is not an expensive endeavor, although it requires a little bit of time. And it forces people to remain motionless or close to motionless, and they're not up and around and moving about. Aside from that, it's a relatively low investment. So one argument is, well, if it could bias the likelihood of fertilization at all and people want to get pregnant, why wouldn't they do that? So that's a reasonable argument. But it doesn't really point to the mechanism. The arguments that point to a potential mechanism are that-- if you recall what we were talking about when we talked about sperm quality, sperm quality involves a bunch of different measures, like concentration of sperm per milliliter of semen, morphology of those sperm, how many are forward motile. It turns out that in any one ejaculate sample, the total number of forward motile and yet fast forward motile sperm that are also of the highest quality morphology is actually quite low. And so the idea here is that you want to get as many sperm of the highest quality swimming toward the egg because those sperm stand the highest probability of fertilizing that egg. And in fact, this relates to some of the discussion we were having earlier about behavioral dos and don'ts for sake of increasing the probability of fertilization. And the one that is most important here is cannabis. It turns out that the data on cannabis really do support the idea that some of you may have heard from parents and teachers-- I don't know, I did hear this from parents and teachers-- that cannabis can disrupt the swimming styles of sperm in ways that are not supportive of fertilization, that it can turn more of the sperm into twitchers. Although when I learned about this, I was not informed of the word "twitchers." What I was told is that, if you use cannabis, that the sperm don't know which direction to go, that they're confused, almost implying that the sperm themselves are high on cannabis. Well, that's certainly not the argument that I'm making here. But it does seem to be the case that people who use cannabis, even once, the sperm that are generated during that particular month or two months during which or after which they use cannabis have less forward motility and possibly altered morphology, as well. I want to be very clear, I did not say that if you use cannabis once you are forever disrupting the motility and morphology of your sperm. I did not say that. What I said is that if you use cannabis once, then the sperm that are generated in the 60 days after that cannabis use are going to have a higher incidence of disrupted motility and perhaps morphology as well. Remember, sperm are continually generated every 60 days or so. And so if you use cannabis once, you are not forever disrupting your sperm. But if you are using cannabis and then you are looking to conceive in the next 60 days, you are going to be reducing, we think significantly so, the number of quality forwardly motile sperm. So the simple takeaway from this is avoid cannabis use. Although if you are going to use cannabis-- and again, there are medical uses of cannabis and beneficial uses of cannabis for certain populations. It can be bad for other populations. We talked about that in the Huberman Lab podcast all about cannabis. But if you're going to use cannabis, you should try and abstain from cannabis in the two months prior to the attempt to fertilize and get pregnant. Now, I'm not aware of any data on how cannabis use by the woman can influence the likelihood of fertilization and pregnancy. And I want to couch this whole discussion around cannabis under the umbrella of something that came up in the episode that I did on cannabis, which is that, for about half of people out there, male and female-- so here we're not distinguishing by biological sex. About half of people that use cannabis report it as an aphrodisiac. It makes them want to have sexual intercourse more than if they don't use cannabis. And for the other half, it actually has the opposite effect by way of an influence on a hormone called prolactin, which suppresses the dopamine system, the testosterone, and the estrogenic system. And so this whole idea that cannabis is an aphrodisiac seems to be true for about half of the human population and not for the other half of the human population. So I mention that because I know a number of people use cannabis as an aphrodisiac. They like to use cannabis before intercourse. It was actually very surprising to me to discover when I researched that cannabis episode that approximately 15% of women who are pregnant continue to use cannabis during pregnancy. And that's a very alarming statistic. And everything we know is that the use of cannabis during pregnancy is detrimental to the health and particularly the brain development of the fetus. So that's a real concern. I highly recommend women abstain from cannabis use during pregnancy. Talk to your OB/GYN about it if you're using it all or considering using at all. So based on what I told you earlier about the fact that cannabis use is not good for egg quality and the fact that cannabis use can disrupt the motility of sperm and therefore is not good for sperm quality and it can disrupt the patterns of swimming in sperm in ways that reduce the likelihood of fertility, I think the take-home message is clear, which is that whether or not you want to be a cannabis user or not, if you are going to try and conceive and certainly while you're pregnant, you're going to want to avoid the use of cannabis. And that is smoked cannabis and vaped cannabis. And during pregnancy, the consumption of cannabis even in edible form or in tincture form is also going to be detrimental to the developing fetus. But of course, we started this conversation in the context of body position, in particular at the point of ejaculation, in determining the sex of the offspring and/or the likelihood of getting a successful fertilization in pregnancy. And I think that given that the tilting back of the pelvis-- so again, this is elevating the pelvis by about 20 degrees-- I don't think it has to be exact, exact-- but about 20 degrees for about 15 minutes post-ejaculation inside of the woman-- or I suppose if people are using IUI, intrauterine insemination. Since that seems to be the consensus among those experts that believe that pelvic tilt backward can be beneficial for increasing the probability of fertilization and given that it involves no cost but a little bit of time seems to me that, if you want to get pregnant, that that would be the right thing to do. And as far as I know, there's no information nor was I able to obtain any recommendations from experts about what the ideal body position of the male is after ejaculation if the goal is to increase the probability of fertilization in pregnancy. So we've been talking about behavioral interventions, some dos and some don'ts that people can do to increase their fertility, and the likelihood that any fertilized egg will be carried to term successfully. And soon we'll also talk about things that people can take to improve their fertility. Now, keep in mind that this entire discussion is about fertility. But also remember, as we discussed at the beginning of the episode, trying to increase your fertility is one of the best ways to think about trying to create and maintain optimal physical health. So for people that are trying to conceive and for people who are not trying to conceive, optimizing your fertility status, whether or not you're male or female, is one of the best ways to target those approaches. And there are now a lot of data supporting the idea that acupuncture of all things can be very beneficial for improving both female and male fertility and, should a woman get pregnant, for improving the quality of outcomes-- that is, the likelihood that there will be a successful pregnancy that is carried to term, not premature, and so on and so forth. Now, for some of you out there, you might think, oh, of course, acupuncture, acupuncture has been known to work for thousands of years. And therefore, it's not surprising that it would assist with fertility and pregnancy. For many of you out there, however, probably thinking, acupuncture, that seems kind of like fringe science. But what I can assure you is that there are now quite a few clinical trials funded by government agencies, like the National Institutes of Health, showing that acupuncture is a very effective treatment for a number of different things, including fertility and pregnancy, but for hormone status, for stress relief, even for chronic illnesses of different kinds, including autoimmune illnesses. So this is no longer considered fringe science. In fact, one of the best laboratories in the world working on this is a laboratory out of Harvard Medical School run by a guy named Qiufu Fu. Qiufu's lab has really been exploring in a mechanistic way how the different stimulation sites that are used in acupuncture-- so where the needles are inserted-- tap into neural pathways that link the different organs of the body. So for instance, they've found that stimulation of a particular site on the lower limb can reduce inflammation dramatically throughout the body by way of neural pathways that originate in the lower limb and extend to areas such as the kidney and the pancreas. So all these, quote, unquote, "ancient maps" of the human body as they relate to acupuncture are now being parsed at the level of mechanism, which I think is wonderful because it not only is showing us that so much of what has been purported and reported in the landscape of acupuncture actually has an underlying mechanistic basis, and with additional mechanistic understanding, of course, always arrive new and better practices. That's the idea, to evolve these fields of acupuncture, to evolve the fields of mechanistic understanding of our biology and health. And so the issue of whether or not acupuncture can assist in getting pregnant and in carrying a child to term and for that child to be healthy are really starting to emerge in a major way. And rather than go into all those data in detail, what I can tell you is that there are clinical trials and data supporting the fact that female fertility itself can be supported by acupuncture through several mechanisms, one of which is the balancing-- and I realize that's a somewhat tricky term, and I'll define it better in a moment-- the balancing of hormones across the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, including regulating levels of FSH so that they're not too high nor too low and restricting the FSH to the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, as well as using acupuncture to improve things like blood flow and the health of the ovary itself and other aspects of the female reproductive axis. So acupuncture can operate at the chemical level, impacting hormones. It can act at the mechanical level, impacting the different tissues through which the egg has to pass and so on and so forth. Likewise, on the male side, acupuncture has been shown to improve semen volume, quality of sperm, sperm motility, et cetera, and in large part through changes in the neural pathways that innervate the very tissues and vascular input to the scrotum and testicles, because, as we learned earlier, temperature regulation of the scrotum and testicles is so vital for getting healthy sperm and increasing sperm quality. In addition, there are good data to support the idea that acupuncture can increase levels of testosterone, free testosterone, and the sorts of hormones that are going to support healthy hormone production and sperm production in males. And this is distinct from applying testosterone from an exogenous source. So when we're talking about acupuncture and increasing levels of testosterone, we're talking about increasing levels of endogenous testosterone. So those Leydig cells can support the Sertoli cells, and the Sertoli cells can make that androgen-binding protein, and you get enhanced spermatogenesis. You can find evidence for all of these different features, both changes to the chemical milieu-- that is, the hormones-- and changes to the mechanical milieu, including, for instance, improvement of the pathways leading from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis to the vas deferens, basically clearing out the plumbing so that more quality ejaculate can be delivered, which, of course, is going to increase the probability of fertilization. So when you hear that acupuncture can improve the likelihood of pregnancy, that's an accurate statement for which there are now increasing amounts of mechanistic data. If you want to learn more about how acupuncture can be used to contribute to improved fertilization and pregnancy, there are a number of different excellent reviews on this, both as it relates to females and as it relates to males. One of the best papers that I happen to like is one that we'll provide a link to in the references entitled "Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine for Female Fertility, An Overview of Systematic Review," so a review of reviews. This was published recently in 2021. We'll provide a link to that. And there's also going to be a link to a review that relates to acupuncture for male fertility and hormone augmentation. I should just mention briefly that if you're going to look at scientific papers, one thing that you'll want to consider is also looking at the references that they reference. Now, of course, papers tend to reference a ton of references, in particular in reviews. So what you'll want to do is look for the references that are showing up most often in the introduction. Those references often are going to be the most prominent recent reviews or the most important findings in recent years. That's not always the case, but that's often the case. So if you read the first couple of paragraphs of these papers-- and these are openly available as full text, by the way, online if you go to these links-- you'll be able to access the best papers, the most relevant papers, in the context of acupuncture supporting female and acupuncture supporting male fertility and hormone status. Now, I'd like to discuss things that both men and women can take in order to maximize their fertility. And again and again, when we're talking about fertility, we're talking about people who want to conceive and have children, but also we're talking about a basic measure of overall health status. So if you're somebody who does not want to conceive children, I still encourage you to think about whether or not you would want to do certain things or not do certain things in order to maximize your fertility as a means to maximize your vitality and longevity, because that's really what maximizing fertility is about for a lot of people. That said, I know a lot of people would like to conceive children, perhaps not right away but in the future. And what I'm about to describe are some tools and interventions that is things that one can take in order to improve their hormone status but also, in particular, the quality of their eggs and the quality of their sperm in the short and long term. The first on the list of things that people can take in order to improve egg quality or sperm quality is L-carnitine. L-carnitine is present in various foods, in particular in red meats. But again, it's going to be very hard to get sufficient levels of L-carnitine to improve egg quality and sperm quality, the unless you're going to take it in supplement form. The typical recommendation, based on peer-reviewed studies that have shown significant improvements in egg quality-- that is chromosomal arrangements, that is the likelihood of fertility-- or pregnancy, rather-- the likelihood of sperm being forward fast swimmers as opposed to twitchers or immotile and having proper morphology-- all those measures has been demonstrated to be significantly improved by the ingestion of L-carnitine. How much L-carnitine? Well, that depends on how you're obtaining the L-carnitine. If you're obtaining it in capsule form, 1 to 3 grams per day of capsule form L-carnitine is what's been suggested to improve egg quality and sperm quality. Now, 1 to 3 grams per day can be taken all at once or spread out throughout the 24-hour cycle. It can be taken with or without food. It does not seem to matter. And when taken for a period of 30 to 60 days, it does seem to significantly improve all the parameters that have been discussed for egg quality and sperm quality. Now, the mechanism for that effect is pretty clear. L-carnitine is involved in the processing of lipids, fats, in terms of mitochondrial function. And as we talked about before, mitochondria are vital for the organization and action of the spindle that pulls apart the chromosomes, taking that cell within the female from diploid to haploid, which is essential. You really want just the 23 individual chromosomal strands. You don't want chromosomal repeats. It's also involved in the actual fusion of the egg as it exits the ovary and enters the ovulation cycle. Mitochondria are also important, as we talked about before, for the forward motility of sperm because of the enrichment of mitochondria in that mid region just behind the head. They cause the whipping flagellation of the tail, allowing for forward movement, as well as other aspects of cellular morphology. So it makes a lot of sense as to why L-carnitine supplementation would be beneficial. Again, it's 1 to 3 grams per day over a period of about 30 to 60 months. If you're hoping to conceive in the upcoming months, recommend taking it for at least 30 days prior to that. Of course, based on the data we talked about before-- cumulative probability, fecundability, et cetera-- there's no reason to not continue to try for pregnancy before taking L-carnitine, but L-carnitine is going to improve egg and sperm quality. And so you might actually take the stance that, even if you don't have any problem getting pregnant, wouldn't you want to maximize the quality of the egg that gets fertilized and the quality of the sperm that fertilizes that egg? So that's additional rationale for taking L-carnitine. One important note-- if you are going to take L-carnitine in oral form, in capsule form, it can increase something called TMAO. TMAO can cause stiffening of the arteries. You don't want TMAO levels to go too high. One way to offset the increases in TMAO caused by oral L-carnitine is to take 600 milligrams of garlic per day. I suppose you could eat cloves of garlic. That would work just as well because garlic contains something called allicin, which can offset the increase in TMAO. But 600 milligram capsules of garlic are going to be-- or garlic extract, rather-- is going to be the most probably cost effective and simplest way to do this. And also, they are going to create that garlic smell. Some people like the smell of garlic. Some people don't. So if you're going to take oral L-carnitine, I suggest also taking 600 milligrams a day of garlic extract. And you can do that at any time throughout the day. It doesn't have to be with the L-carnitine. The next item on the list of compounds that have been shown to improve egg quality and sperm quality-- and quite robustly so-- is coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is something that you can actually measure levels of in your blood. Most physicians will say that they want to see your levels of coenzyme Q10 to be somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5. It's going to depend on the units. Most people, I realize, are not going to run off and get their CoQ10 measured. It's not included in most standard blood tests. But if you were to measure your CoQ10, that's the range that you want to look for. That said, many people opt to supplement with CoQ10. And you'll find that many fertility docs, OB/GYNs, and urologists that are trying to assist their male patients with fertility will suggest CoQ10 because, again, it supports the health of mitochondria. Mitochondria are so vital to so many aspects of the formation and fertilization of the egg and sperm that, of course, fertilizes the egg. The coenzyme Q10 dosages that are most often suggested and that you'll observe in the peer-reviewed research literature-- on humans, I should add-- is 100 to 400 milligrams per day. And the coenzyme Q10 is taken generally with a meal and ideally a meal that contains fat. And there's even some idea that taking coenzyme Q10 with your dinner, assuming that dinner includes some fat-- you don't have to add additional fat-- is going to be more advantageous than taking coenzyme Q10 early in the day, although that's probably a detail that's getting a little too far down in the weeds. So again, 100 to 400 milligrams of coenzyme Q10 per day, whether or not you're a man or a woman, for improving the likelihood of fertility by way of improving egg and sperm quality. And again, if you're somebody who just doesn't have any problem getting pregnant or if you're already producing many sperm of quality morphology, this is another case in which you could take a step back and say, well, why wouldn't I want to further optimize the quality of the egg and the sperm, because the quality of the egg and the sperm ultimately are going to determine not just whether or not you have a successful pregnancy but are going to determine, admittedly in ways that will forever remain cryptic to you-- but nonetheless are going to be important in determining the qualities of the brain tissue and body tissue of your offspring. The third item on the list of compounds which are commonly suggested or prescribed by fertility docs nowadays for men and women wishing to conceive and/or optimize their fertility as a basis for general vitality and health is inositol. Now, inositol has many uses. So you'll hear about the use of inositol for reducing anxiety or improving mood or even for the treatment of depression. We talked about inositol in previous episodes of this podcast. For instance, I talked about inositol and in particular taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol prior to sleep, which is something that I do, along with the other supplements that I take and recommend for sleep, such as magnesium 3 and 8, apigenin, and theanine. If you're curious about those, you can see our newsletter on sleep or our "Perfect Your Sleep" episode or the "Master Your Sleep" episode. It talks about behavioral and supplementation-based tools for improving sleep. But myo-inositol is not just suggested for or prescribed for people that are wishing to get pregnant and for general health. But myo-inositol is often recommended for people that want to improve egg and sperm quality because of the way that it can positively impact insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity might sound like a bad thing to people out there. But it turns out that you want to be insulin sensitive. The last thing you want is to be insulin insensitive. Insulin insensitivity is associated with type 2 diabetes, with obesity, and even for people who are not challenged with obesity, you want your cells to be insulin sensitive. You don't want a lot of insulin floating around in your system with your cells unable to use that insulin. That's really what insulin insensitivity is about. Myo-inositol, at dosages of 1 to 5 grams per day-- that's pretty high, 1 to 5 grams per day, keeping in mind that 1,000 milligrams is 1 gram-- has been suggested to improve egg quality and sperm quality. Now, one point of-- I wouldn't say caution-- but of note is that myo-inositol can reduce anxiety, and it can be a slight sedative, which is why some folks, including myself, take almost a gram, 900 milligrams, prior to sleep. If you're going to take 5 grams of myo-inositol, you would want to restrict that to the late evening or second half of your day. And I don't suggest starting that high. I would start with 1 or 2 grams and then working your way up, seeing what you can tolerate in terms of the level of anti-anxiety and drowsiness that it produces. 1 to 5 grams per day of myo-inositol is what's suggested for both men and women wishing to improve egg health and sperm health. But for women, it's also often suggested to include also-- so to take myo-inositol, but to also take D-chiro inositol. D-chiro inositol has elements in it that can be both pro and anti-androgenic. Androgens are things like testosterone and related molecules. There are a number of different causes of infertility and disruption to egg quality, age being the most significant factor. But another significant and very common factor, even among young women who are of fertile age, is having too many androgens and as it relates to something called polycystic ovarian syndrome. We'll do an entire episode about menopause and PCOS and a number of other things that relate to fertility because it's an entire and very interesting other discussion that we need to have. But the recommendation is that women take 1 to 5 grams of myo-inositol but also D-chiro inositol because of the ways that it can balance androgens and offset some of the negative effects of polycystic ovarian syndrome or even for women who do not have polycystic ovarian syndrome because of the ways that D-chiro inositol can balance androgens in ways that are beneficial. The dosages of D-chiro inositol that are recommended tend to be 1/25 to 1/40 of the myo-inositol dose. So you'll have to get out your calculator. Remember, 1,000 milligrams equals 1 gram. So figure out, if you're taking 1 gram of myo-inositol per day or 2 grams, you're going to want to convert that to milligrams. So let's say you're taking 2 grams of myo-inositol per day. That's 2,000 milligrams. Then you'd want to divide that by 25. And that's how many milligrams of D-chiro inositol you would want to take, as well. Or you could go with the lower end dose and divide it by 40 and take that number of milligrams of D-chiro inositol along with the inositol. Again, probably taking it later in the day is going to be good. And it's not clear at all that taking it with food or without food makes any difference whatsoever. So I would suggest you do either. Keep in mind, as I'm discussing these recommendations, I may call them prescriptions. But none of these are prescription drugs. And of course, you should always discuss any supplements that you're planning to take or stop taking, for that matter, with your physician. I don't say that to protect me. I say that to protect you. Any time you're going to add or change something in your overall health regimen, you want to discuss that with your trusted health care professional, typically, I would hope, a board-certified MD. The fourth item in the list of commonly suggested supplements for men and women wishing to optimize egg and sperm quality, respectively, is omega-3 fatty acids. And now, here, we're talking about something that could be obtained from food and can be obtained from food. So if you're consuming fatty ocean fish, things like sardines, anchovies, salmon with the skin, chances are you're going to get some quality omega-3s. Omega-3s are also available in plant-based sources. It's also available in krill, for that matter. But most people find it difficult to reach the threshold required for optimizing mental health and physical health that is the threshold of the EPA essential fatty acids. And so for that matter, I've suggested before on this podcast-- and many fertility docs will suggest-- that their patients take omega-3 fatty acids in supplement form. It could be taken in liquid form or in capsule form, but enough of those that you're getting at least 1 gram per day of the EPA form of omega-3, so at least 1 gram per day and as high as 2 or even 3 grams per day of the EPA form. So you'll need to look at the packaging because oftentimes it'll say high potency omega-3. It'll say 1,500 milligrams of omega-3s. But that's not 1,500 milligrams of the EPA form. You look on the back of the label, and it'll say, each serving contains 750 milligrams of EPA. You want to get above that 1 gram dosage per day and as high as 3 grams per day of the EPAs. The most cost-effective way to do that is going to be liquid-form omegas, but that's a little bit inconvenient for many people, and some people don't like the taste. That's why they rely on the capsule-form omegas. And of course, there are compounds that can impact fertility status, quality of eggs, quality of sperm, not by adjusting mitochondria or insulin sensitivity or creating a general milieu of support for the egg and the sperm production and function, such as the compounds that I just listed off do, but rather compounds that influence the hormones involved in the generation of sperm and the generation of the eggs, involved in the ovulatory cycle and the spermatogenesis cycle, that is. Now, these are going to come in different forms. And I want to just emphasize that the supplements that do this, that adjust hormones in these ways that can be beneficial, are distinct from hormone therapy or bioidentical hormones, distinct from hormone therapy or bioidentical hormones, because, as we discussed earlier, when you take a hormone like testosterone or even estrogen, for that matter, from an exogenous, an outside source, you're going to disrupt the feedback pathways inside of your body, and you're going to shut down your own endogenous production. The supplements I'm about to describe do not do that and yet can adjust levels of hormones in more subtle ways that can be beneficial for the process of maximizing fertility for males and for females. The first of which on this list that I'd like to discuss has been discussed in previous podcasts as well, which is a substance called tongkat ali. Tongkat ali also goes by other names. But when taken at 400 milligrams per day, sometimes separated into two dosages but typically taken as once a day early in the day because they can be a little bit stimulating, although not anxiety provoking-- I've never heard of that. It can be a little bit stimulating. But 400 milligrams a day of tongkat ali has been shown to increase free testosterone by way of reducing something called sex hormone binding globulin. It's also been shown to increase luteinizing hormone, the net effect of which has been described as a subtle but significant increase in libido and some of the other parameters associated with increased androgens, like free testosterone in males and females. So a number of people out there are taking tongkat ali in this way-- 400 milligrams per day, restricted to the early part of the day, with or without food. People always ask, do you need to cycle tongkat ali? I'm not aware of any need to cycle tongkat ali. In fact, it tends to work better, meaning the effects on libido and some other hormone profiles tend to increase over time. Again, tongkat ali is an option. Certainly, none of these things are requirements. We're simply listing off options. But many people, both males and females, seem to benefit from and like tongkat ali, even if they're not seeking to conceive. There's no reason to think that tongkat ali directly improves sperm quality. Except in males, the increase in androgen created by tongkat ali supplementation can indeed lead to improved spermatogenesis. So there's a growing amount of data in the research literature on tongkat ali. Many people find it beneficial. And so it's something that both men and women wishing to conceive and/or optimize their fertility just as a general health parameter might want to explore. The other supplement that's been shown to improve both egg quality and sperm quality-- and there I'm referring to a number of different parameters related to egg quality and sperm quality-- as well as to increase libido fairly substantially is a substance called Shilajit. Shilajit, spelled S-H-I-L-A-G-I-T-- Shilajit is actually a compound that's used in ayurvedic medicine, but there are some really good research studies exploring the supplementation with Shilajit at about 250 milligrams twice per day. And this has been looked at in males and in females. And it does seem to significantly increase two hormones. One is testosterone, and the other is follicle-stimulating hormone. And for that reason, Shilajit is often considered a tonic that people use both as an aphrodisiac to increase libido as well as to increase fertility. Now, one note of caution, if you're a woman and you're considering taking Shilajit in order to increase testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone, keep in mind that the ovulatory cycle is this very tightly regulated cycle in which you want low but elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone early in the follicular phase, then it peaks right before ovulation, and then low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone in the second half of your cycle. For that reason, using Shilajit chronically around the entire course of your ovulatory cycle could be a little bit risky, and I'd recommend that you talk to your OB/GYN prior to doing that or if doing that at all. For males, it's a little bit less of an issue, because, as I mentioned earlier, sperm are constantly being generated, and the presence of FSH is going to increase spermatogenesis. Now, Shilajit is not FSH itself. Shilajit stimulates the release of FSH. And it stimulates the release of testosterone. So again, there's no reason to think that it would shut down your endogenous testosterone or FSH production. Although there are limited amount of data that really explore that in detail. Many people use Shilajit in order to increase their testosterone, FSH, their libido, and various aspects of sperm health. Again, the dosages of Shilajit are about 250 milligrams, two times per day. One issue with Shilajit is it often comes as a tar, which is a little hard to measure out the dosages. Yes, a tar. It's this kind of thick, gummy substance that you're supposed to dissolve in water. And the recommendations are you take a little bead and dissolve it in water. It is available in capsule form where the ability to control the dosage is made a little bit easier. But of course, as with any supplement, I recommend starting with the lowest possible dosage. So you might want to start with a very small bead of Shilajit dissolved in water, taken once per day, and then increase the dosage as needed in order to obtain the effects that you want. Things like Shilajit start to bring us into the realm of what can only be described as a little bit unwieldy, right? Here we're saying you can't really control the dosage. Now you're talking about hormones that need to be tightly regulated, at least for females across the ovarian cycle. For males, yes, it has been shown to increase testosterone and FSH, improve sperm motility and sperm count pretty significantly. No reason to think that you couldn't do that chronically with Shilajit. And yet, I do want to acknowledge that Shilajit, as this black tar substance, contains a lot of different things. In fact, it comes from a mineral pitch. What is that? It comes from literally the dirt and plants that have been compressed by rocks in the Himalayas. So that's pretty esoteric stuff when it really comes down to it. But the biological effects of Shilajit, in both males and females, seem to be related to the fact that it is highly enriched in something called folic acid, and folic acid is involved in a lot of different cellular processes, not the least of which, at least in this context, is the transport of molecules across cell membranes. And for hormones to have their effect, they need to cross cell membranes on the outside and the inside of the cell. So maybe that's how it's having its effect. Again, the mechanisms of exactly how Shilajit increases testosterone and FSH and thereby libido, egg quality, and sperm quality aren't entirely clear. But for the more adventurous of you out there who want to experiment with Shilajit, whether or not you're trying to conceive or not, it might be something to consider. But of course, do talk to your physician. The next compound that I want to discuss is zinc. And this discussion mainly pertains to males, although I, of course, should point out that females should get the recommended daily allowance of zinc each day. Males, on the other hand, seem to benefit from having additionally high levels of zinc intake. Now, that can be obtained through foods. You often hear, oh, oysters are enriched in zinc, and oysters are an aphrodisiac. I don't know who's doing the marketing for oysters, but it's really terrific. I think that seems to have persisted. And maybe it's true. Oysters are enriched in zinc. What does zinc do for fertility? Well, in males, we know, based on a really nice set of studies, that zinc dosages that are pretty high of about 120 milligrams taken twice per day-- that's quite a lot-- with meals can significantly increase testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. And this probably shouldn't come as a surprise to us. It turns out that zinc is highly enriched in human testes and in the testes of other animals, including fish and other mammals. And it was actually in 1921 that it was observed in fish that zinc levels skyrocket in the testes of fish during their breeding season. So zinc is correlated with increases in breeding, but you never know which direction that correlation is running. It turns out that zinc in both animals, including fish, other mammals, and in humans, strongly impacts the enzymatic functions in the testes, including the function of androgen-binding protein. So it seems that high levels of zinc can increase spermatogenesis and testosterone levels very significantly. This was explored in a really nice study that I'll provide a reference to. It's an older study. But I really like. It's called "Effect of Zinc Administration on Plasma Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, and Sperm Count." This is but just one study among many now. This dates back to 1981, but there have been studies subsequently that point to the fact that supplementation with zinc at those high levels can really be helpful in terms of increasing sperm count, testosterone, and even testicular size, of all things. So one important point about taking zinc-- this 120 milligrams of zinc two times daily definitely needs to be done with meals. If you've ever taken zinc on an empty stomach, even if you just take 15 or 30 milligrams of zinc, you can feel very nauseous, not well, for a few hours. So make sure that you're taking zinc with full meals. So this would mean that you're taking in at least two full meals per day. I should also mention that zinc supplementation did not appear to impact gonadotropin-releasing hormone or prolactin. So it seems to be a fairly targeted effect on the testosterone and related pathways in males. As far as I know, there have not been systematic explorations of the effects of high levels of zinc administration on females. I would hope that those studies would soon be done. But meanwhile, if you're a male and you're interested in improving sperm quality and your testosterone levels overall for whatever reason, zinc likely is a good candidate. And that pretty much summarizes the compounds that men and women should take in order to maximize egg quality, sperm quality, and fertility. And then, of course, we start to enter the landscape of other things that men and women can take in order to improve fertility, and those other things generally are prescription drugs. And so I just want to mention what a few of those are. But of course, these are things that you would absolutely have to obtain prescriptions for from your MD, and your MD, without question, would want to take blood tests prior to prescribing these things. So for instance, if men have been taking exogenous testosterone through the use of anabolic steroids, like performance-enhancing drugs or even testosterone replacement therapy, their endogenous testosterone levels are going to be very low, and their sperm counts are going to be very low, unless, for instance, they are prescribed and taking something like hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, which mimics LH and would stimulate the testes to produce testosterone and through some indirect pathways rescue spermatogenesis, although not to the same degree as if people are not taking exogenous sources of testosterone. Some men, even if they've never touched TRT or exogenous testosterone of any kind, will be prescribed to take hCG because of its ability to stimulate the testes to produce more testosterone and sperm. So they're just taking hCG alone. Other men will take-- or will be prescribed, rather-- FSH in order to stimulate spermatogenesis, or hCG and FSH, or clomiphene, which can regulate all sorts of things in the both testosterone and estrogen-related pathways at the level of brain and pituitary and gonad, testes. Likewise, for women, if they're low in FSH, they might be prescribed FSH. If they are low in luteinizing hormone, they might be prescribed hCG. If they're low in testosterone, they might even be prescribed testosterone. And if their testosterone is too high and they're dealing with PCOS, they might be prescribed anti-androgens and androgen blockers and on and on and on. There are so many different hormones that can impact the different aspects of the ovulatory and the spermatogenesis cycle that the OB/GYNs and the urologists focused on male fertility nowadays really have an excellent handle on which levers and buttons and threads to pull and push and so forth in order to set in motion a proper ovulatory cycle and a proper spermatogenesis cycle. Everything we talked about up until now and in the early phase of this episode, especially, about how the brain commands the pituitary and the pituitary commands the gonads and then the gonads, the ovary, or the testes send feedback signals to the pituitary to then influence the pituitary, all of that incredible orchestra, that dance, is so tightly regulated in a way that really provides the OB/GYNs and the fertility docs concerned with male fertility exceptional tools to, for instance, figure out if a man is not producing any sperm but his testosterone levels are well within normal range, well, then there are some very clear sets of explorations and potential treatments. Some of which are mechanical, making sure the epididymis and vas deferens are clear, allowing the sperm to enter the ejaculate and the ejaculate to enter the urethra and obviously to enter the female, as well as for a woman who's not ovulating to adjust her levels of FSH or maybe even to apply acupuncture in conjunction with supplementation and various prescription hormone therapies to adjust fertility and ovulation and the probability of successful pregnancy. So there's a vast landscape of prescription drugs and surgical interventions of varying degrees of invasiveness. And some are, for instance, outpatient procedures. Some require general anesthesia, et cetera, in order to maximize male and female fertility. What I've tried to do today is to provide you with a deep dive understanding of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle. We talked about the brain, the pituitary, the ovary, the Fallopian tubes, and, in fact, the whole female reproductive axis as it relates to fertility and reproduction I also describe the male reproductive axis as it relates to the brain, the pituitary, the gonad, the testes, and the various ducts, the pathways, out of the testes that allow the sperm to be enriched within the semen and then the semen and the ejaculate to exit through the urethra. I did all that as a way to frame the various tools and interventions that can really assist in increasing fertility, egg quality, and sperm quality. So when we discuss mitochondria in the context of the development of an egg or the development of sperm and its ability to swim quickly forward, now it should make sense as to why give an intervention, whether or not it's L-carnitine or whether or not it's exercise or whether or not it's getting enough sleep and limiting stress, why all that should matter and why, in fact, mechanistically those interventions can work. Because, indeed, there are many interventions that we can all do and use to support our fertility. And again, as a more general theme today, I really wanted to, A, teach you about the human reproductive axis-- I do find the biology of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle and spermatogenesis to be absolutely fascinating to me. And again, if you're somebody who's interested in conceiving or if you've already conceived children and even if you don't want more children, this is really the aspect of our biology that allowed us to be here. It's the aspect of our biology that determined whether or not we are male or female. It's the aspect of our biology that determines so, so much, and yet I think that most of us generally are not taught this in school or at least not at the depth that we discussed it today. So hopefully that information was in and of itself interesting and perhaps useful as well. And I do think that even if people are not wishing to conceive more children that the information related to fertility and optimizing egg and sperm health is of value in the sense that optimizing egg and sperm health can be used as a proxy for optimizing our body and brain health generally. In other words-- and here I'm admittedly taking words out of the mouths of the various wonderful doctors, the OB/GYNs and neurologists that helped inform me in anticipation of this episode-- what is good for the woman is good for the egg and for fertility and for pregnancy. And what's good for the man is good for the quality and production of sperm and for fertility and pregnancy. Put differently, whether or not we are male or female, the things that we can do to optimize our fertility are the exact same things that we should all be doing to optimize our vitality and our longevity. And I realize today's episode was so much the deep dive and fairly broad, as well, that it ended up being fairly long and extensive. And yet we still have not touched on any of the important themes that I know a number of people want to know about-- so, for instance, menopause, andropause, PCOS, and other themes related to hormones and reproductive function and biology. And I promise that we will have episodes, both solo episodes and episodes with expert guests, in the future to cover all of those topics in detail. Meanwhile, the information discussed in today's episode should serve as a basic foundation for those discussions going forward and hopefully were of interest to you in their own right.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in a series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. Across this six episode series, Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercisers and teaches us the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that I mentioned a moment ago, ranging from strength to endurance, hypertrophy, and everything in between. We get really far into details, but at all times paying attention to the macroscopic issues. That is, how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed, or one that combines all of those. We also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations. During today's episode, Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness and, more generally, how to think about fitness so that we can best achieve our fitness exercise and performance goals. Dr. Professor Andy Galpin. Super excited to have you here. You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however-- so many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that; they're overtraining, they're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask how fit are we, with the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, could encompass endurance, certainly it does, strength, the ability to run fast, even if for short distances, it might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy, trying to balance one's musculature to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, et cetera. How should I, or anyone else for that matter think about their level of fitness? I know my resting heart rate, but what do I do in terms of really assessing whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be both for sake of health and performance? And here I'm asking you the question not as an athlete, but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exerciser. But if we were to throw our arms around this question of how do we assess our fitness, what would be the different levels of assessment that we should think about and do? ANDY GALPIN: When it comes to exercise, people generally have two major goals in mind. Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance. Right? This is I want to be big, or I want to not be too big, or I want to be lean. Something, right? It doesn't matter what that goal is, but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody. They want to look a certain way or not look a certain way. The other one is functionality. So I want to be able to perform a certain way. Now, again, that definition differs per person. So I want to be better at strength, I want to be better at mobility, I want to be able to have energy throughout the day, whatever it is. So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic and there's some sort of appeal to functionality. So within both of those categories, we want to be in a position where we can understand, where do I need to go with my exercise training so that I can be as fit and as healthy and achieve these goals that I want now, as well as be in a position where I can maintain them for a long period of time. So this blends both immediate goals. So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weights. Say you're interested in running a 5K time the best run. It doesn't matter. It blends that with the desire to have a long wellness span, to be fit throughout life, to achieve all those things for as long as possible. So then the question kind of comes back to saying, well, how do I know which area I need to focus on the most, and why am I not achieving these goals, or how can I get there more effectively. And if we look at the big picture, we have to understand that there are several major components to physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories. And to achieve that, there are a handful of components that have to happen to be able to hit those goals. Now there are infinite methods. So the saying we actually use here a lot is, the methods are many, but the concepts are few. So what I'd love to do today is, over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then cover a whole bunch of different methods. And we could do that for hours. But we'll cover a number of them for various goals. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience and not into exercise science is because of this thing neuroplasticity, the nervous system's ability to adapt. But the more time I spend with you and the more I learn from you, I realize that many, if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt. And when we're talking about physical exercise, there are incredible adaptations that, of course, involve the nervous system, but also involve muscle and connective tissue and so many other cell types and tissues. That said, when we talk about fitness, what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness? And later, I know we're going to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations, but what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise? ANDY GALPIN: There are many reasons why one should exercise, and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats. But the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas. So the very first one is what I call skill or technique. So just learning to move better, more efficiently with a specific position and timing and sequence, or whatever that is. This could be running more effectively, this could be practicing a skill like shooting a ball or an implement, swinging a golf club. Anything like that, I call that skill development. The second one is speed, so this is simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration. That's very similar to the next one, which is power. And power is speed multiplied by force. The next one then, of course, on top of that, is force or strength. So those are really synonymous terms. How effectively can you move something? Now, this is often confused-- strength, rather-- as muscular endurance. So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker of what's the maximum thing you can move or what's the maximum amount of force you can produce one time. It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do. That's actually another one of our adaptations called muscular endurance. So that is typically under the order of say five to 25, maybe 50 repetitions. Think of a classic how many push-ups can you do in a row? How many sit-ups can you do in a minute? Things like that are muscular endurance. Muscular endurance tends to be localized, so this is specific to just, say, your triceps and your deltoids. It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker or anything like that. So that's strength, number four. Number five is muscle hypertrophy. And this is the first time now we're talking about an appearance rather than a functional outcome. So moving better, moving faster, and moving heavier are indicators of how well you can move. This is the first one that's just simply how big is your muscle? And that's muscle hypertrophy or muscle size. After that is muscular endurance. So this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement. So think of how many push ups in a row you can do, how many sit ups in a minute you can do, things that are typically in five to 50 repetition sort of range. And it is often or it is almost always local muscle. So what I mean by that is a push-up test is really how many reps that your triceps and pecs and deltoids can do. It is not a cardiovascular endurance. It is not a global physiological endurance. It's specific to, typically, one or a few muscle groups at a time. And this is why you have to do multiple tests for every group there. After that, now we've moved into number seven, which is what I call anaerobic capacity. This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate. And now we're actually looking at, rather than a single movement or muscle group, it is a total physiological limitation. So it is the maximum amount of work you can do in, say, 30 to 45 seconds, maybe even up to 120 seconds, of all-out work. Think of your classic interval type of stuff here. So how much work can you do at a maximum rate, where you're going to enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue? The next past that is maximal aerobic capacity. And this is probably actually something like in the eight to 15 minute range, where you're going to reach probably both a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO2 max, which we'll talk a lot more about what that is later. So that is different from the previous one, where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds. It simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position to where your VO2 max is actually going to be sufficiently challenged or an indicator there. And then the last one, number nine, is what I call long duration. And this is just your ability to sustain submaximum work for a long period of time with no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. This is often called steady state training or a lot of people just think of this when they think of, quote, unquote, "cardio," but your ability to continue to move without any breaks or change or drop is the last and final adaptation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for long distance steady state, I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes because-- ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so. What sort of rate ranges are we talking about in terms of this long duration? ANDY GALPIN: Well, that's actually wonderful. You're going to be anything past 15 minutes. So really, if you look at a minimal number there, it's generally 20 minutes of what we're looking for, but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes. But anything past that would still be limited by your long-duration endurance, so your ability to sustain work over time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So given that there are nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types, is there any one global test or assessment that people can take or do that allows them to determine what level of ability, of fitness they have in each and every one of these nine different categories? ANDY GALPIN: There are probably dozens or more tests that you can do for each one of those nine categories. And what I would actually like to do is walk you through my favorites for each and giving you both the scientific gold standard-- so if you have the ability, unlimited resources, what should you go do? As well as some that are equipment-free, that are cost-free, things that anyone can do across the world. In addition to that, I want to walk you through what those numbers should be, how do you identify if you're really poor in something or if you're great. And then if you aren't as good, maybe, in a category and you want to get better at it, exactly what to do in terms of protocols for how to achieve optimal results in each of those steps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I noticed in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health-promoting benefits, which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise. Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those? ANDY GALPIN: Absolutely. It's because those things are actually not specific training styles. They are byproducts of these nine. So what I mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs, which we can certainly talk about, you'll realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not. General health is the same thing. When we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective, then the rationale for what to train for is going to determine itself. So what I mean is, looking at things like, in order to be healthy, you have to have sufficient strength, you have to have cardiovascular fitness, and you have to have sufficient muscle and et cetera. Therefore, training for one's health is determined by those restrictions. So for you, Andrew, you may need to do more strength training to be healthy, where me, because I'm strong already, way stronger than you, I may not need to do as much strength training. So our, quote, unquote, "health-based protocols" are based on our current status or limitations in physical fitness among these nine areas. So what I would like to do today is to cover a brief history of exercise science. And the reason is it's going to explain a lot about why people are not getting the goals in their exercise programs that they want as well as gives you very specific direction about what to do instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I can't wait to hear all the things that I'm doing incorrectly and to have you help me remedy that. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentous. Momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single-ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single-ingredient formulations. With single-ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally. And this is, of course, important because we realize that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab podcast, in particular supplements, for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery, you can go to livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S-. So that's livemomentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolytes sodium, magnesium, and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best, but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells, and nerve cells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake, but what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and, in particular, if you're following a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods, which, of course, is a good thing, chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. LMNT contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams-- that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink LMNT-- that's drinklmnt.com/huberman to get a free LMNT sample pack. With your purchase.

Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity. I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, and slow-wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature, that is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of core body temperature. And waking up involves a one to three degree increase in core body temperature. With Eight Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature in the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning, each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman and check out their pod three cover and save $150 at checkout.

Before we get into how the history of exercise science informs the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes, I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite one or two studies that point to a naturally occurring example of how people can become very fit in one area and not another. I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance but, at least to my eye, don't look like they are particularly strong. I'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very, very strong, particularly on social media, but that don't look like they could walk up a flight of stairs, much less run a mile. Do you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: There's a lot to discuss here, but I'll answer really clear. If you look across the literature-- and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s. In fact, it actually goes back previous to that, to the Harvard Fatigue Lab, 1927 to 1947 area. People actually were advocating, at that point, a combination of strength training and endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In the 1920s? ANDY GALPIN: Way back then. In fact, it actually goes prior to that. In the late 1880s, there is scientific evidence back then. It became more well-developed in the mid 1950s and '60s. In fact, there was the initial stages of what's called the Exercise As Medicine Movement, which is the movement now, but the initial stages of that actually route back to the 1950s. And I could actually go into that whole discussion and the story of how that all came about, but that's the Health Is Wealth mantra that came from the 1950s, from the scientific community then. All those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance. Now, if you have a specific goal five months from now, you want to compete in a race or hit a certain physique thing, that's fine to focus on one area of training. Certainly, if you're an athlete, that's different. But if you want to maximize health and overall functionality throughout time, it needs to be a combination. And to really, really highlight this, I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done. One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden. So I did this at the Karolinska Institute, which you probably are aware of. It's actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology. Generally, it started there. It was called something different back then, but really, our entire field came out of Stockholm and the Karolinska Institute. And we worked with a whole bunch of cross-country skiers that were in their 80s and 90s. And so they were competitive skiers in the 1940s and '50s, and they had been skiing competitively for that entire duration. So you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing. So these are 80 to 90-year-olds, living alone and healthy. And we compared them to a group of individuals here in America who are the same age but were not exercising. And what we wanted to do is to see and of look at, what are these lifelong endurance individuals? What do they look like? And when we brought them into the lab, which is, by the way, amazing, to do a VO2 max test on a 92-year-old, especially in a language that they don't speak, you can imagine, you're doing this in the hospital. And you're running people through, this is a cycling task. And so for a VO2 max test, you have a mask on your face, you're hooked up to a metabolic cart so we can collect all the gases that are coming out of your mouth, and you're chanting these people on. And basically, every minute, the workload gets harder and harder and harder until you can't complete it. And we're doing this in a cardiology center, and the cardiologists are usually waiting for their heart rate to get slightly elevated and they stop them because they're 85, 86 years old. And not only are we not stopping them, but we are screaming in their ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In Swedish or English? ANDY GALPIN: In English. And then the translator-- but it doesn't take a lot of translation when someone's screaming at your face, go, go, go. So we ran them through a whole bunch of VO2 max tests. And we did the same thing for those folks back here in America. And what was incredibly clear from that study was the VO2 max-- you can think about these numbers, and this is what's called relative. And the relative terms are milliliters per kilogram per minute. And so a standard number is about 18, is what we call the line of independence. So if your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute, it's very hard for you to live by yourself. So your fitness is so low, you probably are going to need to have somebody living with you or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home. So if you are in a VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22, you're not below that line of independence, but you're on that threshold. And so what we found was our folks here in America, the group average was right around that number. So they were living at home, by definition. We picked them to be people living by themselves in their 80s and not in a living home, but they didn't have any bandwidth. So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness, they were going to drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sort of assisted living situation. The folks in Stockholm, the cross-country skiers, the group average was much closer to 35 to 38 milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, that number is about the VO2 max you would find for a normal college male. And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90-- the joke, if a sabertooth tiger ran in the room or whatever and it chased it down and we all had to run to see who didn't get eaten alive, the college men would probably have gotten eaten before the 90-year-olds. And in one case, we had a 92-year-old individual. And I think his VO2 max was 38, which was, in our estimation, a world record, the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May I ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody very fit, like these older Swedish cross-country skiers? If somebody has-- let's say their number is 35 millimeters per kilogram in this VO2 max test, but since most of us don't have access to that kind of equipment, but we can measure our pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What was a typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. I mean, typically that's a good number to go off of for anybody, regardless of age. Any time I see somebody above that, I'm going to start asking questions. Certainly above-- you'll see in the literature people will say 60 to 80 is normal, and I don't agree with that at all. If your resting heart rate is 75 beats per minute, there's either something going on or you're not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How much cross-country skiing were they doing, on average, in the previous, let's say, if we take the previous 20 years since they'd been longtime cross-country skiers. Divide that by 20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: On average, are these people cross-country skiing five hours a day, two hours a day, an hour a day? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, that's actually a good question. I don't remember. It's been many years, but they were not doing it every single day. And the volume would not have shocked you. It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there. Now, obviously, these people were, again, world champions and Olympic gold medalists in the 1940s and '50s, so they were elite. They just continued consistently over time, but it wasn't a shocking amount of physical fitness. They also didn't go out of their way to train hard. They were busy chopping wood. They were busy doing a number of other things. And then they just happened to do some of these races and ski along the way, but it wasn't a crazy amount too where you're like, oh, that's great, but I could never hit that number. It was something much more reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So is the takeaway to be consistent about getting cardiovascular exercise? And we can define what "consistent" means in terms of days per week a little bit later, and I know we will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What are some other examples? I love these examples from the real world. ANDY GALPIN: So here's the downside, though. So I only told you about the VO2 max. What I didn't tell you about is their leg strength and functionality. And that part was no more superior than it was their counterparts who were not exercisers. So what that showed really, really clearly-- and many other studies have been done since then that look at the classic, what we call lifelong endurance exercisers. You will see, in general, their VO2 max, their cardiovascular function, their resting heart rate, their blood pressure. It will be markedly healthier than folks who don't exercise. It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic disease management, no doubt about it. However, it is not sufficient for overall global health because it does almost nothing for leg strength, for any other marker of health, which we can talk about, what are the things that are actually going to predict mortality, morbidity than most. So was a big smashing indication that's like, hey, this is great. However, you're leaving things on the table for your overall health. Now, one could argue, they're 80, and they're doing pretty well, but they weren't doing as well in these areas. And so a study we did later, actually, as a follow-up was looking at monozygous twins. So this is actually interesting. Being a scientist, this is a classic example of one of my graduate students who had been in my lab for probably three or four years. And she was in our single fiber physiology lab. And you can imagine, she's isolating individual muscle fibers, from an athlete, one by one with a tweezer. And she's going to do several thousand individual cells. So you're down there for hours, and things happen down there. You kind of lose your mind. And she was going on one day with one of my colleagues and just talking, and she's like, oh yeah, my uncle is really, really fit and something or other and then. Oh yeah, he's a twin. And I was like, oh, is he a monozygous? And she's like, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For those that don't know, monozygous are identical twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, which is interesting. So you basically have-- what I'm setting up here is this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical twins mean they have the exact same DNA. So an egg was fertilized, split, and then two humans grew out of that with the exact same DNA. And so now we can start answering the question, well, yeah, OK. What about, maybe, these cross-country skiers? Maybe they were just genetic freaks. Maybe it didn't matter. It's like some people have-- well, genetics are always a component to it, but how much? Well, now we have a scenario lining up where it's like, wait a minute. You have monozygous twins. So we have a replica of a human being, exact same DNA. The only differences that we would see in their physiology now would be due to lifestyle circumstances. Interesting. So monozygous twin dad and uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. Do they exercise? Well, one of them does. He's a lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman, all these things. What about the other one? Nope. He doesn't exercise at all. And at that point, I wanted to kill my graduate student because I'm like, you've been in my lab for three years or more, probably, and you've never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create. And Jesus, the look on her face when my colleague and I were staring at her. She's just like, oh my god. So I'm like, call them right now. They are coming into the lab. Fly them in from Chicago. I don't care what we have to do. We're getting them in. And so I wanted to-- actually, going back to the model that was first developed by the Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing that's interesting about that community is they started off with the concept of trying to examine human performance through a holistic lens. And so it was the antithesis of looking at either organ by organ, so we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system. We're only going to look at skeletal muscle. And then we're saying, we're looking at this entire picture. And so that model, we wanted to carry through in these twins. And I said, all right, I want to bring them in the lab, but I'm not just going to look at one system. I want to do everything. So we took stool samples. We took blood. We did vertical jump tests. We did maximum strength tests. We did MRIs of muscle mass. We did VO2 max tests. We did efficiency stuff. We did genetic testing. We did an IQ test. We did psychological battery. We wanted to look at everything to figure out of these things, what differ between the twins? And if so, the second key question there is, by how much? So can I improve my VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, but how much? Can it change by 5%, 80%? Where is the number? And so putting some quantification on this was very important. And so again, we had another example of a classic endurance-only training paradigm compared to a non. So this is a person who's, I think, he's truck driver by vocation. I think, actually, he drove for a potato chip company, which was even funnier. The endurance athlete actually was great because, like any endurance people, he had physical books of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years. And we just went through them, and we calculated the total amount of miles he ran, his averages, his heart rates per time. We had this unbelievable thing, what races he was in. He had the documentation. He was just totally nuts, something that endurance people are like shaking their head right now going, oh, yeah. I got that too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And endurance folks are pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right? So it was great because now we could validate, as close as one could, to actually how much you ran and things like that. So they had about a 35-year discord. They both exercised up through high school. About 18, they stopped doing it, and by the time I got them in the lab, they're in their mid-50s. So it was about 35 years of difference. And when we ran them through the testing, if you look at the measures that were similar to the Sweden study, it was almost identical. The exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. Any of those markers, as predicted, were much better. What was very interesting, though, was the things that were in the middle. First of all, their total amount of muscle mass was almost identical, to the gram, within the margin of error of a DEXA scan could possibly ever be. The non-exerciser, though, was a little bit fatter. So the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat or non-lean tissue, really, same sort of deal. So OK. No one's surprised there that the exerciser was a little bit leaner, even though it didn't change total amount of muscle mass at all. When we looked at some of the more functional tests and we looked at things like muscle quality-- so this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound. You can kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue, which is sometimes an advantage for an endurance athlete to have a little bit more of what are called intramuscular triglycerides because it's a fuel directly in the tissue. But in general, the muscle quality he was not in favor of the exerciser. If you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength, it favored the non-exerciser. And so now, again, we have the same finding we saw in our Sweden study, but in identical twins. And so it really, really highlighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimal health, simply picking one silo is not going to get you there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition? Not that that's a vital thing to be able to do, but just in terms of measuring strength, it's our isometric strength. Was the non-exercising twin stronger or at least as strong as their exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN: Yes, particularly in grip strength. Yeah. And any of the measures like the vertical jump, leg extension power, and a number of things, they often favored the non-exerciser, which you're still a little bit of a chicken and egg. You don't know if, necessarily, the endurance training reduced that other twin's strength. It doesn't even really matter, per se. I think the highlight of it is, can you change some of these metrics of VO2 max? Yeah, not even close. These things are very responsive regardless of your genetics. Your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly. Even the non-exerciser was a pretty healthy guy. So they were in a good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really pay attention to his diet at all, and he was in a pretty good shape. However, if you want to actually move progress and move forward high functionality, you have to do something besides just run, just distance run. Now, I could say the same thing for strength training. That alone-- because I don't want to make this thing like I'm saying endurance exercises. It worked. In both cases, both these studies, those folks were much better off in metrics that are incredibly important to mortality, how long you're going to live, VO2 max, et cetera. It's just not going to get there in terms of strength. We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well, which is very interesting. So what I mean is there's generally two types of muscle fibers, fast-twitch and slow-twitch. And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging is a selective reduction in fast-twitch fibers. And that's because it's difficult to activate them unless you're doing high-force activities. You're going to activate slow-twitch fibers doing almost any activity of daily living. And so they stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless you're doing something of high force or going, not be used. And they're not going to be kept around. And that's a problem because when you look at things like the need for leg strength through aging, the ability to catch yourself from a fall, these things are incredibly important. If you don't have fast-twitch fibers, you don't have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time, and you don't have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening. And so if you look across, again, the aging literature, they're very clear about the importance of maintaining strength and fast-twitch fibers over time. So we know that this is an important distinction here overall. And people will often talk about, how much of that is genetically determined? Can I change my fiber type? And the answer there is resoundingly yes. And can I change it with exercise? And the answer is, absolutely you can. And then the next question is, how much? So now, again, we're going to see an order of magnitude. In general, without going too far down an area that maybe we can save for later, each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage of fast-twitch and slow-twitch, for example, your calf. If you look at your soleus, which is the smaller one that goes in the back, that's generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80% or so slow-twitch. The gastroc, which is the other one right next to it. So if you were to point your toe next to your face and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle pops out, that's your gastroc. That is almost the inverse. So it's generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe 20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural or postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal erectors, things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day, are going to be slow-twitch. And things like your hamstrings, which are for explosion, are going to be fast-twitch. Well, we biopsied the quad in these individuals. And in that muscle, it's generally about 50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, as a really broad number. Well, one of the things that we found was in the non-exerciser, it was almost textbook what you would predict. It was about 50% or so slow-twitch, a little bit of percentage of fast-twitch, and then about 20% or what are these called hybrid fibers, which are a hallmark of an activity. All right. Great. In the exerciser, it was about 95% slow-twitch. And so it's extremely clear-- again, I don't know if maybe their set point was a little bit higher towards that, and the non-exerciser devolved down to his place or the other one, but it doesn't matter. I mean, you're going from 40% slow-twitch in one case to 95% slow-twitch in another case. It shows you that the limits of physiological adaptation are darn near boundless given enough exposure. In this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training, and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin with the exact same DNA. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality. Has the opposite experiment been done or observed, where somebody's just weight lifted or just sprinted for a number of years? I don't know that there's a identical twin control. That's a little-- ANDY GALPIN: No. I wish we had a third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much to ask for. Right, triplets. So triplets out there, if you're exercising in different ways or people who have triplets, maybe you assign one kid to be a runner, one kid to be a weightlifter, and the other one to be sedentary. Please don't do experiments like that. But the expectation, as I understand it, would be that the person that sprints or that does heavy squats, explosive work, would then have more fast-twitch muscle fibers in their quad. And their non-exercising counterpart would have fewer. That would make sense. But what happens if you assess the endurance level in somebody who's just done strength training or just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So we don't have those data specifically. We're actually just starting to have studies come out on lifelong strength trainers. And there's actually a very good reason for this, which is a whole story we can get into, but the quick answer is, we don't have a lot of people who've been lifting weights for 30-plus years. We have a whole swath of people who've been doing endurance training for that long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that because fewer people have been weight training or are the weight trainers all dead? ANDY GALPIN: You've got to go back to 1953, 1954. You had two major things happen that changed the entire course of exercise physiology and exercise science and, really, exercise as we know it. It's important to understand the history of our field. A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and can't do. As an example, questions like momentum. Should I use momentum or that's cheating, right? Or it doesn't work. It compromises my results. It's actually totally untrue. There are excellent reasons when you should use momentum when you lift. There are reasons when you should not. It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercise repetitions. Sometimes very slow and controlled is better. Any question I get-- in fact, I'm very infamous for always responding with, "It depends." The reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal. When you're training for speed or power or muscular endurance, the answer to some of these very common question differs. What people fail to realize is they think they're asking the right question because they don't understand this history, what's being planted in your brain subconsciously, is driving that question. And it's not necessarily the right one. So if we walk through that a little bit, you'll see what that field has led. Why you think certain things matter when they actually don't or maybe your assumptions are incorrect and then exactly what to do about them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic, and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me. Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens, which are critical for recovering from stress, from exercise, from work, or just general life. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d3k2. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim this special offer. ANDY GALPIN: So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile, so subfour-minute mile. And then you also had Sir Edmund Hillary and then his sherpa, Norgay, summit Everest in the same, basically, two-year span. That exact same year after that was the formation of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine. Now, that is still around today. It is the preeminent group for this Exercise As Medicine. So if you're interested in things like exercise for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment, for things like that-- it's not really sports medicine. It's more for clinical exercise-- that's the place to go, American College of Sports Medicine. So we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercise and start swimming and cycling and running. And then you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the Harvard Fatigue Lab. So the fatigue lab actually shut down in 1947. So you have these people interested in physical fitness, but nowhere to go. Well, all those people left the Harvard fatigue. lab and started their own labs at other places. So you've launched the careers of people like Dave Costill and John Holloszy and some of these very famous exercise physiologists. And they start building laboratories. And we start, for the first time ever, studying the science of exercise. So years go by, and these people happen. The 1960s the 1970s is what we call the runner's boom. So people start-- in fact, if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathons, it explodes through these two-decade spans because it's like, we could do these endurance feats. Notice both those feats were endurance, running short term as well as going over there. No one has thought anything about strength training and here's why. In the late 1880s, there was a very famous physician named-- George Winship, I think was his name, who was a big proponent of strength training. Well, he died in the age of 50 something of a heart attack. And that terrified people of strength training for 70 years because they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. That stuff will kill you because he was a doctor, he was trying-- he was running around the country, doing these exhibitions and reporting it, and then he died. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's sort of like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --dying. Although some people say he died of a heart attack. Other people said he fell through the ice into cold water. That's debated, but the fact that a heavy proponent of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not good for business. ANDY GALPIN: So now the little storm is brewing. 1940s-- and I'm going back a little bit, but bear with me for a second-- there's a guy named Peter Karpovich, and he's a scientist out of Springfield, the decorated physical education, PE, that's a legendary place, Springfield College. And he is anti strength training for a lot of the same reasons. In his entire career, he talked about, don't do this. He's the one that launched these ideas that strength training will make you lose flexibility, it will be bad for kids, all these things that we know now are clearly not true. He's a proponent of these things. And there is a show that happened at Springfield College, and a guy named Bob York-- and if you-- York Barbell, that's still around today-- is going around the country and putting on these exhibitions. They come to Springfield, and it's sort of like a new-age social media thing, where it's like, the students know what's about to happen because Karpovich shows up to this event. And everyone knows he hates strength training. And everyone is like waiting for it to end, just to see what he's going to say. So this whole exhibition goes on, and these people are doing-- you've got to remember back at the time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman, it's all the same thing. There's no differentiation yet. And it finishes, and Karpovich stands up, and the crowd goes silent. And he just asks one question. And he just points to one of the guys and says, scratch your back. And now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy to be like, ah and not be able to put his hand behind his head. And I think he pointed to John Grimek, who's a famous bodybuilder. And he reached back and scratched his back, no problem. And then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells-- I think they were 50-pounds dumbbells-- and do a backflip, standing backflip with both in each hand. They started doing the splits on stage, and they start performing all kinds of physical function tests. And Karpovich is stunned. He's like, holy-- he has nothing to say. He leaves there, and his whole life has changed. All these things he was claiming were shown, in his face, to be false. He does a 180 on his career. He starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately there are no detriments to strength training in terms of global health. Of course, you can do it wrong and things like that. And in fact, here comes a whole bunch of benefits. So through the 1950s, while this thing is going on with the endurance folks, no one's still strength training because there's no record to see. There's no American College of Sports Medicine. There's no societies. There's no science. We're not sure it's safe. And meanwhile, Karpovich is just hammering study after study after study showing you it's safe, it's safe, is safe, but it hasn't picked up yet. And then everything changed in 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He came out with the trifold. He hits you with pumping iron, which I know you know that movie, right? Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's an interesting movie. Even for those not interested in bodybuilding, it's a very interesting movie because it really gives a window into not just him, but the way in which weight training started to show up as a regular practice. When I was growing up, the only people who weight trained were people preparing for football, bodybuilders, who basically didn't exist in the town where I grew up. And the only people who did yoga were yogis doing Bikram, but now you drive through any major American city or European city and there is yoga studios, there's gyms with free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible, I think, for initiating that shift. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. Because think about it. He hit us with Pumping Iron, Conan, and then The Terminator, almost in back-to-back-- very close, within years. So you've got this whole cascade of the '70s of people running, cycling, and swimming. Now, science is starting to come out that it's not dangerous and maybe, actually, some benefit. And then boom. Not only is it not bad for you, it can make you into a real world superhero. I mean, think about the psychology of a child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think about what Batman looked like in the 1950s and '60s. And then boom. I can look like that? Now, not everyone wants to look like Arnold, but you see the power that can land in people. No one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transform like that. You could maybe be born like that, but no chance. That's within the grasp of all of you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I was a kid growing up, one of my favorite books was The Guinness Book of World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I still have images in my mind of the coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The longest lifespan, et cetera. And there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger. And you know what his record was? It said, perfectly developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which is, as you point out, that isn't the physique that most people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN: It doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it did inspire this shift. The other thing about resistance training that I think has a certain allure for some people, men and women, is that it's one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle that occurs during the training, the so-called "pump," it gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100% ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you run and you're gasping for air, you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster than you are that day. ANDY GALPIN: That's correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But when you weight train, you get an aesthetic picture into how your functionality and aesthetic will change. It disappears a few hours later-- ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as the so-called "pump" subsides, but it's a very interesting form of exercise in that way. It's almost as if you go in to learn a language and during the process of learning, for brief moments, you're actually fluent, and then it gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have taken off the way that it did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I mean, it's like if you got paid every hour on the hour when you were working. And then at the end of the day, They take the money back, but you still-- as the time clock is going on in your day, you're looking up, and you're watching your bank account grow in real life. You can see why it's so addicting to those folks. So to finish the story here, going back to your actual question answer. This is happening in the late '70s, early '80s. And so now Joe Wieder, all these gyms, they're exploding because people want to look like that or they realize they have the chance to change how they physically look. That had never been a reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mostly men at that point, I'm guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah, for a large number of reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even with endurance stuff, you could get fitter and run faster and that's better, but it wasn't going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat. Now you can change how you look, which is so incredibly addicting. In fact, there's a very famous quote. I think it was actually Joe Wieder who said, "Show me one man who wants to be strong, and I'll show you 10 who want to look strong." It's like, that's very, very powerful. There's this a whole-- there's tons of this history I can go into, which is sort of explaining to you. But now you know you're in the mid- '80s, and you have what I call my generation. So you have my generation, who fall in love with strength training in the 1980s and '90s, but there's really no scientific field for it. It's not really come about yet. The science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along at a massive rate because these people came up in the '70s and '80s, and they're five, 10, 15 years in their career. They're producing. They're generating graduate students. They're starting their own labs. And they exercise physiology, still to this day, is 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost exclusively. Well, now my generation, you love sports. You love lifting. You love all these things. And now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training. Ooh. That's on TV. He's on SportsCenter in the mid 1990s, lifting weights. And we go back, actually, to the late 1970s. And I'm not sure if you're a football fan, but any football fan will recognize the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1970s and '80s changed how football's played. Well, the reason is because they started strength training. And they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Epley, who was the founder of the NFCA. So the National Strength Conditioning Association is formed in the late 1970s as well. So just like ASCM was developed the year after those two events happened, 1978, the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA is formed. And now you have a scientific organization dedicated to strength and conditioning. You've got NFL strength conditioning coaches that are starting to come on board. You've got scientists that are starting to come into labs. And strength conditioning becomes a scientific field. Well, everything swings now, from an exercise perspective, into bodybuilding. And so almost all of the things-- in fact, we were sort of talking before, I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you. And I could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things that you think are absolute standards or guarantees about training. I'm supposed to do this. I'm never supposed to do that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For instance? ANDY GALPIN: For instance, is it OK to train a muscle group on back-to-back days? Most people are at home thinking, no, you're not supposed to train a muscle-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It needs to recover. ANDY GALPIN: And that's total nonsense. Other things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, other things like cardio, endurance training influencing, will it ruin my gains for my lift? All of these things are on at a base of assumptions that come from bodybuilding. Now, that's a fantastic world, but because everything started in the late 1970s as bodybuilding, in terms of-- basically strength training was that. Weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around. They were, but nobody cared. Again, show me someone who wants to be strong. I'll show you 10 who want to look strong. The physique thing just dominated, and we're not getting out of that yet. We're not all the way out of it. We're starting to, though, because here's why. People started to realize, this bodybuilding thing is fantastic. I can change my physique. I'm getting better, but damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, two hours. And I'm going to spend that whole time on one or two body parts, which means I'm going to have to lift six days a week, and I'm going to have to do that consistently. Now all of a sudden, boom. Two hours on my elbow flexors. Damn, my elbow's starting to hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet, my understanding is that it doesn't really require two hours a day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not at all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of training in order to get benefits, even just for hypertrophy. ANDY GALPIN: Totally. But a lot of the times, you're going to have to get some amount of time in because you're spending so much isolation. So we've gone away from training movement, running as a movement, cycling as a movement, training my biceps as a muscle or muscle group, training my hamstrings or a muscle group. That's not a human movement. So we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises from movement-based prescription to now muscle group-based training. So when you're isolating muscle groups, that means a whole chunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day. So what happens if you're doing, say, legs on Monday and you miss Monday because you're on a flight? Now your legs have to wait a whole other week, So this starts to become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing, I actually don't feel that great. I'm not super fit. I'm sweating just walking up the stairs. I'm out of breath. Why? Because all that training, you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness. You've done nothing to improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood flow. And so that paradigm swung way too hard into the exercising, especially lifting weights, is single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff. And that left a giant opening of people going, well, wait a minute. What if you could get in the gym, I can promise you the same or better result in under 30 minutes? And, in fact, you'll also feel better. You'll lose more weight. And that opened up group exercise classes, kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type of stuff, circuit training because you can come in, you won't get so beat up because the volume is lower, the time is much lower. You get multiple adaptations at the same time. Great. The problem with that, though, fast forward 10 years, is it started burying people because you've now de-emphasized movement quality, and you've overemphasized scores. So this is a classic example. If you go and you watch Pumping Iron or any bodybuilder, you'll see if they're doing a bicep curl, they don't even really pay attention to the rep range. They don't really pay attention to the load. They are looking at their muscle. They're trying to figure out, how do I get that thing to fire? They're squeezing. They're flexing. They're posing at the end of every set. They're trying to figure out, am I getting enough pumps? It is exclusively founded on exercise quality. The rep brains, the numbers, almost irrelevant. When you go to the other model, exercise technique, it doesn't matter. Just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps or the fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This would be CrossFit. I've walked past some CrossFit. I've done two CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: I don't want to get sued. So you said "CrossFit." I didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no I enjoyed them. I definitely felt like I was working hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, you will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I observed a lot of people in very close proximity doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping-- that's where you kick your legs, folks, say, sort of like bucking and kipping type pull-ups. No. I enjoyed it. It wasn't for me for the long term, but it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement in close proximity to other people. So the hazard to me seemed more about that than the actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, the point I'm setting up here is, that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced. So it got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements, which are more effective, generally better. It got people doing things fast and explosive. That's more athletic. That is more important for longevity. It solved a lot of the problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. The issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality. They pushed the pace on how many people can be in here at the same time. So now you're doing higher-risk movements, higher intensity, higher fatigue, and with a total-- not that they don't care about technique, but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about. It's getting the number and the thing done. They solved the time issue, though. You can get tremendous results in three days a week, under 45 minutes each session, et cetera. Burn people out, though. Way too much high intensity, way too often. And the other problem, safety concerns, all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question, as we go through this arc of the history of why endurance training predominated or strength training or bodybuilding type training or CrossFit type training because I think this is fascinating, and I know we're about to arrive at where we are today-- ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and what the future looks like for people and what they should focus on and do. At what point, if any, do you think resistance training started to become adopted by women? There was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger there was Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are some impressive physiques, certainly, on female actresses and athletes. The Williams sisters, very impressive musculature and physiques. And, of course, their tennis playing speaks for itself. Has that happened yet? What I mean is, do you think, since you work with both men and women, do you think that most women understand that weight training, done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them, maybe even especially for them, in terms of offsetting bone density loss and things of that sort? Or are we still waiting for the popular stimulus for getting 80% of young women thinking, I want to lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard for me to answer because I'm not a woman. Now, I have a daughter. She's four, so we'll see. What I can say is, I've probably worked with-- I don't know how many professional athletes in total. A lot. I've worked with them probably 14 professional sports. I've worked with Cy Young winners, MVPs, all the credentials. I bet 35%, 40% of the athletes I've worked with are female. So I've worked with Olympic gold medalists. I've worked with bronze medallists in multiple sports. I've worked with the most decorated powerlifter of all time in a number of these areas, fighters, world championship, all of these things. For me, I feel like that burst has already happened. My students, if you look at my classroom, I don't know what the numbers are, but there is no small number of females in exercise science and excess physiology. If you look at our laboratories, that's one thing you will see. There are very few female exercise scientists. There are very few female strength conditioning coaches, but that number is coming down at an astronomical rate. You have people that are being hired in every sport. You pick the NFL. You pick Major League Baseball. Every few months we're hearing, first female hired for this, first female hired for that. The Yankees, Rachel Balkovec is fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's been out to my lab. She's terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fantastic. I mean, she's now being hired as the-- I think she's a hitting coach now, actual sport coach. She's going to be a GM. This is her goal. She's a terminator. So that's already happening. And my students that are coming through our program are getting placed in these roles. They haven't gotten through yet a lot in terms of being an actual scientist, but they're getting there. Sports scientists in the NBA are being hired, females, in terms of big data collection. And sports science and tech, we'll cover in another discussion, but I think it's happening. Whether or not the cultural and social-- I can't speak to that end of the equation. What I can speak to, though, is one of the things I think is most fun coming forward scientifically is a number of years ago, NIH came through with their mandates. They're saying, it's no longer acceptable to exclude women from scientific research because we just did that for decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, what happened-- just to fill this in because I think it's worth noting is that for many years, studies even on rodents were mainly carried out on male rodents because the assumption-- and the assumption turned out to be wrong-- but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents-- because they don't have a menstrual cycle. It's not 28 days. They have an estrus cycle. It's four days, a different type of cycle-- that would somehow disrupt the data. It turns out that's entirely wrong. Now it's actually required. When you sit on a grant study panel, which are the people who evaluate grants, they ask. They literally say, did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable? Here we're not talking about sex as the verb. We're talking about sex as biological sex. And if you don't say yes, that's a strong hit against the grant. And if you say yes, then it checks off that box. So it's now required that both male and female rodents and humans be studied in a given study unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one or the other population-- ANDY GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such as menopause, for instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --menstrual cycle, andropause, for instance. But no, this is extremely important. I'm excited to hear that. ANDY GALPIN: So where I was going to go with that is actually, so that was step one, which is cool. You've got to include them. Where we haven't gotten to yet, but I've seen more and more grant applications come through for this, it's just the funding hasn't it yet, which is, it's one thing to let women be in the same studies. That's great. It's another thing, though, to start performing high-performance research specifically for female questions. That has not happened yet. And that's just a funding issue. We haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. We don't get a lot of financial support for sports science, but we can't track down the money yet of me going, I want to do a study in female athletes that answers female athlete questions. These won't help men. These are questions specific to the female. That's the next step. That's where we've got to get to so we can say, maybe we should do things differently around training or recovery or we shouldn't or it doesn't matter. There's a handful of-- not lower-quality, but some studies. I don't love them yet. There just needs to be a ton of work. Birth control is a very good example the information for women at female athletes or even just hard exercisers-- you don't have to be a competitive athlete-- around what is birth control doing? What types? How should I manage that? What conversations should I be having with my doctor? Almost nothing. Women have nothing to go on for high-performance stuff. So what if I'm trying to compete in an event or run a race? All those types of questions should be answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing. It's just not there on the female. So that's an area. I think-- if somebody really wanted to make a change, the scientists want to do it. I know it. I've talked to so many in our field that would really love to explore it because it's getting there. Like I said, the coaching side is getting there. They're seeing it. They're hiring these people. I'm seeing it in my students. My followings is not all men. It's a very large percentage of females, and all I do is post about exercise science. This is all I do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, this podcast is very-- we know very clearly the audience is 50% women, 50% men-- ANDY GALPIN: That's nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is great. ANDY GALPIN: So just to jump back in our history discussion and to finish that point of where we're at now and where I think we're going to go or should go. So we walked through the bodybuilding running everything and people walking into a gym. Any time they lift weights, they're making all of their choices based on the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the goal. And clearly, that's not the case. There are other adaptations you may be after. So we talked about how that had problems, and then we talked about how some of these other forms of exercise filled those gaps and then what problems those things introduced. Well, I think we're actually at a point where that pendulum is slowly shifting into the middle. What I mean by that is, if you want to maximize muscle strength, we look towards the power lifting community. If you want to maximize muscle power, we're going to look to the weightlifting community. If you want to look for muscular endurance, well-roundedness, maybe we look into the CrossFit communities and some of these obstacle course races or functionality things. So what we can do now is generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we don't want, because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and choose optimal protocols or combinations for them. So if somebody simply wants to get healthy, like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and I mentioned health wasn't one of them, that's because what determines your health versus what determines my optimal health differs. So if I need more hypertrophy, I can look towards bodybuilding concepts, but if I have enough or maybe for personal reasons, I decide I have too much or I don't want to add any more, then I can say, hey, how can I get stronger without getting bigger? And boom, I look towards powerlifting concepts. How can I get more powerful? How can I get faster but I don't, again, want to lose fat? OK, great. Or if I want physique changes. So we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from that have expertise in specific adaptations and develop ourselves perfect protocols based on that information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So with the understanding in mind as to how we all, myself included, arrived at such lopsided fitness, too much endurance, not enough strength, too much strength, not enough endurance, it's really hard to imagine that anyone's perfect in this regard. Can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us a way to assess our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine? ANDY GALPIN: All right. The very first one we want to talk about is movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific. So I'm not going to give you an assessment for optimal golf technique swing. This is really about human movement so that you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible. So what are the minimum requirements? Now, if you can have access to a highly-qualified physical therapist or movement specialist, that's the best route. Go to them. Have them identify all of your movement patterns, overhead pressing, squatting, running, all these things. That's your gold standard. If you want to do it yourself, though, here is a very simple four-step solution. So the way that I teach this is I go joint by joint. And so I think of this as the major ones, your shoulder, your elbow, your low back, hip, knee, and ankle. Now, what you can do is do a representative movement for you. So if you bench a lot, use the bench. If you do pull-ups, use the pull-up. If you squat, do that. I would recommend doing an upper-body press, an upper-body pull, a lower-body press, a lower-body pull. An example would be a push-up, a pull-up, or a bent row, a squat, and then a deadlift. That would be a very, very well-rounded approach. What you're going to do is do that movement. And I would record it for yourself. And record a frontal view and a side view. Probably do three to 10 repetitions per angle, slow and controlled. You don't need any body weight. What you want to do is move, and you want to look for key things at every joint. So again, imagine I'm doing a squat. I'm going to do a squat, and I'm going to focus on just my ankle. And I'm going look for these four things of the ankle. And then I'm going to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things of the knee through the hip, et cetera. So what are these four things? Number one is you want to look for symmetry. So symmetry is front to back, left to right, and your right limb and your left limb. And so what we want to look for are if they aren't moving perfectly, that's fine. But you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one? Is one turning to the side and one's not? Is one fidgeting and twitching around differently? So you want to look just to check, to see and make sure that they're stable. That's one. Number two, you want to look for stability. So a key indicators here are things if you can't get through Squat, a controlled squat, where your knees don't start shaking. That would be an instability issue. So can you do the movement slow? Can you pause at the bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five seconds or 10? You should have complete control of that movement and all of these joints. Are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up? Is one elbow closer to your body when you're benching and the other one's more flared out? These are the things I'm talking about. I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not. You're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities. So again, as you're pushing up, does one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all over the place? The third one is what I call awareness. So there are a lot of movement technique issues that, simply, people don't know. And so you'll watch them squat. I do this in my classes all the time. I'll have 100 kids out there, squatting. And you'll see some horrible squat technique. And then when you just tell them, hey, did you realize your heels are supposed to be on the ground all times when you squat? They're like, oh, OK. And they can correct it. It's not actually a movement flaw. It was just simply an awareness. I didn't know, and then I actually didn't realize that was happening that position. So we want all of our joints to be going through a general full range of motion, which is number four. So the ankle-- during a squat, your knees should be able to go as far over your toe as possible while maintaining good position, your feet flat on the floor, your three points of contact, your whole flat foot, and you're not compromising another joint. So that's all you're going to look for are those four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, and range of motion through each joint, through each movement. It sounds difficult and time-consuming. It's really not. You can generally clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds. And what you're really going to look for-- there's lots of scoring schemes you can test, that physical therapists will sort of do. I just look for absolutely terrible, can't do it at all, minor flaw, or pretty close to good. That's really all I'm looking for. So my scoring system is zero, one, three. Zero is like, you're not going to do this exercise because you're at a very high acute risk. You might get hurt on rep one tomorrow. Number one, a score of one is like, there's a minor flaw here. We can probably do it, but we need to be cautious of load and volume. And the other one is, maybe it's perfect, maybe it's not, but go ahead and it on a reasonable protocol. You'll be fine. So that's generally what you would need to do as a cost-free method of identifying good movement technique within any of the things that you would do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about speed? ANDY GALPIN: I actually don't think this is one most people should test. If you're a high-performance athlete, we can run a 40-yard dash or we can do some different things with a velocity transducer on a barbell, if you're a weightlifter or something. For most people, pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration are the two ways we break it down. It's generally not that necessary to test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about number three, power, which I believe before you told me was speed times force. ANDY GALPIN: So the reason why I don't worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test. And a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people. So the cost-free version here is a simple broad jump. So this is stand with normal position, jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can, and measure the distance between where you started and the back of your heel, where it lands. A super basic number to look for there is your height. So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are. If you're 5' 5," you should hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. It's not perfect. That's going to ratchet down a little bit, about 15%, for females. They just simply don't have the power, in general, that men have. And so you're going to want to bring that down a little bit, but it's a very crude number. If you were to look at a high-performance NFL player, if they're six feet tall, they're going to be jumping nine to 10 to 11 feet. If you can jump your body height-- we're not looking for optimization in this particular test. You are looking for red flags if you can jump your body height, you're going to be just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's incredibly straightforward and yet, I have one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to before I jump, I can swing my arms from back to front as harder, with as much momentum as I can muster. And when I land, you said I'm going to take the measure from where the back of my heels. ANDY GALPIN: You want to measure the distance you actually covered. So to clarify, there's no running approach here. There's no steps into it. You're going to stand at a still. Yeah, you can swing, bounce as much as you'd like to do. You're going to projectile off. So you're going to measure the distance from the tip of your toe-- so basically, stand behind the line and then the furthest point back where you land. So basically, the worst possible score, not the best possible because your feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going to be a little bit farther. Now, technically, if you fall backwards and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number, but in this case, just use the furthest point back over your back heel, and go from there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be trying it tomorrow morning. ANDY GALPIN: Now, if you have access to a little bit more technology or you just really want to know a better number, a classic vertical jump is a good starting place. So you can actually do this in a simple, cost-free way. You can just measure two of your hands. Put them together so that both of your middle fingers are touching. Overlap them, and put them directly over your head. And then you want to reach up as high as you can get. And you mark that on the wall. My brother and I used to do this all the time. We would take a highlighter, the yellow ones, and color as much as we could on our fingertips, touch the wall so that the highlighter would stain the wall-- if you actually go back to my house from my childhood, you'll see these markers all over our house. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm sure your parents were thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: My dad didn't care. Single dad, he didn't care. He's just like, whatever, you guys. Do whatever you want. So you want to measure that. And then, of course, you're going to jump with those two hands and touch as high as you can up. And you're going to measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jumped there. Now, the reason you're doing it two-handed by the way, is because if you do one-handed, you can actually reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders. And now you're getting into differences of who has more shoulder mobility, who has the ability to get up there. A two-handed standard approach is there. Same thing, no running approach here. You can dip. You can drive. You can do all those things. You can swing your arms, but you're going to be a two-handed touch, is a general way to do that. You want to look for a number of something like 24 inches or higher. If you're past the age of 50, that number can come down a little bit, to closer to 20. And again, for females, it's going to be ratcheted down about 15% everywhere you go. If you're a middle-aged female, and you're jumping 20 inches, you're in a pretty good spot. You're going to be looking really nice there. Now, if you can do that on a force plate, that's even better. So these are, basically, scales that will go out to multiple digits, sometimes five to nine digits past zero. And you're going to stand on these things, you're going to do the exact same test. And these are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump, but they'll tell you how much force you put in the ground. They can also tell you how long it took you-- and this is called your rate of force development-- as well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff, which are important to help you understand where on the power spectrum you need to be. So you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell. So a very classic thing to do would be, let's say, you're going to do a squat. And you're going to put this device on the barbell, and that's going to measure the speed at which the barbell moves. And you're going to do that at 40% of your one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, up to 100%. And that allows you to create what's called a force-velocity curve. And you can start to see at what point, when you start loading things heavy, do you start slowing down too much. And that will tell you what part of the force-velocity curve that you want to train in to optimize your power. Why that's important, a lot of people will do things like, when I'm training for power, how heavy should I lift? Well, the general answer people say is, 30% of your one-rep max, but that's actually not true at all. What's most optimal for power development-- which we'll discuss more much later-- is depending on where you're flawed in the force-velocity curve. So if you have access to technology like that, that can give you a lot more insight and information. If not, do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your fingertips and jump it up and touch the wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: At Andy Galpin's house. ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along. The walls are already messed up. Just go ahead and come up to Washington, and we'll do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. What about strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right. So strength is really important. You need to measure this in multiple areas. And we'll start off with grip strength. So you can do this in two ways. You can buy a hand grip dynamometer. Now, these are anywhere between $20 to $100, anywhere. These actually used to be, when I was in school, hundreds of dollars. And now you can literally buy them on any website for $25. So my honest recommendation is technically, that's not cost-free. I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols, but $25, I'm calling that basically cost-free. You can bring that in and test that. And that's just a little device where you're going to squeeze, and you're going to do it. And I would do your right hand and your left hand. You want to look for asymmetries there, but you want to look for something like-- typically, they're going to give you a value in kilograms. And you want to look for something like a minimum score here of 40 kilograms. Ideally, you're up past 60 would be a really good spot to be in. You want to make sure that there's no less than 10% variation between your left and right hand. Your non-dominant hand actually shouldn't be that much weaker in this test. So what you'll actually see, a lot of times, is the non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger because the dominant hand is more for movement precision, writing, things like that. So you want them to be close. If you are a male and you are under 40 kilograms on a hand grip dynamometer, we're going to need to train that. If you're a female, it's not that much lower, but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point. If you're above 55, we can add it to your training, but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training. If you're a female, if it's above 50, that's my cut off of where we want to go. So that's a fairly cheap one. Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang. So you can hold on to any bar, ideally, one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it. So you don't want to be using a giant fat grip. You're going to have a false reading here. So something like going to the gym and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack. And you want to hang, and this is a simple time test. So in general, we should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds is what we're looking for. 30 to 50 seconds is my good, but we could probably get better here. If you're cruising above 60 seconds, I'm generally pretty happy. This is actually a good example of when females tend to be better. Grip strength on women tends to be strong, and they can hang for quite a long time. So those standards don't really change that much for women. Now, if you are exceptionally large, this thing doesn't scale perfectly. If you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean, it's just hard to hang and hold 240 pounds. Conversely, if you're 145 pounds, even if you're unhealthy, you're going to be able to hang for a long time. It's just not that much weight to carry. So just rough numbers to start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's grip strength. What about strength elsewhere in the body? ANDY GALPIN: The primary ones, you can do an upper body strength test if you would like, although it's not technically something we do very often. I'm happy to do it one at max bench press or something like that. That's great. What I'm generally more interested in is a leg extension test. And the reason I like this is, a back squat is better. A barbell back squat is-- look, that's my jam. That's my life. It's just very technically demanding, and it's challenging. You need spotters. You need comfort. A lot goes into this. So for the average person, a leg extension test is fairly standardized. You don't have to worry about technique, and people can just get into it and go. And so what you want to look for there is a couple of standards you want to hit. Again, a very simple answer here is body weight. Can you do a leg extension with your body weight? ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I can answer that right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: You can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight, but I was on the leg extension this morning, and it was a Nautilus machine. And I certainly could not leg extension my body weight. ANDY GALPIN: Let me clarify. Were you doing a single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: So bilateral, you can't leg extension your body weight? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. But I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight. ANDY GALPIN: OK. So we maybe have some deficiencies in our quads that we need to go after, but that's a pretty good number you want to be at. If you go up in age past age 40, every decade that can come down about 10%, and you'll still be in a pretty good slot. So if you're 50 years old and you're 170 pounds, if you can do 160, you're in a pretty good spot. And then you could just, again, take it down about 10% every decade after 40, but prior to 40, there's really no change in strength, but certainly, somebody in their 40s to 50s should be able to leg extension their body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted. I look forward to our discussion a bit later, talking about how to build strength. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Any of these strength tests, they don't have to be done to a technical true one-rep max. You can use what are called repetition conversion equation. So put on a load that you think is kind of close to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can. As long as it's under five reps total, you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere, and it will tell you, OK, you did three repetitions at 200 pounds. Your one-rep max is probably 215, whatever. So there's estimate equation. So if you don't want to spend the time or you're not truly comfortable absolutely going to your true one-rep max, just get to a number that's fairly close and do as many as you can and then go on line, again, one-rep max estimator equations are everywhere. If you get past five repetitions or so, the accuracy of those equations starts going down. So don't put on something and go, oh, I did 12 reps of it and then try to figure out your one-rep max. It'll get close. You start moving past that, you're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy. So I want to make sure whether you're doing the leg extension test or a front squat test, you don't technically have to do it in absolute one-rep max. If neither of those are an option, another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat or a goblet squat hold. So you're going to hold a weight in front of your chest. A kettlebell is great here. A dumbbell is fine here. And you want to hold about half of your body weight, go all the way to the bottom position, and try to hold that for about 45 seconds. So it's a pretty good indicator of number one, your position. It's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low back stability. So it's a very different indicator than, say, the leg extension test, but it's a really nice one. It doesn't require many moving parts. It's more difficult than the leg extension, but it's quite a bit more functional. And it's going to give you insights into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat and then returning to a standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. And if you can't do the return, actually, I'm not that worried, but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical breakdown in that 45 seconds, that's a really good spot. As an intro, I want a third of your body weight for 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon. What about hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: Sure. Actually, before we get into that, I want to jump back really quickly. It's important to add a couple of caveats to the strength training stuff. So there's two that I want to do. Number one, these are assuming you are technically proficient. So I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you're not comfortable with your technique. So adjust these accordingly. If you're not comfortable with the front squat, do the leg extension. If you're uncomfortable with that, do something different. So we never want to utilize maximum testing if it's going to come with a consequence of serious acute injury. So that's the most important flag. The second one is, your warm-up protocol will have a huge effect on your actual results. And so whenever you do these tests, especially if you're going to do a test and then a test again down the line, you want to make sure that warm-up protocol is standardized. Now, again, the NFCA-- and I can give you resources-- has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm-up protocol prior to one-rep max testing. So we can go there, and you can look that stuff up. We can add that to show notes or something. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And I think when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general, maybe we could touch into the best warm-up protocol. I know I have mine, and I'm certain it's going to be suboptimal based on everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe that's causing the problems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --based on every conversation we've ever had, where I learned all the things I'm doing incorrectly. But I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me. ANDY GALPIN: It's not incorrectly so much as it is suboptimal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a very kind way of telling me it's incorrect. Thank you. What about hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: So the thing you want to pay attention to here is, you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy. That's entirely up to you. There is no rationale. You can decide what you feel like looks good or doesn't look good. That's irrelevant. There is a sufficient amount you need to have, where below that, it's detrimental to your health, regardless of your outcomes. And so the best way to do this is a couple of ways. Any sort of body composition tests can do this. So whether this is a scan through like a DEXA scan, which is a gold standard or other ways of biological, bioelectrical impedance or otherwise. So there's a ton of different tests you can get that are pretty close. So what you want to pay attention to when you get a DEXA scan is a number called FFFMI. And so that stands for "fat-free mass index." So you can look at again, any number of online calculators. These are all standard, so it doesn't actually matter where you pull them up. You don't have to worry about looking it up and whether or not it's right or not or something. And so that's going to actually tell you if you have sufficient muscle mass. And so a number you want to look for, in general, is something like if you're a man, your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher. If you're a woman, you want to look for something like 18. So those are the targets. If you get past 24, 25 for a man, that's a lot of muscle mass, assuming you're reasonably lean. Now, if your FFMI is like 24, 25 but your body fat is 40%, you're actually just a very, very large individual. You're not in a great spot. So when we say these sort of numbers, it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% body fat for a man and sub 35% for a woman. So those are the numbers. There are online calculators. All you really need to know is your total body weight, your body fat percentage, and then your height. And you can enter those three numbers, and then they'll tell you your FFMI score, and it'll correct for an adjusted value. And then most of those will actually tell you the grading rubric and then they'll say, good, average, bad, et cetera, but those are the numbers we look at. If you are, as a man, sub 17, as a woman, sub 15, now we're in an area of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle. And in some of our later discussions, we'll talk about why that matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's not sub 17% body fat. That says specifically, the FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: That's correct, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about muscular endurance? Is this where you're going to tell me I need to do wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: So this is really nice. You can do any number of tests here. A standard plank it is a good test of muscle endurance. So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds? Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds? Pretty easy. If you're able to do a push-up. So if you can't, that sort of tells you alone. It's actually interesting. If you can't do a single push-up, that's not a muscular endurance issue. That's actually now a strength issue because that's a one-rep max problem. So we want to be able to-- again, for a general male, we should have no problem doing 25 plus consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I apologize for interrupting you, but as long as we're talking about push-ups, could you just mention form? Are we talking chest touching the ground? Elbows breaking right angles? What is a proper push-up, according to your laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion, I want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion. This is different for the person. So it's individualized to them, but in general, for a push-up, this would be a full complete lockout of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground. You can do it different. It doesn't really matter, but just keep it standard from your pretest to your post-test if you're trying to mark progress, but for us, unless we have a very specific reason, we're going full range of motion for all of these tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So 25 push-ups for a male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-ups for a male is the standard. And even something like 10 is a number we're looking for, again, as minimum categories for an upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And not to get too down in the weeds, but I have observed other people-- of course, never myself. No, I'm kidding-- but observed other people pausing maybe at repetition 15, catching their breath and then continuing. ANDY GALPIN: That would be a fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So continue like a piston. ANDY GALPIN: That would be a fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just up down, up down, and trying to hit at least 10, but ideally 25. ANDY GALPIN: I learned this lesson in one of our studies, probably nine years ago, where we didn't clarify that. And so we actually had an individual-- he wasn't being nefarious. He just figured out, if I do a couple, take a quick break and do a couple, he quadrupled his post-test results from his pre-test result because he figured out that little hack. So you want to standardize it. It's not that I'm against or have some sort of strong belief. It's just trying to keep protocol standardized, which means any break, failed test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 10 to 25 push-ups, minimum, for males. What about for females? ANDY GALPIN: So I'll clarify. If it's sub 10 for a man, that's again, and you're like, very severe red flag problem. We really, really like to see a number above 25. That's where we're anchoring. Anything between 10 and 25 is like, yeah, but not severe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It means they have work to do. ANDY GALPIN: We have work to do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for females? ANDY GALPIN: For a female, you're going to scale that back. So a female, the answer could be as little as zero. So you're going to see that, can you do a full position? If they're in that position, we're generally not going to do a muscular endurance test from the knees. We already know the answer is you're zero. We'll actually default to another test, which I'll talk about in a second here. So for those folks, that's going to scale down a little bit. So basically, you're looking at 15 is that marker, like 25 was for the male, where I want to see above 15. And if I do, we're good. Anything between five to 15 is the number of, OK. If you're sub five, we generally have some problems. And if that is different, between one and zero, then zero is a problem. So we should be able to do that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if a female cannot do 10 full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard for a female, depending on size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Let's say a female can't do five full push-ups. You said, rather than go to a knees-down version, what would you do to assess their muscular endurance? And would you then also encourage them to work on their strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. So again, if they can't do-- they can do anything less than three, you're going to be strength. In fact, if you want to look at muscular endurance in general-- so this is a bit of an off topic, but I promise I'll keep it short, and I'll come right back. When I was a doctoral student, I had two lab mates. One of them was a runner, a female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. The other one was a male, and he was basically like a straight bro, he lifts weights, doesn't do any other sort of training. Does a very classic not training program, but kind of training. And they were bantering back and forth for a while. And basically she was saying, you're so unfit. You can't run at all. And he's saying, you're so weak. You can't do a pull-up. And so they challenged each other to a competition. They said, at the end of the year, the girl is going to do 26 pull-ups, and the guy had to run a marathon, so 26 miles. So that was the thing. And then there was some sort of consequence for whoever failed. So the guy quickly tried to figure out, how the hell am I going to run 26 miles when I have not run a mile in many, many, many years? So he just started running, three miles, four miles, whatever. Well, of course, both of them ran immediately to me. And then she was like, how the hell? I can't do a pull-up. And I was like, great. And I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol. And she was like, whoa. I want to go to the assisted pull-up machine and work on doing sets of 25 because I've got to get my muscular endurance up. And I tried to explain to her, your muscle endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one. It's never going to matter. She did the muscular endurance protocol, the entire thing. Didn't listen to me. The end of the year came. She still produced exactly zero pull-ups. So the point is, if you look at muscular endurance, where is it strength and where is it actually muscular endurance? The general number that you're looking for is under 80%. That's going to tell you, is this a muscular endurance problem or is it an absolute strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under 80% of a one-repetition maximum? ANDY GALPIN: Yup. So what I mean by that is this. In fact, this actually is in your question. The other way to assess muscular endurance is take the exact strength tests you did from the talk five minutes ago, which one did you do? Load that to 75%, and then do that for as many repetitions as you can. And that is a tremendous barometer of muscular endurance. So if you were able to do 200 pounds in your leg extension test, put 75% on that and do that as many reps as you can. You want to look for more than eight repetitions. If you are below eight repetitions, then we have a muscular endurance problem. If it is higher than that, if you've got 15 or 20, then we know we have probably some problems in your peak strength or the test itself. So that is a good-- eight to 12 number is where you want to be looking at for there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: This one's more challenging. You either have to go to a laboratory and do something like a Wingate Test. So this is a 30-second maximal test where you're going to see how much work can you possibly do in that 30 seconds. If you don't have access to laboratory, you can do this on any protocol you want. This could be sprinting. This can be on an air bike. This could be on a rower, anything like that, anything where you can exert maximal effort and you don't have to worry about technical problems. So I generally don't like to do things like a kettlebell swing or something like that. There's just too many other variables. You need to be able to go as hard as you possibly can, knowing you're going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue. Now, in the lab, we often use what's called a Bosco Protocol. And you're going to stand on a force plate, and you're going to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can, as high as you can, for 60 seconds. And you are absolutely destroyed by second 45. So we'll either use that Wingate Protocol or that Bosco Protocol. If you want, though, again, take any of those other places, 30 seconds or so, up to 45 seconds, up to a minute if you want, it doesn't really matter. And you just mark down the distance you cover. That's all. We don't really have standards for these things because it's going to be different. How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill is just going to be so different than sprinting in the field or on the assault bike or whatever. So what you really want to worry about there is, can you complete it? And then how awful do you feel afterwards? So what you really want to think about here is not those protocols, but this. You want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate? So the number we throw out is 220 minus your age. So if you're 50 years old, 220 minus 50, you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate of around 170 beats per minute. Now, that number is extremely generic. If you don't get there, that doesn't have any indication of your fitness. If you get higher, that doesn't mean you're any more fit. It's just a rough number. So here's what I want you to do. In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric. So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate and then test your heart rate recovery. And what you should be looking for there is about a half a beat recovery per second. So you're going to get up to a place where you reach absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test your heart rate, and then count. Have a timer going. Within 60 seconds, you should have, again, that half a beat per second. You should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute. Within the next minute, so two-minute recovery, it should be, again, half that, so 60 beats. Those are rough numbers to go by. And your three-minute recovery is, again, half of that again. So that is the closest way. If your heart rate recovery is worse than that, then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity or your cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. What about number eight, maximal heart rate? Because what you just described sounds a lot like maximal heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: So this is your VO2 max. So the gold standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done. So we can actually run a VO2 max test, where you put a mask on, collect all your gases, and run you to there. And there is a very specific protocol for completion of a true maximum test. And any scientist will know that. If you don't have access to that, you can do a couple of tests. One of them is called a 12-Minute Cooper's Test. So this is simply time. You're going to run for 12 minutes as far as you can, and you're going to record the distance you covered. Again, you can go online to any number of calculators, enter that distance in. And that will tell you your proximal or estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a 12-minute sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping a steady pace the whole time or going-- ANDY GALPIN: Do whatever you want. The goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes. So that's anywhere between a mile to two plus miles, depending on how fit you are, but you just do that Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. ANDY GALPIN: I told you. So if you remember, aerobic capacity is eight to 12 minutes where you're going to see a real true test of that VO2 max. You simply can't get that in under a few minutes. So if you want, you can do a little gentler version of that. So there are a number of submaximal tests. In fact, there is a one-mile walk test you can do. So again, all you're going to do is-- in this case, you have to have of either a stopwatch or, ideally, a heart rate monitor. And all you have to do is-- this is a walk for one mile submaximal test. So you're going to walk a mile, record the time, record your heart rate at the end, enter those in. And those will give you, again, estimates of your VO2 max. So that's the like, oh my gosh, I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can or I don't want to do it. We have a lot of these in our executive program. It's like, my knee hurts too bad. I've got back pain when I run or whatever. Can I-- OK. And you do the walk test. And it's pretty accurate if you do it correctly. So technically, all you have to actually do is measure your heart rate on you neck and count 60 seconds, but it's just easier to-- with everyone's watches and stuff now, just wear the heart rate monitor, plug in those numbers. And again, those are all standard calculations. So anywhere you find those, you don't have to worry about the source. So you just enter your stuff in, and they're going to be running off the same equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like the idea of the 12-minute run. I'm going to give it a shot, see what happens. ANDY GALPIN: For years, we did a one-mile version of this, and there's just a lot more science on the 12-Minute Cooper Test. So we did that. It's pretty good, and it is not even remotely close to fun. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It sounds like fun for other reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah. Well, it is it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun in the sense that it reveals a lot. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super. There's no hiding. You can hide with the leg extension test. It doesn't hurt that bad. But you cannot feel anything but the 12-minute "run as far as you can" test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests-- ANDY GALPIN: They are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of a sort. ANDY GALPIN: For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. I think of this as a.k.a. endurance, but as you mentioned before, there are other forms of endurance. So long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. So you really want to think about this as not a standard number. You should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes. And this one I want you to just pick something that it was in your lifestyle. So is there a loop around your house that you can do? Is there some protocol that you like to use before? And you're simply going to test your ability. Can you maintain work without stopping? That's all it needs to be. Now ideally, I personally like to throw a little twist in here, which is, can you do this with nasal breathing only. That's when I feel really good. If you can go 30 straight minutes without needing to take a break-- walking doesn't really cut it unless you're very, very unfit, in which case, if walking 30 minutes without a break is a challenge, OK. There. But if you can, I want you moving at a non-walking pace. I don't care what zone this is, two, three, four, five. I don't care. Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing through your nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love this list, but it worries me a bit. Not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming, but because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For instance, do I separate them so I'm doing one test, like long-duration output on one day and I'm doing strength on another day? Those seem pretty obvious to me, but are there ones that one can combine on different days? How much time should one give oneself in between these tests? And how often should one do an assessment? Just as we don't want to necessarily evaluate body weight changes by getting on the scale three times a day, maybe once a day at the same time each day is more practical. How often should we be assessing our fitness for each and every one of these? ANDY GALPIN: Well, the way that I would say this is, you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more frequently. So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic, if you can bench press double your body weight, I don't need to test your bench very often, for the average person. If you're not a powerlifter, maybe once a year or something. Maybe not even that. We just don't need to get there. However, if we then test your VO2 max and in your 12 minutes, you cover a total of a half a mile, then we might want to test that every month. And so we're going to let our priorities emphasize which one we're going to do more often. I would recommend doing this full battery once a year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning the entire list on one day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not on one day, but within a week. So you could take a week. Now, you could do these, technically, all in two days. Three-day split here is probably best. So if you were to just say, hey, this is testing week. I actually love this for beginning of the year or whenever it is that you change your training, but I think once a year, just like once a year you should probably go to a physician and get full bloodwork, a full heart scan and everything like that. And then if maybe you had a heart issue, they would come back in and test you more frequently, whatever the case is. You should probably run through this. And you're going to be thinking, yeah, but I don't want to give up on my exercise routine that week. Well, I promise you, you're not going to finish this week and think, I didn't do very much work this week. It's going to feel great. And then you're going to have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and prioritize your training for the next quarter or half a year or wherever you want to go. If you want to actually do this every six months, we end up, actually, doing this, quite honestly, more like every six months as a general test. That's a really good way to do it, but minimum, if you're arguing with me, give me once a year that you want to do this. So which order to do them in? The non-fatiguing tests, you can do whenever. So this is the body composition scan, the FFMI, the body fat composition. All this stuff can be done whenever. I generally like to do that, though, as your very first activity. The reason is we know that acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition measurements because of inflammation, water storage, et cetera. So it's easiest to just get that off of a 48 hour rest. You want to make sure you don't do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably 48 hours before that. So just start yourself off with that. Your movement tests can be the same thing. You don't want to try to do a assessment of how well you're squatting if you're incredibly sore from your brutal squatting test. So tend to do those things when you're the most fresh. Then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day. And any fatiguing thing happens at the end. And so you could easily do this. All right, I'm going to do my power test, my broad jump, great. You're not going to be fatigued at all from that. And on the same day, since I'm already pretty warmed up, now I'm going to roll right into my leg strength test. And since I'm really warmed up, I'm going to do my leg muscular endurance test right there. So this is a very common strategy we use. We do our one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever we need to do, come back, load it to 75%, do as many reps as you can. Boom. You could roll right into, then, your upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else that you want to do there. Is there a little bit of influence? Yeah, but really, for most people, it's not that bad. What influence I mean. If you do a leg strength test, coming back and doing an upper body strength test afterwards, it's not that big a deal. Give yourself 15, give yourself 20 minutes. Give it plenty of time. So you can knock out your strength testing and muscular endurance testing all in one day. You could do your performance, your skill diagnostic, your power jump test, your strength, and your muscular endurance, and all that stuff is knocked out. You're going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anaerobic tests. This is 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that. You could, though, if you wanted, do that after your long duration tests. You're long duration test again, is just going to function as a big, warm up. Or you could flip those things or you can do them on separate days. You're going to have to do your VO2 max test on its own day, for the most part, unless you wanted to do, again, your movement or your body composition before those things. So you really have the ability to mix and match. Ideally, this most realistically probably takes three days. If you want to separate them into four or five, the more separation you do, the better data you're going to get. It's just a question of how pedantic are you really trying to get here? And are you willing to lose 5% to then save a whole day? Then you can do these things in multiple stacks. So that's how I would break it up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what I'm hearing is, better to do it than to not do it. ANDY GALPIN: Most definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And be rational. Don't try and do your strength output late in the day when you're fatigued. If you're going to combine some of the steady state endurance and maximal heart rate, fine. Understand there might be a slight deficit there, but test it the same way each time. And what you're really looking for is improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. And you can also do the heart rate recovery under any of the modalities. So you could do the heart rate recovery after your VO2 max as well. So you finish that thing, and then just, again, do the same test for up to three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are fantastic tools. I'm almost tempted to say that I'm willing to post my numbers, but that actually violates the core principle that I think we're getting at here, which is that it's highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board. I mean, certainly there will be individuals that are, but based on everything we talked about earlier, specificity of training and how extensively somebody has been training a certain way will, without question, lop side them, if you will, toward being better in some of these assessments and less good in others. And that's just simply the way that these adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. You don't need to be optimal in all of these areas to be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" from this perspective. You just want to make sure, again, there's no severe performance anchors. This is what we call them. We don't want any of these severe constraints because you're going to get limited by that thing. And so what you want to do is move that up to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that. If you do that, that thing's not going to catch you. You're going to be able to continue to pursue optimization in any of the one things that you have a specific passion for, which is generally what moves people. You train so that you feel better. You train because you know there are all these benefits to it. And jeez, this audience probably could list hundreds of them. But you also train because you generally like to get better at something. A lot of us have something. And so you want to make sure that you're not going, hey, I know you're good at endurance, but you really shouldn't train anymore. We don't want that message, not at all. I want you to love your training. We just want to make sure that you're not loving that so much that you're not taking some blinders off and missing another area, which would actually-- again, you pull that performance anchor, this whole ship sails faster, with less effort and less friction. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I love about this is also that, as you've described it, it's not just for athletes or people that are super into fitness. It's also for people that just want to be healthy and want aesthetic changes. And that's why they're exercising, which, I think, accounts for a fairly large percentage of people out there. So I think what you described is incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, and incredibly actionable. So I want to thank you for that I'm serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you. And I think for most people that are seeking what you listed off before aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity, it's clear that all nine of these are going to be important in some regard or another. ANDY GALPIN: So before we close out, I want to go back and finish off the metrics for VO2 max because I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that. So in general, for men, a minimum number we want to look at here is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute. And for women, that would be about 30. So we can actually push a lot higher on those things. In reality, I want to see men above 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN: If I could just interrupt you for a second. When you say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters of what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So what, actually, those metrics mean is the first one, milliliters, is oxygen. So it's amount of oxygen. Kilograms is body weight. So it's, how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight per minute? So does a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration. In fact, the way that you calculate it is you multiply your cardiac output by what's called your a-vO2 difference. Your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume, so how much blood you're pumping out per pump is your stroke volume. How many times you're pumping or you're beating. You multiply that by your a-vO2 difference. Your a-vO2 difference is artery minus vein difference. So it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein, which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capillaries, in your muscles. So you take those two factors, multiply them together, and there's your VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As you were describing that, I imagine you getting to an fMRI machine and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain because clearly, it's committed to memory very well. Thank you for that clear description. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So to finish those numbers, I really, truly want to see a man above 50-- and I'm not even really stoked until I get above 55. In fact, it's sort of funny. Dave Costill, whose lab I did my PhD in-- he was retired by the time, but he's, again, one of these legendary figures in exercise physiology, started in the '70s. He would always say, "There's no human excuse to be below 60," which I was always like, damn. That's really, actually, pretty hard to get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he at 60 or above? ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. he's still, actually, setting world records in these last couple of years, all the Masters records for swimming and cycling and stuff. So he was a super, super fit guy. So he was always above 60. He's probably like 50 something now, even though he's 80 or whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: With a VO2 max of 50. ANDY GALPIN: He's probably really not 50. He's probably-- but he's probably going to-- remember earlier on we talked about how I had the 92-year-old who had VO2 max of 38. Dave's probably going to break that record when he gets there, I'm sure. I'm sure. In fact, I guarantee you he has that number in his brain. I haven't talked to him in 15 years, but I guarantee you that number is in his brain, and he's probably training for it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. And I love it because it proves that exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's one of the few things in life where there's a direct relationship between work and outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. As Henry Rollins described in his wonderful essay, if you're familiar with that. Oh my gosh, you're a punk rock guy. You know Henry, I'm sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, I certainly know who he is, and I know his work. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. He has incredible one-page paper. It's something to do with the iron. And he basically describes that as, this is the one thing where it's truth. It is the most true thing you'll ever do, which I love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's almost like a principle of nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. So with the women, I really want to see the women-- if I want to see men above 55, I really want to see women above 50 as the target. And if you like, you're there, I'm pretty good. So you can do the math on, then, the middle ground of what's like OK, but we need to work on it. In fact, if you look across the literature, at different athletes, you're going to see the really high-level endurance folks, they may pass 70 or 80. In fact, there was talk a few years ago of a guy breaking 100 as an 18 or 19-year-old, but I actually don't think it was ever fully confirmed or repeated, but certainly, you'll see plenty of people 95, in those extremes. If you look at other sports, like football or basketball, they're probably going to be in the 55, 65 range. So if you, as, an average person are 55, that's a really good marker to be in. If you get even close to that, you're in a good spot. I'm sorry if I let you down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. I just love how you're describing this average person, you're looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy, like if you reach the standard of average, Andrew. Listen, you're giving me prompts all over the place to try and improve my metrics, whatever they happen to be. And I think that's one of the great values of getting objective numbers, even if they have to be measured by some of these back-of-the-envelope techniques that, I guess, we always teach people in the laboratory, that a tool can be not extremely precise, but as long as it's reliable, there is still value there. I mean, of course, you'd love to have the most precise and most reliable tool, but if you can't, then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. For the real world, reliability beats validity as much as we can. For a lot of the things we're talking about, especially for using it as a metric of did I get better, as long as that tool is reliable. Body composition, just all of these things have inherent error in them. Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger, but as you mentioned, having standardization within the testing protocol is going to allow you to measure progress. And that's going to tell you sort of where you're at. Now that we've covered all these areas of adaptation, we walked through the history, and we walked through a bunch of the explanations for why people are maybe not getting the results that they want to get through their training, the way I would like to go with the rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure I cover very specific protocols for, if you have run through this testing and identified an area of weakness. So maybe you've been lifting a lot because you like lifting, and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate recovery is not where it really should be or the opposite, like we've talked about. Maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work, and your strength isn't there. Your movement quality is not there. So you've identified a problem. How do I specifically solve it? What are the evidence-based and most effective protocols that I can put myself in for each one of these categories? And I think that would give people a lot of take-home value, but it's going to take us some time to cover. So it's going to have to come across over multiple conversations between you and I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, I'm looking forward to each and all of those conversations. And I want to add just one more metric to our discussion today, which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for amount of useful information per sentence spoke, you would be at the upper level of that metric. You have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge in a clear and concise and, today, listed-out format that is both interesting, grounded in science, and actionable. So on behalf of everyone listening, and certainly for myself as well, I just want to say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, I appreciate the compliments. And I'm looking forward to the next conversation, jumping right into speed, strength, and hypertrophy training and what are the evidence-based and best practices for protocols in those areas.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative and prolific music producers of all time. The range of artists with whom he's worked with and discovered is absolutely staggering, ranging from artists such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Beastie Boys, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down, Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash, Adele, and many, many more. Not surprisingly, therefore, Rick is considered somewhat of an enigma. That is, people want to know how it is that one individual is able to extract the best creative artistry from so many different people in so many different genres of music. Well, as today's discussion reveals, Rick's expertise in the creative process extends well beyond music. In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm of what the creative process is specifically and generally across domains, including music, of course, but also writing, film, science, and essentially, all domains in which new, original thought, ideas, and production of anything becomes important. Our conversation ventures from abstract themes, such as what is creativity, and where does it stem from, to the more concrete, everyday, tool-based approaches to creativity, including those that Rick himself uses and that he's seen other people use to great success. That took us down some incredible avenues, ranging from a discussion about the subconscious, to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind, and how the subconscious and conscious mind interact with nature around us and within us. Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times, but all with an eye and an ear toward understanding the practical tools that any and all of us can use in order to access the creative process. We also spent some time talking about Rick's new book, which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity. The title of the book is The Creative Act: A Way of Being, by Rick Rubin. This is a book that I've now read three times from cover to cover, and I'm now reading it a fourth time. Because it is so rich with wisdom and information that I'm applying in multiple domains of my life, not just my work but my everyday life. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rick has an incredible ability to translate his understanding of the creative process in a way that is meaningful for anybody. So if you're in music, if you're a musician, it will certainly be meaningful for you, but it is not about music. It is about the creative process. And so whether or not you consider yourself somebody creative or not, or whether or not you seek to be more creative, Rick's book and today's conversation sheds light on what I believe to be the fundamental features of what makes us human beings. That is what allows us, unlike other animals, to look out on the landscape around us, to examine our inner landscape, and to come up with truly novel ideas that thrill us, entertain us, entertain other people, scare us, make us laugh, make us cry. All the things that make life rich are essentially contained in the creative process. And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin how the creative process emerges in him and his observations about how we can best emerge in others is and was truly a gift. So I'm excited to share his knowledge with you today. One thing that you'll quickly come to notice about today's conversation is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge about the creative process. In fact, he very graciously, and spontaneously I should add, offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions about the creative process for Rick, please, put those in the Comment section on YouTube. And in order to make those questions a bit easier for me to find, please, put "Question for Rick Rubin" in capitals, then colon or dash, whichever you choose, and then put your question there. I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short, so that I can ask Rick as many of those questions as possible. We will record that conversation, and we will post it as a clip on the Huberman Lab Clips channel. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui, which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA-certified, wild harvesting system to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui. I've talked before on this podcast, and we've had guests on this podcast, that have emphasized the critical role of getting quality protein, not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis but also for repair of all tissues, including brain tissue, on a day-to-day basis. And the general rule of thumb for that is 1 gram of quality protein, per pound of body weight, per day. With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily, and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories, which is also critical for immediate and long-term health. I should say, that Maui Nui he meets are not only extremely high quality, but they are also delicious. I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky. I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes, including ground venison, some venison steaks, and I love the taste of the venison. It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all. It's incredibly delicious. So if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison, go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics, and as many of you have probably heard me say before, I am not a fan of the word nootropics, because nootropics means smart drugs, and frankly, the brain doesn't work that way. The brain has neural circuits for focus. It also has neural circuits for creativity and neural circuits for task switching and for imagination and for memory. There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart, and therefore, the word nootropics doesn't really apply to anything specific, neurobiologically speaking. Thesis understands this, and therefore, has designed custom nootropics that are tailored to your unique needs. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and their nootropic formulas have been a game-changer for me, in particular in the realm of cognitive work. My go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula. That's the one I've been using most often, lately. If you'd like to try Thesis customized nootropics, you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman. You'll take a brief three-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

WHOOP is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking to provide real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better. Six months ago, I started working with WHOOP as a member of their Scientific Advisory Council, as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance. And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear, based on quality research, that WHOOP can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits, even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle in order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance. So whether or not you're an athlete, or you're exercising simply for health, WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions and how to really program your schedule, nutrition, and exercise and many other factors of your life, in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition. If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP-- spelled W-H-O-O-P-- dotcom slash Huberman. That's joinwhoop.com/huberman today, and get your first month free. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements, because Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality. They ship internationally, and they have single-ingredient formulations. If you'd like to access the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Rick Rubin. Great to have you here today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So of all the topics in science, and in particular in neuroscience, I confess that creativity is the most difficult one to capture. Because you can find papers, scientific studies that is, on convergent thinking versus divergent thinking, and there are definitions to these, and they take on different forms. But in a strict definition form, it seems that creativity has something to do with either rearranging existing elements or coming up with new elements. But as I went into your book, which I've done twice. I've read it twice, and by the way, I feel so blessed and honored to have gotten an early copy from you, or a final copy early that is. But having gone through it twice, I'm now convinced that there may not actually be an internal source of creativity that exists on its own right. And the example that you give that, for me, really is serving as an anchor, and tell me if I'm wrong here, is this idea that ideas and creativity are a little bit like a cloud. If you look at it at one moment, you might think that it looks like one thing, where it has a certain shape and texture. But then you look at it a moment later, it could be quite a bit different. And if you look at it an hour later, it very well could be gone. And the reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general have never actually captured a way to even talk about creativity stems from somebody that you knew in person but, as you know, I greatly admire. I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer among the short list of heroes that I have. And I remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed. He was off in different tangents that I couldn't follow. But at one point, he just blurted out that, if you have an idea, you have to write it down. And you may end up throwing it away, but if you wait, it will be gone. And I remember that, and as a consequence, I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas. But what are your thoughts on what Joe said, this cloud idea that comes up in one form in one area of the book? But then I think it's thread throughout the book in different ways. How did that come to you, and how does it serve you in trying to-- I don't want to say extract-- but trying to access creativity? RICK RUBIN: I think the best way to think about it is like a dream. It's like, if you think about your dreams, they don't necessarily make sense. When you wake up, you might remember part but not the whole thing. Then, if you start writing them down, they'll come back, and they may not make sense to you. There'll be a series of abstract images, and maybe, someday in the future, you'll be able to look back and understand what they mean, and maybe not. And that's how the art making process works is like we're making things, and we're looking for feeling in ourselves. And it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm, a feeling of interest, a feeling of curiosity-- I want to know more-- a feeling of leaning forward. And we're following that energy in our body, when we feel there's something here. There's something here. I want to know more. I want to know more. I want to know more. I'll say, it's not an intellectual process. It's a different thing. That's why it's hard even to talk about it, because it's so elusive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, I was listening to a podcast by our friend Lex Fridman. I think it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan, where Balaji, who's an investor-type guy, thinker-type guy-- this is like an eight-hour episode. He says something at the beginning that I'd love your thoughts on. He said, look, we can train a rat to lever press every other time or to expect reward on every even number press or every odd number press or even every fifth number press. But a human and a rat can't do that for like prime number presses. You can't actually train that. And then you think about the reward systems and the way that we follow life, from when we get up until we go to sleep, and what he said is the fact that we can't do that means that we may not actually be in touch with the best schedules of doing things. Like every time I'm thirsty, I take a sip. I assume that's the right way to do it, but it might not be optimal, for whatever purpose. When I was reading your book, I was thinking about there's a set of things to follow, things to pay attention to-- you talk about this-- things to access, that none of the creative process comes from just within us. It can, but it's always being fed by things outside of it. And so what I started to do is, the second time I read through the book, was think about it through the lens of what Balaji was saying was that there may not even be a language for this thing that we call accessing creativity. There's a process, but that language in the form of words is a little bit like trying to use even numbers to try and access prime numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like the math becomes so convoluted that we end up in a conversation like this, where I'm confident we can get to the kernels of it. Because what's remarkable about the book is that you do. You show and inform the process. But there may not be a English or any other language for saying, do this, then this, then this, then this, and you'll have something of creative value. Does that capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. I think language is insufficient to drill down on creativity. It's closer to magic than it is science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So when kids come into the world, do you think that they have better access to this creative process than we do as adults? Because we start to impart rule plays and books. Like will it get likes? Will people like it? But also all the things that are available to us that we're not paying attention to, like the texture of this table, we're discarding things, systematically. We get, quote, unquote, set in our ways. Do you think kids are, just by definition and by design, more creative than adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids, they're open, and they have no baggage. They don't have any belief system. They don't know how things are supposed to work. They just see what is, and if we pay attention to what is, we learn much more than if we-- Most of us select from an endless number of data points available to us to, well, as a species, to make sure that we don't die and to procreate and to feed ourselves are probably the primary functions first. And then we learn things about what's right and what's wrong, and we learn things about how to do certain things. Or we're inspired by someone who makes something we love, and we want to do it the way they do it. And all of those things undermine the purity of the creative process. They can be tools to build your skill set to be able to do it yourself. Like if you're a singer, you might imitate a singer you really like for a while to get good at it and then eventually come to find your own voice. It doesn't always start with your own voice. But if you're three years old or five years old, and you try singing, you're not singing like anyone else. You're singing with your own voice. And when you make something, you're making it based on not knowing. And I think I had the advantage, early in my career, of starting making music without any experience, which was helpful, because I didn't know what rules I was breaking. And so it wasn't intentional breaking of rules. I just did what seemed right to me, but I didn't realize that I was doing things that other people wouldn't do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There is this idea that there are no new ideas. I disagree, because every once in a while, I'll see or hear something that at least seems different enough. RICK RUBIN: I think it's a combination of-- a new combination of existing ideas presented in a new way. I think that's how it works. I don't know. But I will say, it does seem like the things that are most interesting to me have a series of familiar elements joined together in a way that it's creating something that I've never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned that when you are close to or you see hints of creativity that is of real value that it's a feeling, and I also believe that the body is a great source of information. Which once people will realize that the brain, of course, is in the skull, but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body, the whole mind-body thing just falls away. Philosophers have argued about this forever, but it's a silly argument. It's also true that, God forbid, I were to amputate all my limbs, have them amputated, I'd fundamentally still be me. Right? The same is not true if we took out a big enough chunk of my brain, and I still survived. I would be a fundamentally different human being. I'd still have the same name and identity and social security number, but I would behave very differently. Who knows, maybe better? The signals from the body we know, or at least we assume, are pretty generic. Like I can think of 50 different ways or 100 ways that we could talk about creativity today. And we could define it and redefine it and carve it up and serve it up like sushi in a bunch of different ways. But the body sends signals that most of us are-- we have a course understanding of. It's like, oh, my stomach hurts, or my stomach feels good, or I'm not sensing my stomach. Or oh, that feels good. It feels warm. It feels cold. Like most of us aren't trained in understanding how to interpret those signals. So it's almost like you have a few vowels, a few syllables, and there isn't a lot more. Whereas, we talk about our thoughts and our experiences, depending on how hyper verbal somebody is and how much emphasis they put on different sounds, it's near infinite. Not infinite, but near infinite. So for you personally, when you know that you're on the end of a thread of creativity-- maybe you're listening to an artist, or you're hearing something. And you're like there and the your antennae start to deflect in a certain way. Right? Do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation, or is it a thought and a sensation? RICK RUBIN: It's a feeling in my body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it localized? RICK RUBIN: No. It's a feeling of-- I would say it's like a surge of energy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you remember the first time you experienced that? RICK RUBIN: Probably hearing the Beatles, when I was three or four years old. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Three or four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there something wrong with me that the Beatles have never done it for me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe you just weren't exposed at the right time in the right way. There's no right or wrong way, and everyone-- I can love the Beatles, and you can not, and we're both right. There's not-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad we can still be friends. I was a little concerned. I was a little scared to ask you that question. I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure and fragmentary, but good. I've always felt like, gosh, there must be something wrong with me. I like their songs, but they don't-- there's no juice for me there. RICK RUBIN: I think maybe we'll watch-- there was an eight-part series called The Beatles Anthology, which is out of print. But I can try to find it somewhere, and we can watch that together, and maybe that'll make the case for the Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing against them, it's just I'm always bothering you for a story, but like Ramones. I saw that, and I was like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone had to change their last name to Ramone, a lot of them hated each other. There's so much drama in there, and three chords and just-- but to me, it just was like, wow, like kids from New York, that energy. So I think different things for different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that brings me to a question of when something feels creatively right, and you're sensing it, and you're there, let's say in the studio or maybe even you're listening to something that somebody sent you, how do you translate that, given the absence of language? How do you translate that into a conversation with the artist? And again, this could be about writing or comedy or science or podcasting, for that matter. How do you say that, keep going that way, when they might not even recognize that they did it? And I'm guessing a lot of times, they don't. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. Sometimes, they don't. It depends. When we're in the-- I'll try to be in a setting where, as we're talking about it, we can engage with it in that moment. So it's not much good. Let's say I was producing your new record, and you played me something, and I had some thoughts about it. It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you what those were. It'd be better for us to wait till we were in a place where we could try things and see where it goes. So the first thing is I wouldn't rely on language to do it. It would be more of making a suggestion of something that's actionable. We try it, and then we have more data. And either we're moving in a good direction, or we're moving away from-- we're moving towards it or away from it, and we never know. And so it's always an experiment. And maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like, if I gave you two dishes of food and asked you to taste them and tell me which one you like better. Usually, it's pretty straightforward, when you have two choices, which you like better, and I think most creativity can be boiled down to that. That's very different than I wonder how this is going to perform on certain social media platforms? That's different than what is it-- when I'm tasting these two things, which is the one I want to finish eating? And if I were to say, I like this one better, but it needs a little salt, and then put a little salt on it. It's like, maybe I put too much salt, and you know when you taste it. It's like it's that simple. Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that other people might feel very differently, which is part of the challenge. It's like, if everyone tells you A, A, A, A, A, A, and you listen, and you're like that's B, as an artist, it's important to be able to say, to me, it's B. And it's a disconnect, because so much of, when we go to school, it's to get us to follow the rules. And in art, it's different, because the rules are there as a scaffolding to be chipped away, as need be. Sometimes, they're helpful. Sometimes, they're not, and sometimes, we'll even impose our own rules to give something its shape. So we can decide to make a-- we're going to make a painting, but we're only going to use green and red are the only colors we're allowed to use. We decide that in advance, and then how do we solve the problem knowing all we have is green and red? It can-- because otherwise, if there's an infinite number of choices, anything can be anything. It's like, sometimes more choices is not better. So limiting your palate to something manageable forces you to solve problems in a different way. Now, in our digital age music-wise, you can make anything digitally. There's no-- there was a time when, if you didn't have a guitar in the studio, you couldn't record guitar. Or if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on your recording. Now, you can just call any of those things up. So there's infinite choices, and infinite choices don't necessarily lead to better compositions or better final works. Understanding how you feel in the face of other voices, without second guessing yourself, is probably the single most important thing to practice as an artist. Or a skill set to develop as an artist is to I know how you feel, and own your feelings. And the key to that is not I know, so I know what's right for you. It doesn't work that way. It's just I know for me, and the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how I see it. If I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea, it defeats the whole purpose of doing this. That's not what this process is about. This process is I'm doing me, and I'm showing you who I am. And you can like it or not, but either way, this is still how I see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, because in science, having trained graduate students, having been a graduate student, I was very blessed to have mentors, one of who is a real iconoclast. He's dead now. Actually, all my advisors are dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. The joke is you don't want me to work for you. So they all had a morbid sense of humor, so they're laughing about this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: I thought you were going to say they all ate the poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but the last one said to me, you're the common denominator, Andrew. And I thought, oh my goodness, and he said, kind of just kidding, but not really. So it's a little bit eerie. But in any case, he always said-- his name was Ben-- he always said, the one thing I can't teach is taste, and the one predictor I have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionists. Because they're filtering their-- perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feedback of others. He was always looking for the person that was putting up a little bit of a middle finger to feedback. Not so much that they would get things wrong, because it can be badly wrong in science. You can be wrong for the right reasons, but you can also be wrong for the wrong reasons. But people that just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing. And I'm hearing some of that, or I'm hearing that in what you're describing. I also think that there's something about the human empathic process or the emotional process, where when we see somebody doing something and they seem to really not be paying attention to what anyone else is doing-- I guess the crazy person on the street is one version of it, where we go they're just in their experience, and it's just crazy. But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves or the emotion seems to be real, I think there are a good fraction of people who feel a gravitational pull, and they go, yeah, that. And the best example I have of this is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing we were the first-- we were the first to start doing the baggy, sagging clothes thing, and we got teased endlessly one year in school. Then, there was a bunch of hip hop that came out, and guys were wearing sagging their jeans or their shorts. Next year, we come back, and the very same people who were making fun of us we're all doing it, and that's when it clicked for me. I was like, most people don't actually know what they like. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They like what they like because of the certainty of the people that they like. And so the question then is, in this landscape of creative stuff, what's real? What's not real? It's almost like whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of-- a good fraction of audiences, but that's not what the creative artist needs to do. They need to actually depart from that. Do I have that right? RICK RUBIN: Well they're just two different things. Like coming up with a story with the purpose of pleasing someone else is a skill set, but it's more of a commercial endeavor than an artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was thinking, in your book, you describe, again, when you're thinking about the creative process as a cloud, for me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor. And then I think about the biology, the neurobiology, of like strategy formation or strategy implementation and then almost by sheer luck, or miraculously, I turn a few pages later into the book, and there's a description of how animals that are trying to accomplish something-- eat, mate, find water, accomplish the requirements of living-- it requires a narrow visual focus. This is something my lab is obsessed with, and I've been obsessed with. And in that more narrow visual focus, we know that the playbook becomes more narrow. The rule set is more narrow. Now, at some point, in order to come up with a new creative idea, that means that broadening vision is essential, in some way, or broadening thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing, but it's changing the aperture from the standard. The reason we do this is to present something new that maybe you already knew but didn't know you knew it. And for that to be the case, you have to be looking at it. It's not unlike what a comedian does. Comedian makes you laugh. Usually, what they're saying, it's outrageous, but you know that it's right. Just no one says it that way, or no one has said it that way before. But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny. It's like that. It's the same idea as recognizing something that seems really obvious, once you see it, but it seems like nobody else sees it, or no one else points it out. And I feel like science is like that too, because how much of science, once the light flashes over your head, it's like I got it, it just seems like, well, we knew that forever. No one knew it, but do you know what I'm saying? It's like it's so obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: It's so obvious. And I think another superpower of artists is this accepting we don't know anything. When we think we know things, that also limits our world. We think we know it's only like this. This is all that's possible, where nice in this little box. But in reality, who's to say that's the case? Who's to say any of the-- we could take all of what we believe in science now and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch. And we'd probably create a whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs. So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, adaptogens to combat stress, and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion. I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and for the month of January, they have a special offer, where they'll give you 10 free travel packs, plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer, in the month of January, of 10 free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. In an offline conversation one time, you asked a good friend of mine, who's been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang, who's chair of neurosurgery, and I would place him in the top 1% of neuroscientists. He's pulling speech out of people who are completely paralyzed with locked-in syndrome, et cetera. And you asked him, what percentage of what's contained in medical textbooks and training-- RICK RUBIN: Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. If you went to medical school today, and you learned what was in the textbook, what percentage of that information is accurate, and what percentage is not? And he said, maybe half. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right, and you asked, and what is the consequence of that? And he said, incalculable, and I completely agree. And I asked him a second time, and he still came up with the same answer. So that's a good sign. Reliability from experiment to the next is good. Yeah. I think that there is this idea that we really know things. In science, we've observed amazing discoveries from chance. We've observed amazing discoveries from incredible bouts of hard work. In both cases, people were spending a lot of time in the lab. Like no one walked into the lab, saw something one day, and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery or fundamental discovery. They were all hanging out in lab a lot. Just some of them came up with something that they didn't expect. Others were drilling toward an answer. RICK RUBIN: And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen-- I'm guessing. I don't know this-- that considering we assume this information, then this discovery is true, based on everything that came before it. But if everything that came before it is wrong, then the discoveries are probably built on a-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like the context, everything that happens takes into account that the context that it's sitting in it fits in that context. Maybe that context isn't right. Who knows? We don't know. So I'm saying, we're too close to most things in thinking, when we think we things, where there are a lot of assumptions that go into it. And that any new discoveries are essentially built on top of these beliefs, but they're beliefs. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember-- of course, I listened to the Beastie Boys growing up. Who didn't? I was a child of the 90s, and they were in the-- Sabotage was an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones and like the girl movies. And those worlds, the Beastie Boys and skateboarding were really closely interwoven for a while. Some people know that. Some people don't. And Spike formed the bridge, and then Spike went off and started making more bigger movies that more people watch. But let's just use them as an example. I heard you say once before that you guys were joking around, like Beastie Boys, like these guys doing hip hop, but it was kind of like the hardcore scene, in New York, punk rock scene, and it was a joke. There were a lot of inside jokes. When you were working together, was there the thought that people might love it, might hate it, or you just weren't paying attention at all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention at all. Never considered it. There were no-- at that point in time, when we were making Licensed to Ill, hip hop music was a tiny underground thing. And no one making hip hop at that time thought it would ever mean anything. It was not a realistic thought. So we were making it really for our crazy friends, and that's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think, nowadays, the fact that one can create something and, quote, unquote, release it quickly. I can put something out onto Twitter or Instagram now. We could do it in 10 seconds from now, and I will get immediate feedback, which is external feedback, of course, but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback. Do you think that's problematic for the larger opportunity for creativity? In other words, if we were to go back 20 years or even 15 years, when the opportunity to create was certainly still there, but you really didn't know how it was going to land until you, quote, unquote, released it. It seems to me there was more opportunity to stay in that magical rainforest that is the creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: I don't think it's wrong or right. It's just more information that you can use or not use and use it in a useful way. And you can make something and put it out, and people could not like it. And you're like, oh, they still don't get it. I'm going to I got to go harder. Like I got to go harder in that direction not-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like not to react away from information. It can be helpful. It can be helpful when-- there could be different stories that happen at the same time. Where you're making something, and you have an idea of what it is. And then other people engage with it, and they have a different idea of what it is. And they like it for a different reason than you did or dislike it for a reason different than the reason you like it. We can't control any of those things. The only part of it that we can control is how we relate to the thing that we make. And any external information that undermines the clarity of that connection is probably bad for the art is my guess. And again, I'm only saying this from my experience. I try to make things-- all I've ever tried to make was something I like or something that I felt like was missing as a fan that I wanted, and nobody was making it. So I'll make it, but it wasn't-- it was always in the service of I love this thing. I want something like this. No one else is making one. I have to make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It's beautiful, because the word that keeps coming to mind is it's almost like a compulsion. Like there are other options of ways to be and to behave and to function and work in life. But if something is a compulsion, it yanks us away from those other opportunities, just enough that we have to get back to it. You've talked before about, and you talk in the book, this notion of the source. And to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist lens on this. I think of the source as not one brain area but some function within the brain, where we are in touch with our bodily signals. Like what feels right, what doesn't? Or like tasting the two foods, I love that example. And that it's a playbook that is far more vast than the short term adaptive playbook, like this how I'm going to get from point A to point B. And yet, when I listen to an album or a song, I have to assume that there, at some point, it becomes not strategy development or creativity but strategy implementation. Like there needs to be the songs are going to come in this order-- and I don't know much about music. My musician friends are always laughing. RICK RUBIN: It's not so much about music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, but the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera. So at what point does one decide, OK, like now's the time to get into that more narrow focus of effort? Like we've got it. Let's run with this. Because there is a component of the creative process that involves packaging and finishing. And is that part less satisfying to you, or is it just all part of the same larger arc? RICK RUBIN: It's all part of the same. It's nice. There's a good feeling. There's usually a good feeling when something is done. On the one hand, it's a commitment, because up until the time that you say it's done, you can keep experimenting and changing it. If you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better, then it's not finished. And you keep thinking that for a long time, you can do that forever and never put out anything. So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off is a good feeling, and it allows you-- one of the things I talk about in the book is, because it is a difficult thing to do, because it's fun to play, and it's fun to maybe it's not the best it could be yet. To use whatever the next project is going to be as motivation to finish the one you're working on now. Like I'm working on this. I'm spending all of my time on this thing. It's really good. I believe it can be better, but there's this other thing that I really want to make. And if I keep tinkering with this one, I'll never get to make the other one. So using other projects as an impetus to finish something and release it into the world is a good one. And you said your description of source is something within us. I don't know if I would say that was accurate. It's definitely in us too, but it's not only in us. And it's I think of source as the organizing principle of everything, and it's how everything exists. How the trees grow, and why there are mountains. And anything that we can see in the outside world, and every discovery and every piece of art and every new design and every machine are all outgrowths of this source energy. Our part of it is the antenna that connects to it, and maybe where the vehicle for source to allow things to happen in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And thank you for that, because I did indeed misspeak. Because I recall very distinctly in the book, you described how the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and certain things. The imagination is unconstrained. And I think I have this right, that you said the work set somewhere between those, it's neither of one nor the other. That ultimately what feeds into all of that are imagination and the way, indeed, that our brain is a physical entity. The nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite if not infinite options. And I love the example of the color palette. That if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints or medium I have, then it's restricted. But in nature, there's an infinite number of shades and tones and combinations. RICK RUBIN: And even on one, if you pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock and tried to find a paint to match that rock, it would never match. There's too much. There are too many variations in nature within a single color rock for us to get close. There's too much information. We scratch the surface. We're only scratching the surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we love when we are able to peer in at different scales, spatial scales, time scales too, but spatial scales, the delight that comes from that that these nature pictures-- seemed like there were more of these in the '80s, like where you'd see a drop of oil shot at very high resolution. There's beauty in a drop of oil. And then you'd see the Earth and the galaxy, there's beauty in that too, these extremes. And of course, our daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions, walls, and sometimes outdoors. There's a brilliant neuroscientist, and not surprisingly, he has a Nobel. His name is Richard Axel. He's at Columbia University. He's outrageous personality. Chews Nicorette nonstop. You guys would get along great, not because of the Nicorette, but because his perspective on things is very abstract for a guy who's solved-- he won the Nobel for solving a great problem within how we smell, perception of odors and tastes. And he says that everything that the brain does is an abstraction. Like I could take a photograph of your face and show it to you, and you'd say, yeah, that's me. Or let's say for the moment, I call myself an abstract artist. Let's just play a game, because I've never been accused of being an artist. And I do three dots and a squiggly line, and I say that's you. And you say, well, that doesn't look like me, and I say, but that's my abstraction of you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, the brain essentially does that, because or something in between that. Because there's no actual photograph of you in my brain. It's just a bunch of neurons playing what we call an ensemble, like a different keys on a piano. And we go, Rick, I recognize you, Rick Rubin. And so everything is an abstraction, and it's only once we start tinkering with the parts-- and this is the essence of science, to remove and add and manipulate. And the best example I can come up with would be Rothko. And I only we come up with this example because I started off in vision science and maybe this will make the most sense to everyone, except the folks who've been blind since birth, and they can swap something in here. That if I show you a Rothko, and I don't tell you it's a Rothko, you may or may not actually think it's that impressive. It depends on your taste in art. But what Rothko did, which was amazing, even if you don't like Rothkos-- and I happened to-- is that he removed all the white and high contrast-y stuff. And when you do that you alter color space, and so the colors look very different. Some people saw that dress a few years ago, is it orange, or is a gold or whatever? That was a little bit of the same phenomenon. I doubt-- in fact, I'd be willing to bet my left arm that Rothko knew nothing about the neuroscience of color perception. But somehow got to this place where, if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast and the paintings were large enough and on the appropriate wall, you saw them a certain way that tapped into something fundamental. And this is where I think art and science really converge, is that, every once in a while, we see something that feels amazing to enough people-- and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon, not just because other people think it's cool. But there's something there, and again this defies language. And I have to imagine that in your years of life and music and other creative endeavors, that every once in a while, have you ever encountered something where something fundamental keeps showing up in different form? Or there's something like almost like a rule or a principle, does that ever come about? Because in science, we think of this as like this is reveals something about our limitation to abstract the world. I hope I made that clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly but I have a thought. You talked earlier about the drop of oil, the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph-- or we could use, on the other side, like Hubble telescope images of these vast things in high definition. What we see every day is as impressive as those things, but where numb to them, because we see them all the time. And if we were to look at drops of oil every day in a microscope, a month from now, we would not find wonder in that image. So sometimes, it's the novelty of not seeing it from that perspective before that's really thrilling. And I could imagine, and this probably relates to the Rothko idea, that you could see something from a particular angle and have this magical experience. And then walk three feet to the side and see it from a different way, and it just evaporates. It only works-- it only triggers this thing in us when we look at it just the right way. There was an experiment I just heard about, heard about the other day, that sounds fascinating, that a painting teacher recommended. Where instead of painting-- having a model in the room and painting the model, that you have the model in the next room. And you go into the next room without your equipment. You don't have your equipment, and you can study the model for as long as you want. And then you go into a different room, where you can't see the model, and paint the model, instead of-- and it changes your relationship. We're not just painting the lines. We're painting what is interesting enough about what I saw-- what are the data points that stuck in my mind? And when I string those together, what do I get? And what do I-- how do I form it to get as close to whatever the experience of that person was, which the closest of getting to the experience of that person in the painting might not look like a photograph. It might look more different then more the same to really see what you see. If we think about the Picasso paintings that were inspired by African art, where the eyes are on different levels, they may give us more information than a photograph would give us. I'm thinking about when you were describing the sensation of when something takes your breath away, and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset. Anyone you know, when there's a really dramatic sunset, or if there's a whale, and if anyone's on the beach, and there's a whale, everybody's really interested that there's a whale. Do you know what I'm saying? These feelings of wonder, we get to experience them, depending on where we are. Or a dragonfly or a bird flies into your space, these things happen. And when they happen, it's like we're confronted with the mystery of the world, when we change the perspective. Normally, we don't think of whales in our backyard or birds in our house, flying freely, but they do happen. these things do happen, and they like break us out of our trance when these things happen. It's like, oh, yeah, there are birds like this everywhere. I'm just not paying attention. This guy is coming in to tap me on the shoulder. It's like remember me? Here I am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I would say that the whale example and what you're describing is it's revealing to us how-- in a delightful way-- how deficient our perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a little bit like the Rothko is revealing how-- I've never thought about it this way until this moment-- is revealing to us how color normally looks is actually, first of all, not the only way it looks. Those colors we think are one way, but all of color-- this gets into the biology of color vision-- is all about contrast. What something is next to dictates what it looks like, and that's the origin of that dress meme or whatever you call it. I still can't figure out exactly what a meme is. Someone will eventually tell me. In the same way, when you see a whale, and it's delightful, I think it's revealing to us the extent to which those whales are-- the ocean is vast. There's a whole universe there, and we are blind to it all the time. And I think the misperception-- or the misconception, excuse me, is that we're delighted because we see the whale. We might be just as delighted because we're getting hit with the contrast of how little we recognize all the time, and in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy. And I've been watching more comedy lately, and sometimes, it's the shock. Sometimes, it's the absolute truth that's revealed, and then other times, what I've noticed-- and I saw Rogen do comedy at the Vulcan Club, in Austin, which he does every once in a while. And it was small club, and he was leading out this story during his routine or bit, I think. Right? This bit, and everyone knew where it was going. We all knew, and then when he finally told us, it was exactly where we thought it was going, and it was hilarious. RICK RUBIN: And it felt good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it felt amazing, and I thought in that moment, I was like, wait a second, how did he pull that off? That was masterful, because normally, it's this thing like you create one story. There's like a scripting out, almost like a courtroom lawyer. And then they kind of pull the curtain, and it's something different. And if you look at the science, the neuroscience, and brain imaging of laughter and humor, which I've looked into, to be honest, and no disrespect to the people in that field, it's pretty lame. It's lame, because it's always the jarring nature of a surprise. But what he led us to was something that, oh, no, he's actually going there. Oh, wait, he's really going there, and it was this anticipation with a beautiful delivery at the end. And so I'm convinced that, based on what we're talking about here, that there's something about when we see something, we think it's about that, but that the delight that we feel could be about the other experiences that now become, in a subconscious way, like ha. It's almost like laughing at this perceptual deficit that we have. It's almost like laughing at how little we actually know, which is what you've said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. It could be that. It also could be the sense of community of when you think it's going to go a particular way, and it goes that way. It's like reinforcement of you. It's like, yeah, he's saying it, but in a way, we're saying it together. I'm listening, he's saying it, but we're in this together, and that's a good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have to think about that for a second. I was trying to think about why certain music still can evoke such powerful emotions in me. And there does seem to be something special about the music we listen to when we are teenagers. From about 14 until about 25, it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way. Maybe because that phase of our life is really one of identity crisis. You don't find too many 40-year-olds, some, who are wondering like who they are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, but almost every young teenager or pre-teen and is like who am I? You're defining personality. So I always likened it to that. But leaving out the critical period biology stuff, what do you think it is about the music that we hear at that time? Are that much more emotionally tuned? Have we not shut down our sensors quite as much? Because the songs and the artists don't matter, because they're very individual to me. For other people, it will be the Beatles or something. Now, I just really wish the Beatles did it for me too. But do you think that's important? Because I could see how it's really terrific. I could also see how it sets up one of these what I'll just use nerdy language and call like a semi-deprived filter. Because if I'm only looking for the way that a Stiff Little Fingers track made me feel the first time I listened to it, when I was 15, the feeling is worthwhile. But if I'm looking for that, I'm missing all the other stuff. I'm missing the Beatles. I'm missing Fleetwood Mac, which never did it for me either. I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff that people I love and respect really love. So I've never worried about it, because there's an infinite treasure trove of other things that I do love. But I do sometimes wonder whether or not my life experience is diminished, because I'm not allowing range. And you've, obviously, worked in a huge number of different genres of music. Punk is one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? And in some sense, as I list these off, just think about how much in high school, maybe nowadays less so, but even in college and as an adult, societally, were asked to constrain ourselves to one of these groups. I didn't know it was OK to love Bob Dylan and love punk rock as much as I do, until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I was like-- and recently, he told me he loves the Grateful Dead, and I was like, whoa. But I remember when you had to pick. RICK RUBIN: Both the Ramones and the Clash love the Beatles, so we can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. I got work to do. RICK RUBIN: We'll do it together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN: I have a feeling part of it is, the reason it gets in at that age, is it's a time when we're defining who we are, and the music is part of the definition of how we see ourselves. Like the music that we hear before that might be the music that's on the radio or our parents' music or our older brother or sister's music. And then when you're 14 or 15, and you start choosing what you're listening to, it's like, now it's finally mine. And my parents might not like it, and my older brothers and sisters may or may not like it, but this one is mine. And it always has that impression in us that this is ours. My that's my thought of why it continues to last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How do you wipe the slate clean then? So for instance, if you're going to go in and work with somebody new-- and again, as people are hearing this, I hope that they're transplanting this to whatever it is that they do. Because in the realm of science and podcasting and communication, it's not music, but there's a contour and a way. Hopefully, this podcast will look nothing like it does in five years. That's my hope, is it will still have the core features of the beauty and utility of biology coming through, but I hope it doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK RUBIN: And I think it'll evolve as you evolve. It's just, the truer it is to what interests you, and if you're not interested in biology in the same way in five years, I would hope it's not the same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here. In therapy, we'll all be lying down on couches. RICK RUBIN: Whatever it is. Whatever it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We probably won't be on psychedelics, but we might be levitating. You never know. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done, for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors-- lipids and hormones and so forth-- but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors-- hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health-- to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So how do you-- let's talk a little bit, if you would, because I know I'm very interested in your process. I'll spare you the daily routine question. It's very cliche. But you and I are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons, and not as a trivial source, as an amazing gift of energy. Right? And there aren't words for it really. Aside from your daily routines, when it comes to somebody you're going from project to project, and you know you're going to be doing work with somebody, could be your own work. And we'll talk about the writing of this book and its structure which is very unique. I've never encountered a book with this kind of structure before, and it's the most facile read ever, and yet every single page, I underlined, took notes, starred. And like, as you notice, it's very worn, very, very worn already and only more so over time. Do you have a process for removing the functions of the day and what you were doing last week and what's going on in order to get more access to this-- I'm going to think of it now more as a receiver inside of you. Right? Almost like tuning a radio, [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in. Like the beginning of like a Strummer Clash thing. Right? He love the radio. Joe loved the radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in clear, and there it is. How do you clear the static? What are some of the operational steps that you think might be more generalizable, regardless of where somebody in Africa is listening to this. RICK RUBIN: I would say, when I engage in a particular project, whatever it is, I dedicate all of myself for that period of time, whatever it is. Whether it be 20 minutes or whether it be five hours, whatever it is, total focus, and no outside distraction whatsoever. And when I leave that process, I do my best not to think about it, when I'm away from it. I don't bring any materials with me. I don't leave the studio with works in progress and spend time listening to them during the day or looking for ideas. I stay as far away from it, when I'm not directly engaging in it, as possible. And in the best of situations, I have something else to totally engage myself in in between. So instead of working on project A for five hours, and then leaving and doing nothing, I'm hoping to engage in a Project B or B, C, and D with all of myself before going back to project A again, which might be the next day, let's say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this relates to an amazing chapter and series of writings in your book, that I'm not going to describe, because I want people to find it for themselves, about disengaging, about disengaging from the process. One question I had as I read that chapter, and as you're saying this now, is even though you're disengaged, do you believe that your subconscious is working it through? RICK RUBIN: I believe so. I believe so, and I think in general, to stew over a problem is not the way to solve a problem. I think to hold the problems lightly-- and when I say a problem, when we're starting a project, there's usually this feeling of-- there's a question mark, at the beginning of every project. I'm always anxious when I start a new project, because I have no idea what's going to happen. I never know. I never-- I may have, in some cases, a potential backup plan, if nothing works, but I really try not even to have that. I prefer not to have that. I prefer to go in maybe to calm myself down enough to be able to show up, there'll be an idea of, if nothing works, maybe we could try something like this. But that would only be for my own anxiety. It wouldn't be for actual practical use. But there's always a sense of anxiety, because I know, whatever's going to happen is completely out of my control. Something either interesting or not will appear, and then we're going to follow that wherever it goes. And until something appears for us to follow, I have a lot of anxiety, even though it has never not come. It has come every time, but there's something about it-- because I also feel like there might be expectation on me that I'm going to make it happen, and I know that's not happening. That's not how it works. I show up ready for it to happen and am open to whatever we have to do to find that first thread. And once we find the thread, then it's like, OK, we have a-- and that thread may lead us to anything. It could lead us in a million different directions. But something about having that glimmer, that we're not looking at a blank page. We're looking at, OK, we have the beginnings of, I would say, a map. But it's a map that we don't know where it takes us, and it's just the beginning. It's just like, you are here. If you have a map, and it says you are here, even if you can't see the directions, knowing where we are feels OK. And once we get-- and usually, again, usually in the first day, first couple of days, it happens. But up until then, it's really an anxiety-producing situation, and then I can't remember the original question. So that was the beginning of something completely different. But do you remember what you asked? I don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, we were talking about disengaging, and is your subconscious into it? And then we're talking about, I love this. So like what is your process of wading into this thing? And you're revealing that now. I think of anxiety as readiness. I think about the characteristic features of anxiety, it tends to be a bit of a constriction of the visual field into more of a narrow vision. But that's appropriate, because you want to shed what's going on elsewhere. And then even when people talk about the shakes or this like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety was designed to mobilize us and not always to run away. Rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory, but one of the things that-- frankly, I didn't discover but it was done in my laboratory but is brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, who's now at Caltech, was that we can often observe animals or humans in very high states of anxiety, as they move forward toward a goal. And we always think of moving forward as like this calm thing, these heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like I'm not getting off the back. I'm not leaving the-- giving up my seat on the bus or Muhammad Ali. I bet you they were experiencing tremendous anxiety, but it was in the forward tilt. And so I think anxiety is at least comfortable when we are forcing ourselves to stand still. So it's a activating energy, and that brings up a word that I have written in my notebook as an extraction of a lot of themes from within the book that you and I have talked about before, which is-- and here I'm going to sound very West Coast woo. But I mean it as seriously as it can be stated, that I feel like everything is energetic. We can do things from a place of anger. We can do things from a place of joy. We can do things from a place of delight. I like to think maturing into the idea that joy and delight and love is the ultimate reservoir of energy. But a lot of the music that I like from when I was younger was because of the anger that was thread into it or the sadness. RICK RUBIN: If you think of your relationship to that music, it's a relationship of love. You didn't listen to that to get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: You listened to it because you loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I felt loved by it, because it matched where I was at the time. RICK RUBIN: It was true to who you were and where you were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know that collaboration, there's a wonderful chapter on collaboration, but it's collaboration, as you mentioned before, with the universe, not with others. But in terms of the, especially the kind of work that you've done and do, when it comes to working with artists, I do wonder-- and here I'm not looking for any gossip or stories. I've never been interested in gossip. I love stories, but I'm not interested in gossip. But once you see that thread dangling there, and you're going to go after this. Or you grab on to it, and you're like, OK, now you have a little bit of a map and an orientation within that map. I often wonder, scientists are complicated people. People think they're very boring, but they're actually very complicated. Because they're often living in one limited rule set of the prefrontal cortex. That's how you get good at getting degrees is by understanding the rules of academia and playing by those rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker with the rules. You get your Richard Axels who are very playful in how they go about it, but they are systematic. He's known for rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? When I think of creative artists and musical artists, I think of a bit more zany or loose. Or you watch the documentary about the Ramones, and you're like, wow, there's all this chaos. How-- because so many of the brilliant artists, musical artists that are out there, seem to have some chaos inside them, or their lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. And science too, by the way, there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues. How-- since you don't have 100% control, they need to play the instruments, sing, et cetera. How do you work with people who have it in them but are getting in their own way? Right? And do you think that the internal chaos that a lot of artists seem to have, do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece of the creativity picture, that you can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I don't think it's an essential piece in general, but certain artists, that's how they do it. I would say, I rarely get to see the chaotic part of artists. For whatever reason, they rarely show it to me, and most of them, like most comedians I know, are much more serious about what they're doing than what it looks like from if you see them on stage. There's much more to it, and there's much more focus on craft going on and digging deep than would necessarily be obvious seeing them jump around on stage. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing, the sports nobody really cares about, now that UFC is so popular. And track and field is-- it's a little bit like wrestling. When you go, the people that are there are there because they really love it. We'll talk about wrestling in a little bit, professional wrestling. But Floyd Mayweather is obviously a colorful character and one of the best records in boxing of all time. And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff, and what one sees is the cars and the money. They literally call themselves the money team, and the spending, and there's all the outrageous stuff. But I know someone who was in camp with him who actually was a sparring partner for him, and the lore has it-- they have very closed door sparring or clean ups. But the lore is that he would do-- because nowadays, it's 12, three-minute rounds with a minute in between, used to be 15. But now, neuroscientists stepped in, and it turns out a lot of the deaths were occurring when it was more than 12 rounds. For whatever reason, cut off at 12 really seemed to truncate the deaths. There are other things too. If the dad is apparently a cornerman-- we have someone else here at the podcast who knows more about this than me. RICK RUBIN: That's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The kid not wanting to disappoint the parent correlated with death. I'll get some of this wrong, and they can come after me. But in any case, this guy who was in Floyd's camp said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring, bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest. That he would run three or four times per 24 hour cycle, despite all the critical need for sleep. That his training was unbelievably intense, to the point where he would just chew out, chew up, and destroy all training partners. And yet the perception that we see is it's playful for him. So it sounds very similar. Like what we see is often not what goes into it, that people are intensely rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, and I think, in a way, from a psychological perspective, if you knew you were fighting someone who wasn't taking it seriously, that would give you some confidence, and that would not be a good thing, if the person was actually working really hard, outworking you. Do you know what I'm saying? Like from a psychological perspective, that makes sense to me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what I keep coming back to is that I'm imagining in my mind you have to ends of the continuum. One that is about fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, and then the other side is the cloud. It's very nebulous. Right? And there's this word that I learned from a colleague of mine, when I was down at the Salk Institute, when my lab was there, because he studies this. There's this phenomenon that I don't want to mispronounce, because then it sounds like something else. But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia, and pareidolia is our tendency to look at an amorphous shape, like a cloud or a tree, and think that it looks like something else, an ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The man in the moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that again reveals the extent to which the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things, and we need this. Right? Because I see you walk in the door, and Rick, I recognize you. In fact, we have a brain area, called the fusiform face gyrus, that it literally is a face recognition area. And you could be at any orientation, or I could just see your eyes and know that it's you. There's a phenomenon called propasognosia, where people can see faces. They can describe everything in the face, but they don't know, for instance, that it's JFK or Madonna or Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: It's quite the list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite the list, there you go, Lex. Run for office, Lex. Just kidding. It's hard enough to get you to respond to my texts as it is. So we have these filters, and so we're taking this cloud, and we're deciding what things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what I want to go drill into your process a little bit more deeply, when you approach a project-- so everyone meets each other, shakes hands. Here are the engineers. We're going to sit down. Everyone knows what they're doing, because you work with professionals. And you start going, are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation? Like where are you in that continuum? And forgive me if I'm like trying to surgically go into your process in a way that would disrupt it in any way. But I trust you been doing this for a while, and there's no threat of that. RICK RUBIN: I'm in the cloud, with the exception of I'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side, and I might-- like if something good is happening, I might look over and make sure that we're rolling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a leap over to here, momentarily, but then you get back. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. If I feel like-- if I was in the moment, I would be in the cloud. And if something good starts happening, it would trigger something in me. Like uh-oh, I hope this is-- I hope we're really doing this, because I don't know if we could ever do this again. That would be a thought of-- when the first time the real world would come into the picture would be something good is happening. Let's not lose it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And when that happens, do you-- never been in a studio besides a podcast studio. Do you say, hey, guys, that sounded good. More of that. Or do you wait, you let them continue? Because obviously you don't want to break their flow. RICK RUBIN: We'd never want to break any flow, once it's happening. Yeah. Once something's happening, just sit back and watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do you think there's resonance, like the team of engineers and other people know when "It," quote, unquote, is happening? RICK RUBIN: If everyone's paying attention, yes. When everyone's paying attention, it's usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, the thread will be something different than expected, and maybe not everybody would pick up on it. And that might be a particular-- that might be particular based on my taste or an artist's taste. Or someone involvement might say, let's listen back to that. I think that was better than we thought. That can happen. You said several things, and it was like you said enough for there to be several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I tend to do that. Sorry. Especially with you. I don't get to see you nearly as often as I would like, and so when I do, I confess that I'm a little bit of a kid in a candy shop. RICK RUBIN: I wrote down the brain tells us stories. So you talked about, I walk in, certain data points, you recognize me, but it's a real like looking at a cloud shorthand. We go through our lives doing this all day with everything we see, and the short hand, in the case of me, you know me, the shorthand turns out to be right. It checks out. If it's something we don't know and something we're not familiar with, something happens, we experience something on the street. Something happens, and it doesn't make sense. Something out of the ordinary happens. The first thing is this doesn't make sense. Then, what we do is, again, subconscious, unconsciously-- I don't know if it's unconscious or subconsciously-- without thinking, we create a story that explains what just happened, a hypothetical that makes it OK that what just happened happened. And oh, maybe he's running because his dog ran away, and he's chasing his dog. Maybe that's why he's running. And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be, we relax, because now it's not just a guy running, and this is weird. But it's a guy running, oh, he's probably running after his dog. And now, we register that story that we just made up, without even knowing we were making it up, as what happened. And then later in the day, if someone says, yeah, did you see that guy running out of the house? It's like, yeah, he was chasing his dog. I saw that. And you won't even realize that it was maybe hypothetical story that was the first possible explanation that allowed you to continue walking. Do you know what I'm saying? That's our whole lives. Our whole lives are reacting to things, making up a story of what we think may have happened, without realizing that's what we're doing. And then living the rest of our lives as if that thing that we made up really happened, and we never know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I completely agree. We confabulate from birth until death. There's this well-observed phenomenon in people who have memory deficits. So there's the sad example of this and then there's the everyday typical not-- who knows-- sad or not sad example. So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit, or someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they'll find themselves in the hallway at night and say, what are you doing here? And they'll say, oh, I was going to get a glass of water, but they're walking away from the direction that would make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics who drink enough develop something called Korsakoff syndrome, where a certain brain area gets messed up. And you'll ask them a question, like oh, what are you doing here? And they will come up with incredible stories, sometimes interesting stories, that have no bearing on reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You ask them who their name is-- RICK RUBIN: But do they believe? They believe that's what happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: With 100% certainty, and this actually relates to a lot of the now better understood controversy around repressed memories. You can, especially from young people, you can pull memories from them of things that never happened. This has been demonstrated over and over again. So courtrooms know to be very cautious now about this whole notion of repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: That's good to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, very, very complicated area of the law, as you can imagine. Because we tend to want to trust victims, for understandable reasons. But in terms of accuracy of details, two people have very different accounts of the same experiences, and this has been shown over and over again. That you can do well in the laboratory. It's pretty interesting. So again, because of this selective filtering and storytelling, and we are-- I think it was Salman Rushdie, who said we are the storytelling species. He probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow. I was going to say we're storytelling machines, but that's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We are story-- I would say that the big five, if I had to pick up a brain function, is we are very limited filters. The mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red for every one that we see. So they have access to things we don't have access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're not, as far as I releasing, albums of the Red Hot Chili Peppers caliber, but who knows. Maybe down there they are. I did see something, by the way as a relevant tangent recently, and I don't know if it's-- look, even if it's crazy, it's super cool. If you take a device that amplifies the electrical signals coming from cactus, and you just translate that into a simple rule of conversion to two or three pitches of sound, the music that comes out of it is beautiful, nothing short of beautiful. And when I saw that, the teenager in me thought, you know when we hear whale song, we think it's so beautiful. Like what if they're just like cursing at each other the whole time? Right? Maybe they're in there like a Rogen episode, when he invites all his comedian friends in there. Who knows? Maybe it's a psychoanalytic conversation about their childhood traumas. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But we decide, whale song is beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We decide cactus are just plants. RICK RUBIN: And it's beautiful to us, and we're right, that it is beautiful to us. But it doesn't mean we know anything about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Yeah. So we have these filters, perceptual filters. We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can, and then the brain likes to work in symbols. We tend to like to match that person whose shoes are messed up must be homeless. I've had a couple of instances in life where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant inside a building at an academic institution. It turned out, it was the most accomplished person in the field. That's always cool. Yes, that happened at Berkeley. Then, the other thing that we do is we tend to put symbol-- so we said perception, symbol representations, and then our memories are entirely confabulated, based on already deficient symbol and perceptual representation. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so I never liked the statement that we don't know how the brain works. I think we do know how the brain works, but that it works through very limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So knowing that and accepting it, and it seems to me that this idea of looking to nature, looking outside us, is so critical. And in fact, I hope you won't mind me sharing this, but a few years back, I had sent you something by text. And I was kind of in disbelief about something I had seen in the media. I was like, they got it all wrong. And I knew the person involved, and it was not a good situation for them. And I was like, they got it all wrong, and you wrote back. You said, it's all lies. Back to nature, the only truth. RICK RUBIN: Wow. That's wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I wrote that down. I put it over my desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I still-- I'd tattoo it on my forehead, if I didn't already have it well-committed to memory. But I know that's true. Right? Nature we can look at and it's-- RICK RUBIN: When I say it's all lies, you just talked about our ability to how limited our facility to see and understand what we see. Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: So based on that, that leads us to we can't know much. Do you know what I'm saying? Our resolution is so low on everything that we're really just like we're grasping at straws. We have no idea. We have no idea, and there's great power and knowing that. Because if you think you know what's going on, chances are, you're being deceived. Not because somebody is deceiving you, but because they're telling you what they see, and they don't know. It's all-- do you know what I'm saying? It's all made up. Everything we know is made up. Maybe, maybe it's true. This brings us to pro wrestling. It's the reason that pro wrestling is closer to reality than anything else we can watch or any other content. It's we know it's made up. We know that it's a performance. It's storytelling, and that's how everything is, except we think wrestling is fake, and the world is real. Wrestling's real, and the world's fake. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You talk about in the book-- we're definitely going in this direction. In the book, you talk about this notion of entertaining the idea of the opposite being true. And there are not only emerging but established fields of psychology that are making great ground, I think, into the human psyche, Byron Katie's work and others. Where you take a statement, and you start playing with that statement. You poke at its authenticity. And when I first heard that, I thought, this is hokey. Right? It's just words. And then I realized how foolish I was being, because she's really on to something. And there are others too, of course, but in science, that's exactly what you do. You don't really ask questions in science. You are forced to raise hypotheses and try and say true or false. Now, there are limitations to that approach, certainly. Pure observational studies have been incredible in terms of what they've revealed to us, especially in medicine. A patient that has a bullet hole through a certain area of the brain, you don't go in and say, oh, I hypothesize that person will have a deficit in seeing faces. No. The person wandered into the clinic, and they go, this person sees faces but can't make sense of them. And then you reverse-- you forensically arrive at an understanding. So but in general, we go about things in this way, and considering that the opposite might be true, well, that's a little bit, I suppose, of like seeing the whale at the surface of the water. It's like, well, the opposite of my experience, which is all above water, for the most part, is maybe not the complete experience of life. You start seeing the inverse all the time. So I want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider the inverse all the time, and it really relates to the way that you described how we see colors is based on contrast. So maybe blue is only blue in relation to yellow. So if blue is our choice, if we're not considering yellow, blue doesn't exist. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: It's like, we talk about night. It's only night, because there's day. If there was no day, there is no night. In all of our cases, it's like the yin yang. There's the light and the shadow always. There's always another side for everything, and we focus on one aspect. But if we look at the other aspect, chances are, we'll learn something too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The nervous system is not just able to do this. It's the way it does everything. Two experiments I'll just briefly describe. My scientific great grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, if you force a person to look at something for a long period of time without moving their eyes-- there's a way that you can do this-- the image disappears. Because normally, your eyes are making little microsecods, and you're comparing what you're seeing to what's right next to it. Pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We don't even have to use the example of pressing on the arm. We're sitting in chairs right now, and until I said you know what's going on at the level of sensation on the backs of your thighs, you were unaware of it. Because if you experience a pressure or a smell in a room, you ever walk in the smell is either good or not good, pretty soon, the smell disappears. The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a bell, but we become blind and deaf to it. Because the nervous system likes to habituate the value of that signal when it's there often, and it's only the stuff that comes through signal the noise that kind of jolts us into attention and awareness. And I want to return to attention awareness, which are prominent themes in the book. And I think, in an important way, not just, oh, attention awareness is important, but you also give insight into how to pay better attention, how to pay awareness with the understanding that people are going to go about it differently, but I do want to ask you about wrestling. Because when I was growing up, I lived South of the Cow Palace, and there was some wrestling going on there. I think back then it was WWF. There was a short stint in my childhood where I paid attention to, in particular, was it Koko B. Ware, the guy that had a Macaw? I was obsessed with tropical birds, and he would come in, and he put his tropical bird on the thing. And then George "The Animal" Steele, the guy that would eat the ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So and-- RICK RUBIN: I believe he was a professor. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he really? RICK RUBIN: In real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: He was a professor, but he played Georgia "The Animal" Steele as a wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I loved the movie The Wrestler, The Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: With Mickey Rourke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. One of the reasons I liked it is I once visited Asbury Park. Isn't that where that was filmed? There's a vacant-- he goes to visit his daughter. There's a vacant amusement park or abandoned amusement park scene there that was really eerie, still kind of haunts me a little bit. There's something about the East Coast in fall. All the places that people normally go just for the summer, that we don't have out here in the West coast, people in the East Coast are just tougher than we are. It still haunts me. Great movie. But I remember watching wrestling, and it was at that age, I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, where you're entering puberty, and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development. It's the most rapid period of aging. It's also when we start to change our rule set. Like certain people and certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning. Right? It's not just a reproductive competence time, and when kids, their bodies change. The rulebook changes fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: Our understanding of the world changes in that moment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The moment that a child understands really what sex is and how they got there and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world is kind of passively, or not so passively, being sent through that filter, it's like it's something. It changes the rule book of perception. I view this age, from about 11 to 13, at least for me was a unique transition point. Where the gap between what I perceived as reality and fiction was blurry. This is captured pretty well in that movie "Stand By Me," where they're hanging around the campfire at night. And the kid says, who do you think would win in a fight between Superman and Mighty Mouse? And the other kid says, like you idiot, Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Of course Superman would win. And like to me, that's being 11 and 1/2 or 12 years old. Where your understanding of reality as you know it is changing, but it's not completely crystallized into an adult form reality. RICK RUBIN: That sounds like a really healthy place to be, to me, like that. Not letting it crystallize, I think there's where the downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I have a question specifically about wrestling, but it's really about process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling because it allows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that mode of thinking in which reality, as one conceives it, is somewhat blurry. Or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine. Is that the energy you're trying to export and bring to the creative process elsewhere, to life? Is it that anything is possible, or that we're dealing with archetypes? Because it doesn't matter if it's Koko B. Ware or Randy "Macho Man" Savage, or George "The Animal" Steele and the lovely Elizabeth. I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling. They are archetypes, much like the Greek myths or the Bible or-- no disrespect to the Bible or to Greek myths or to wrestling, for that matter. Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans, but we know that they're a very limited filter too, because people aren't built like square wave functions. We have curves and contours and complexity. So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: I think it maintains that playfulness. Anything is possible. We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling. And it's a way to have a feeling of the energy of a sport with no competition. Everyone is working together to put on the best show they can. So it's more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event, and there's great skill involved. It's one of the few things that I can watch and really feel relaxed. It relaxes me. I don't feel like I have to think about it. I can just relax and enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This brings up a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, which is this notion of dopamine schedules. I never want to reduce everything to dopamine, but dopamine is the universal currency of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking. There are other chemicals involved too, but there's a beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful. And why other people may want to use wrestling or some other endeavor as a way to access creative energy and source. Earlier, we talked about you can train an animal to press a lever three times and then get reward, and it will learn three is the magic number for reward, and then it can switch. It takes a little bit of training, and then they can switch. But they can't do prime numbers. They can't do high abstraction schedules. Humans either. We're not very good at figuring out the rule set for optimal foraging. We do it well enough to persist as a species, at least for now, but it's very likely that we are not tapping into that system as well as we could, and how would we know, if we don't know? It's one of those you who don't know what you don't knows. There's a beautiful experiment that explored when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport or watching comedy, believe it or not. And with the comedy stuff, it was every time there was a surprise, it was kind of that jarring like ha-ha, and they'd measure people's dopamine output. They were also brain imaging. In a game of basketball, it's a beautiful opportunity experimentally. Because every time one team gets the ball or is shooting free throws or something, they're going down court, and it's either going to end up in the basket, or it's not. Might end up on the free throw line, but it's end up or not. So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it. So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's, ah. You're waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, and if something happened where it looked like they were going to make the three-pointer, but then somebody basically swatted the ball away, and then went for a half court shot, like you don't expect that very often, bigger dopamine release. So that's kind of how the dopamine thing works. When you describe wrestling, I wonder, because you don't know the script, it's not one team gets it, then the other team gets it. You don't know who's going to win. Anything could happen is what you said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The availability of that dopamine surge or drip, which is a powerful thing, is completely-- it's completely out of your reach in terms of anticipation. You don't know when it's going to come, but it must arrive often enough that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching. In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize the creative process is a little bit the same. You don't know where those nuggets of gold and those loose threads are, but you have enough experience-- and in this case, I am referring to you specifically-- to know that they are in there. The people walking in this room have a certain level of ability and talent to create that the map will form itself, as we are going through the voyage. And those nuggets of-- here I'm calling them dopamine-- but they are out there, and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process. So I actually think the way you described wrestling as it's the energy of the sport. It's not whether or not it's this move or that move or who wins or who loses. It's the energy, and I'm guessing it's the energy that it creates in you as an observer. RICK RUBIN: Yes. It's the energy creates in me, and the reality that it's honest in what it is, in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is. And again, not because people are lying all the time. We have little data, we make up a story to explain it, and then we say that's what happened. And we have trusted sources who do exactly what I just described and who pass this down as gospel of what we teach. And maybe it's true, and maybe it's not. With wrestling, we know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. We lean towards it not being true, but what's really interesting about wrestling, and maybe one of the most fun things about it, is that, sometimes, real life works its way into the story. Like two wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: In real life. RICK RUBIN: Well, we don't know. It's like you never know. It's like in the storyline, they're getting married or getting divorced, or best friends turn on each other. And it could be part of the story, and it could really be happening, because they do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks their leg. So they're out, because their leg is broken. Did they break their leg? We don't know. They're out. Do you know what I'm saying? We're told they broke their leg. So there's always this like I wonder what's true? I wonder where the line is. We know that it's scripted and/or predetermined. That's how they say, it's predetermined. But we don't know where reality is and isn't, and in some ways, that's our real experience of the world, is this we don't really know where reality is and isn't. We have an idea, maybe. I think in some ways, wrestling's more honest or legitimate, because we start with the idea that it's fixed. When we go to a boxing match, we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed. Yet, it might be, and historically, it's happened. Or there was just something in baseball where-- was it baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't follow baseball. I should know. RICK RUBIN: It was just a big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK RUBIN: One of the teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: The plays, basically. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was it the call signals of the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of the catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You're not supposed to deprogram the-- or deconstruct the call signals of the other team, and I guess maybe a team got caught doing that. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and the team that won whatever the World Series was. So it's like, with wrestling, that wouldn't be a scandal. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, and that's what the world is really like. So in some ways, it's comforting, and there's still this mystery of like, wow, I wonder if that's true or not, because we never really know. If someone gets hurt, did they really break their back, or are they just going on vacation? We don't know. We'll never know. It's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is fascinating, and I feel like there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in not just one direction but in all directions. Like it's one thing for a celebrity to come out and make a statement. That can be interesting or not interesting, depending on the celebrity and the statement and the delivery. And I'm probably going to get this wrong, because I'm terrible at pop culture things, most of them anyway. But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event wearing an outfit made of meat, and I can't tell you for the life of me whether or not that was a statement against meat or for meat. Maybe, it was a statement for the carnivore diet. Maybe, it was a statement for veganism. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Or maybe neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or maybe neither, but it was definitely a statement in that it broke with the norm. And it said to me, OK, she creates different rules for herself or breaks boundaries that other people had. I never heard of anyone doing that before. It doesn't mean they hadn't, but I never heard of anyone doing it before. But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless it crosses a line, in which case, it becomes something else. It becomes almost theater for sake of theater. But what you're telling me is that, within the realm of wrestling, theater is the goal, at some level, and everybody knows it who goes into those arenas, who watches it. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality and say this is reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys, knowing that backstage they're probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except for the kids that are 11, who think it's really real. RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I don't even know if they know. I'm not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The only other person I know who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling to the extent that you have is Lars Frederiksen, the rhythm guitar player for Rancid who loves wrestling. But his statement-- and forgive me, Lars, if I'm getting this wrong-- is that, because he grew up in an area of the South Bay, where there were no teams. Like now, there's the San Jose Earthquakes, but there was no football team in San Jose. He's from Campbell. But there were no like good teams, no sports teams, but they had wrestling, and he had it where? On the television set. And so if you didn't have a-- like I didn't grow up with any organized sports thing. The 49ers were up the road, but for me, it was skateboarding, and I love it for the same reason. You actually never really know what's going to happen. There is no rulebook. The rulebook is made up, but they are very-- it's a unique sport, in that-- surfing's a bit like this too-- in that, they are absolutely maniacal about making things look a certain way. It's not about just doing it. It's about doing it and making it look good. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching it with the front foot, and the trends change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: It's a style. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, and that style is this like nebulous thing of like in fashion or in sports. Right. Whereas with a football, there's some amazing catches. There's even like the catch, which I happen to know is a 49er-- the catch during the Super Bowl. But in general, it's like the goal is get in the end zone, win the game. And I'm sure football players are like cringing as I say this, but it doesn't matter if you run ugly, if you run fastest. In skateboarding, that would never fly. In fact, you'd basically be ridiculed out of the sport. In wrestling, is it the same? Are there style to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: It's all performance. It's all the charisma of the people involved. There's the physical ability, the ability to talk and tell a story, and how charismatic the performers are. Whether you want to watch them, whether you want to see them win, whether you want to see them lose, and whether you're interested in cheering or booing for them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was going to say it reminds me of opera, but operas get released over and over again. You know the story and how it ends when you walk in, if you've listened to it before. So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way. It's real time iteration, at least from the perspective of the-- RICK RUBIN: And it's real time iteration based on because people get hurt all the time. They're doing really crazy physical stuff. So if someone gets hurt, the story has to change. Because in real life, they can't show up next week and do what was planned in the script. So it's very alive, and there's a lot of-- something interesting and unexpected is always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, in a much more calm form, I'll share with you something, I'd just like your perspective on it. For years, I used a tool in order to try and access ideas, since I was a little kid actually, because I have a little bit of OCD, a little bit of a Tourette's. When I get tired, I'll do that. I'm very strategy implementation oriented. I had that when I was a little kid, I needed all my stuffed animals arranged in a certain way. LEGOs had to be-- a little neurotic or a lot. And then science is very much about you have to do things with a lot of precision. And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me when I was in graduate school or a postdoc if I couldn't make it to a really good agnostic front show, or like chaos. The chaos of a punk rock show for me was this reset. It was to release all this thing. And I got energy from it. First time I saw Transplants play, it's was, whoa, because you don't know what's going to happen. And it was scary. And I loved it. The other thing that I used over time to reset this ability to think in a structured way without it feeling like it was overcoming me, maybe even access the same thing in some ways that you're accessing with wrestling was I like to stare at aquaria. I like to go to aquariums or I'd build aquariums. And I would just sit there because you never know which way the fish are going to go. You think it's going that way, but then all of a sudden they'll turn and go the other way. It's completely unpredictable. And I love aquaria because of the tranquility and had them in my lab for a long time. I just adore aquariums because of the non-linearity of it. It's not A, B, C. It's A, Z, Z, Q. And I think this is what some people try and access through psychedelics, but that didn't seem to me like a very good way to do it on a regular basis, whereas with aquaria, the tanks are there. So in your book, you talk about something that I also share a love for, which is how the ocean and aspects of nature like clouds and ocean, they have a predictability to them. We know where they are and where to find them. Fortunately, the sun rises and sets every day, at least for now. And we can count on them with 100% reliability. And yet, they are from the perspective of what physicists would say, they're very chaotic. You can't look at a wave and know exactly how the foam is going to roll out. You know it's going to roll in and roll out. We have the tides, but when I hear about wrestling, I think about my love of aquaria. And I think about my love of punk rock music, for instance, or I think about the ocean. I think in that way that we actually have a need to source from things that have both a combination of structure and no structure. RICK RUBIN: I think it's interesting that there are some places that don't change and some places that change a lot. And I can remember thinking about this. I was walking-- there's a beach that I walk on in Hawaii, that I walk on every morning when I'm there. And if you walk on the same beach every day, you get a sense of what it's like. And I remember I was in Hawaii. I walked on the beach every day for a year or however long it was. And then I left for six months, then I came back. And the next time I walked on the beach, it was an entirely different beach, entirely different. And I remember thinking in that moment like this is an unusual place because I pictured the house that I didn't even grow up in, the house I lived in maybe for the first seven years of my life. And I think about what the backyard looked like. And I think about a particular old tree that was there. And I don't know this for sure, but my sense is, if I were to go back to where I grew up, and go to that place, and look in that yard, it would probably look pretty similar. Yet, here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii that in the course of six months completely changed its face. And just how interesting both of those things are. And that depending on the project we're working on, to be able to go to a place that we know has the potential to change a lot and what that would do to our connection with the Earth when we're experiencing that versus going to a place that has very little change. And you can count on it being the way it's always been. That both of those are interesting things to be able to draw upon depending on what we want to open in our psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have an almost unhealthy fascination with New York in the mid '80s and '90s. RICK RUBIN: You didn't live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but since I was a kid-- I went there when I was a little kid. And I was fascinated by it. There's also a very interesting migration of East Coast to West Coast creatives, including yourself, that played an important part in my life just seeing things and hearing things that were meaningful to me. But I, for instance, I love the movie-- I haven't seen the documentary about Jean-Michel Basquiat, Basquiat, because of the characters that are in it, and the huge number of people in that like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall, and on, and on. Those images of New York at that time are so exciting and what was happening. I wish I could transplant myself to that. If I had a time machine, that's where I'd land first. I hear a lot of people say, New York isn't what it used to be. San Francisco isn't what it used to be, whatever. LA isn't what-- there does seem to be something that feels a little bit disruptive to people about cities changing. But the idea that natural landscapes change is actually-- we even accept like, hey, fires sweep through places. And assuming they weren't started by humans, we accept that. That change and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy. And I always tell myself, you have the kids growing up in New York, or San Francisco, or Chicago now. They only know it that way. So to them, it's as cool or as uncool as it's ever going to be. They either want to get out or they're loving every piece of it. And this happened for all the people that came before us. So my question is a very basic one. Do you miss the New York that you came up in? Are you somebody who is attached to the past? RICK RUBIN: I'm not attached at all. I'm not attached to anything in the past. I don't look back at all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You don't think about, oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this. I miss-- no. Your optics are forward, present and forward. RICK RUBIN: Only present and forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there a process to that or it just happens to be where you default to? RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I'm not sure, but that's how I do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia is not in Rick Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I say that with genuine admiration. So you can hear a song that maybe you had a role in producing or not, something from the past. And you're accessing a state, presumably, but you're not pining for wishing how it was. RICK RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm no psychologist, but I'm going to venture to say that I think that's a very unique quality. I think a lot of people wish for or wish that things did not happen the way they did, that there's a lot of living in the past. There's a lot of this notion of people future trip. I don't actually think that's the default state of the brain. I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors to the past, good and bad. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I have none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And watching wrestling is one way that you cleanse the palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you go to a meal and you-- they pass around this or that-- I don't know if they do this anymore, but pass around a little bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate. It turns out there's a biological reason for that. There's a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors between savory, and sweet, et cetera. So wrestling is your palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: I know that if I watch wrestling before I go to sleep, it's going to be a good night's sleep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you dream about wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. But it's just relaxing. It's just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you anticipate when you watch it, like here comes the dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes when it happens it's exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's going up for the three-pointer. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes it's exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But do you enjoy-- RICK RUBIN: But even then, it's like the stakes are low. It's like I don't really care what happens, which feels good. I'm just being entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do they actually get hurt sometimes? You said they do. RICK RUBIN: A lot, often. They do. I mean, they're basically stunt men. So imagine stuntmen getting hurt doing a crazy stunt. It happens all the time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When the movie The Wrestler, I remember he got staples stapled into him. And I thought that's pretty intense. I once went and saw-- I guess they called it Mexican wrestling. I don't know if they call it that anymore, where the guys dip their hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, they dip their hands in glass. This was in Sacramento. And I once saw it. I honestly didn't have a stomach for it. I really didn't. I couldn't believe it was legal. It might not have been legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I thought-- RICK RUBIN: There's crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. So before sleep, is that typically when you watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you think it's useful for people to have some activity that allows them to clear their mind and create peace before heading off to sleep? RICK RUBIN: I think so. And I think yoga nidras would be good. It's like yoga nidra, pro wrestling, any of those type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching the Dahmer thing. I won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: I don't watch any horror, anything, or I don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I know it exists. I know horrible things happen in the world, but I certainly don't want to do that before sleep. I think these liminal states before and emerging from sleep are very powerful. When you wake up in the morning, are your thoughts immediately structured or do you enjoy the clearing of the clouds? RICK RUBIN: It's a slow process for me to wake up. And I like that. I like not engaging too much too soon. I usually fall asleep listening to a lecture or something speaking because if I don't, I can get caught in my own thoughts. And listening to something is enough of a focus point that it stops me from talking to myself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I do the same. My grandfather listened to the radio, to sports on the radio. And he would fall asleep. Oftentimes, he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth. His wife's responsibility was to stay up later than he did to make sure he didn't burn everything down. And then when you wake up, you said it's a slow process. Is it an hour or two before you feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: I would say probably an hour. I usually wake up and try to get in the sun as soon as I possibly can and hope to spend-- hope to spend about an hour. And then I'll usually go for a walk on the beach for another hour or 90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you with family members and other people at that time? RICK RUBIN: No, I'm usually focused by myself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: I'll be listening to something. I don't look at the phone, but I listen to, again, a lecture, or podcast, or audiobook. I like audiobooks a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do too. If an idea comes to mind do you write it down? RICK RUBIN: I may, it depends. I like to. I usually have-- would do a note in my phone. I don't usually carry pen and paper with me when I'm walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do the same. I do a long Sunday hike or jog. And I will audio script into my phone. People sometimes give me funny looks because I'm talking to myself. RICK RUBIN: That's a nice way to do it, though. I'd like to learn more of the audio methods of doing it instead of the typing methods. Right now I type and I don't think it's the best way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The voice memos function in the iPhone and other phones is really good. And there are now companies like rev.com that will turn those into Word docs scripts that are fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, they're not a sponsor of the podcast. I just happen to use it. It's great. I actually learned that trick from Richard Axel, the Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. He writes manuscripts by walking around his office, pacing, and talking into his phone. RICK RUBIN: I always think of the Woody Allen movie where the Alan Alda character is talking about-- yeah, he's speaking comedy ideas into the phone. It's really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I liked that movie about Harvey Milk, that Sean Penn played Harvey Milk, because that all took place before I was alive, mostly, in the Bay Area. But there's these beautiful scenes of him, as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table talking into a tape recorder at night, talking about how he predicted that he would be possibly assassinated, et cetera. And this goes back to the Strummer thing about writing things down. I think that a lot of people, including myself feel a little bit of egotistical guilt around, who am I to think that my ideas could be worthwhile or something? But I think over time, I've come to realize that the ideas about experiments or questions I have about health, they don't always, but oftentimes can lead to real seeds that grow into big trees. RICK RUBIN: But it's something that's interesting to you, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Most of my notes are not for anyone else's-- for anyone else's used. Like I hear about something that's interesting to me and I think about, OK, I want to learn more about this, whatever it is. And then, sometimes those things work their way into things I'm doing because the universe seems to work in that way, but I rarely am learning something with the idea of using it. I learn things with the idea of, this is what I want to know. This is what's interesting to me. And then often those things that are interesting to me can find their way into other projects just because they do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, that's almost like coal or kindling, but the moment that you think of it that way, it sounds so extractive. So you take this walk and you're writing down the occasional idea, perhaps. And then what is the next-- the way that-- here are less than, do this, then this, then that. I'm interested in, where does your mind shift to? Does it become more structured as the day goes on? Does your thinking become more structured around projects and plans? RICK RUBIN: I try to deal with things that need dealing with after that and in preparation for going to work. And then when I go to work, it's more like free-- this free thing where I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention, and maybe trying to will it to happen, but knowing I don't have the ability to make it happen. I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Some of the more surprising and I found really interesting and useful features of the book were about dancing with structure and lack of structure. So when I think of structure, I think of deadlines. So when you are in the process of creating something, obviously, deadlines are relevant, time of day. There's only so many hours in the day where one can stay in the groove or the readiness to receive. Have you ever found yourself in that mode where you're grinding like, oh, here we are. OK, I'm not coming home for dinner. It's the next-- we're going to push, put on the coffee pot kind of thing. RICK RUBIN: A lot. A lot. Over the course of my life, a lot, not as much now. And one of the things that I discovered through working on the book was the phases of work-- we're not required to treat the different phases of work in the same way, whereas before, I did. Before, everything was in this state of play. Everything had a wide open time schedule. It happens when it happens. And if it takes two years or three years, it doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's only about this thing has to be great. And what I came to realize in working on the book is that there are different phases. And the first phase is this seed collecting phase, which is an ongoing part of life in general. I do that. I do that always whether I'm working on something or not. I'm always in the seed collecting phase. And there's no deadline or just anything that interests me that I think I want to learn more about or has potential to be something, anything. I hear something, I think, uhm, I'd like to read more about that, or I wonder if there's a movie about that. Is there a movie about that? If not, maybe there's a movie to be made. Again, I want-- this is something I want in my life. Let's see if it exists. If it doesn't exist, then maybe that's something interesting to pursue. But I know that the desire is there because I have it. So in the seed phase, there's no deadlines. It's just a wide open part. And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase, where we start experimenting to see what the seeds want to do. You're involved but you're more of a-- you're not really dictating the action. You're setting the stage for something to happen, but it's not about you yet. So it'd be like the equivalent of you'd plant the seed. You'd would water it. You'd make sure it was in the sun. And you'd wait. So you're involved, but you can't make it grow. And then when it sprouts, and it grows, or if it turns into a plant, then you can look at the plants like, OK, how does this plant-- what's the potential of this plant? And then that the third phase is the crafting phase, where it's like, OK, I have this plant, maybe I'm going to trim it or maybe I'm going to combine it with these other plants to make something else with it. Now, it's like material that you have. And then finally is the completion or finishing phase, which is the final edit, getting to the version of it-- the version of it that's the one that you can share with the world if that's something you're going to do. And I've come to realize that by the time you're going into the completion phase, you can have a deadline. And it won't hurt the project. In fact, it might help the project. And I didn't know that before. So I've worked on projects that have gone longer than they necessarily needed to and maybe not in the best interests of the project because I didn't know that. I didn't understand the timing of that because I am so aware of the necessity in the experimental phase to not have a deadline that I assumed that held through the whole project. And they're not-- it's not a clear phase one finishes, and then you start phase two. Phase two finishes and you start phase three. You move back and forth between them. I'm collecting seeds all the time. I'm always in phase one. And then, probably to some degree, there's always some version of experimentation going on, maybe not now, but if something's on a list of things I want to look at, hopefully, I'll get to the list and give them some experimentation and see what they can turn into. And then if they do turn into something, then they get to the crafting phase where it's more, OK, now I have this thing. What do I know about this thing? What can I match this with? What can I use this for? How can I be involved as a craftsman? And by the end of the crafting phase or deep into the crafting phase, you can start seeing the end. You can start seeing an end. And then you can even dictate an end. But I recommend, if you do, just dictate it for you not for anyone else because if something comes up where you learn-- if you set a deadline, public deadline, and then a new discovery happens along the way. And you realize, oh, this could actually be much better than I thought, but I need more time, it's harder to do that if you set the deadline. So I would say, have an internal deadline to get to finish it. That said, if an unusual situation comes up and it's better for everything not to meet that deadline, it's one of those rules that-- you set the rule to break it if it's what's best for the project. But that was a new thing for me. And it helped me a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you realize that? RICK RUBIN: In collecting the material for the book and thinking about it. When I realized that it was phases-- I didn't know any of this. When I started writing the book, I didn't know hardly any of the things in the book. Most of it would be reverse engineering something that I had experienced, a successful experience using these methods without knowing they were methods, just following my instincts got me to something good. And then I would look back at, why did I want to do that? And is there a principle at play that could be of use outside of this case? And how do I explain that? And that's what the book is, these reverse engineered principles that have led to a good decision making and try and make things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The chapter on self-doubt was really interesting to me. RICK RUBIN: Tell me what it says because I can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'll read the first sentence of it, which is that self-doubt lives in all of us. And while we may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us. And it goes on to describe how to dance with self-doubt in not so many words. I think there's a saying that is actually from the landscape of psychology, which is generally discussed in a pathological context, which is, if nothing matters, anything goes. This is usually the phrase used to describe people who feel as if there's no use in living, so just go crazy, often to self destruct. But there's a light version of this, I realize, where in some sense the creative process seems to have something to do with-- if you're not paying attention to what outcomes are like who likes it, who doesn't like it, and you're just doing it for you, you make the rule play, I want to delight myself. Well then, anything goes and you have an infinite rule set there to extract from, at least initially. So as one gets better at their craft, you can imagine self-doubt goes down. I think that's the perception of a lot of people. You get better at what you're doing. You can land free throws as a basketball player. You can hit more home runs as a baseball player. You can produce more platinum albums as an artist. Self confidence goes up. Self-doubt goes down. But I think you and I both know a number of people who are successful enough to know that oftentimes there's a mirror image to that, where people feel pressure because they did it once now they got to do it again. RICK RUBIN: Yes or that you think you're so good at it that it comes easily and you don't have to apply yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. So self-doubt it's like a-- it's a check on yourself. It can either be really helpful or it can undermine you. So it's something we all have. And if we let it undermine us, then we don't make anything and that's not good. But when used as a balancing tool in our lives, it serves a great function where we really do-- it's OK to have all the confidence in the world and still second guess, is this the best it can be? You can doubt-- I think the phrase is in the book. You can doubt your way to a great work, to a masterpiece. Sometimes that questioning allows you to push further than just accepting, I made it so it's good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've encountered more people that seem to be driven by self-doubt and the need to constantly perform and perform again, then I have real arrogance. Just hasn't been my experience, fortunately. I've met some arrogant people in my life. And of course, we never-- as a psychiatrist who I admire a lot and bio-engineer who was a guest on this podcast Carl Di Saraf said, we never really know how other people feel. I mean, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel. Again, language is a very deprived format for explaining feelings. So we think somebody feels one way but we can observe-- and it could be another, but we observe their behavior. So in the sense of returning to the work, just always returning to process, it sounds like your routine is fairly scripted, at least now. But the things that you are getting in touch with-- wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean, there's a predictability of them because you can access them in a predictable way, but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them. The ocean is completely unpredictable. RICK RUBIN: I also listen to a lot of music that I don't know. So I listen to a lot of classical music, and less so but some jazz, and a lot of old music that I never heard before. And I like being surprised by music. And sometimes it really catches me off guard. I shazam a lot when I hear something I like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Have you ever encountered music that really works well live but just does not work in a recording? Or that it's much better live but the recording is sort of, meh. You don't have to name names. RICK RUBIN: I don't think so. I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live who've never captured it well on record. Example would probably be the Grateful Dead is a good example of a band where I feel like their albums are not their strong point. But if you hear live recordings, they're really interesting and really different from each other. And that's part of what makes the Grateful Dead interesting is their unpredictability. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I confess. I had a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead. And I got taken to a few shows when I was younger. And they would do that-- was it called space? It was these drum solos that would go on for hours and hours. This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows, where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds. And I remember thinking, what is this? What is this? But people I know, who love the Grateful Dead, love that uncertainty about where that drum thing-- I think they do call it space. Forgive me deadheads. I'm not enough of one to get it right. RICK RUBIN: But they're looking for something. And sometimes they find it. And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting because it's not just-- it's not just following a script. It's like something is really happening. It's a real moment. Something that I aim for in the studio is to create real moments that when you hear them, they don't necessarily sound perfect. They sound like something that really happened. And in that moment, something happened. And it's a special moment. And you can feel that if they were to play it again, it wouldn't be like that. There's something really exciting about that. It's really what-- it's how jazz works as well. And I think some of-- bringing some of that jazz mentality into other types of music is really interesting, makes for compelling things, because when you hear them, there's a certain amount of-- you really have to pay attention to do it. When you're doing it, you're really paying attention. It's like, I don't really know. There's no music. There's no map to follow. And now we're working together to make something. Do I play or not play? When do I play? And you're really paying attention. And can I add or you go to start adding something. And someone else added something. It's like, oh, I can't do that. And it's like everyone's just in this thing, in this moment experiencing this thing at once that you can feel as a listener. And we get to hear their excitement of finding it. And it's thrilling when it happens. So I like that experience. I feel that's what the Dead do live. They'll play songs in different ways. And again, I don't know very much about the Dead. It's newer for me to listen to the Dead. Growing up, I never listen to the Dead, but probably because I heard songs on their albums and thought, this doesn't really speak to me. But I think that the albums don't really reflect what's special about them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think a lot of their shows were recorded or videotaped-- RICK RUBIN: By fans which they supported. They supported that everybody come, everybody tape, everybody trade tapes. It made sense for who that band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They redefined or they defined-- excuse me, the notion of followers. I mean, people literally gave up their lives or spent much of their lives literally driving from city to city to follow them. RICK RUBIN: Because it's not like going from city to city to watch a movie over and over because it's not a movie. It's different every night. It's changing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's pretty incredible phenomenon. I don't know of anything else quite like it except cults. And those often don't end well. I think a guy that mixed the punch for the Jonestown Massacre went to my high school. RICK RUBIN: Is that true? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think so. RICK RUBIN: That's amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My sister is really good at all this '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. She's a very light person. RICK RUBIN: Did you read Season of the Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: It's about San Francisco in the '60s. It's great. You'll love it. Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I ought to check it out. The way you describe experiences going by in time, or things emerging in time, and the creative process being a way of capturing those moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera, I thought was beautifully captured in the analogy you gave about a conveyor belt going by of things. We think of the creative process like it's going to land in us, or we're going to enter it, or that we're going to sit there in a chair and grit our teeth. There's some Hemingway quote where you just sit there and stare at the page until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something, maybe it was him, maybe it was-- I don't know. It sounds like Bukowski or something. Anyway, I'm going to get this wrong. People tell me in the comments. Maybe no one said it. It was a dream. But I love this conveyor belt thing. That reminds me of being in laboratory, doing experiments thinking I was trying to solve one thing, and then seeing something else, and then having to make the decision, like is that really cool enough to drop everything and go that direction, or to spend a night, or a week, or a career going that way? I mean, these are big decisions, given that at least as far as we know, we're going to live 100 years or less. But this idea that we have thoughts and experiences in our past. And we can draw on, and try, and make good decisions-- do we grab these things off the conveyor or not? I'm hearing you. And I'm starting to realize that being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being able to make good decisions in this context, because we have a playbook of what's worked and what hasn't worked. But you actually talk about this-- there's a passage in the book that-- I'll just read it. To be aware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it's the way you've done it before. I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes, which is not something I do very often. Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit. I mean, we want to have mechanisms and routines we can trust, but this is, I think, an important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah when something works, it's easy to be fooled into believing that's the way to do it or that's the right way. It's just a way. And it's just a way that happened to work that time. And this plays into when you get advice from people who have more experience than you. You explain your situation. They tell you their advice. The advice that they're giving you is not based on your life or your experience. It's based on their life and their experience. And the stories that they're telling are based on experiences they've had, that have very different data points than yours. So maybe they're giving you good advice, but maybe they're giving you good advice for them and not giving you good advice for you. And it's easy when we try something and have a result, a positive result thinking, everybody can do this. The way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years. And then I started eating-- I started eating animal protein and then eventually changed my diet a few times to the point where I lost a lot of weight. The way that I did it worked for me. Right before that happened, I did something that I was told that everyone else who did what you did, they all lost weight, for whatever reason, I didn't. So the idea that we know what's right for someone else-- I think, it's hard enough to even figure out what's right for ourselves. And if we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us, be happy we have it, and then still know, I wonder if that's the only way. Maybe there's an even better way that we're not considering. Not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works just because we get the outcome we want. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was raised in science with a principle. It was literally dictated to me as a principle, almost like a rule of religion, which was that the brain is plastic. It can change and learn until you're about 25. And then the critical periods end and that's it. And this was a rule. Essentially, it was dictated a Nobel Prize, which was very deserved, given to my scientific great grandparents. They deserve it. But I was told there was no changing of brain structure function in any meaningful way after age 25 or so. It turns out that's completely wrong. Sorry David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong. RICK RUBIN: Wow, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, it was actively suppressed because of the competitive nature of prizes and discoveries at that time. And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student, Gregg Recanzone were showing that adult plasticity exists and only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme, just crazy. There were so many reasons and the textbooks said it. We were all told it. And it changed our behavior. Now we know this to be completely false. There's plasticity throughout the lifespan. There's limits to it here and there, but it's just far and away a different story. RICK RUBIN: So why would that be the only time that ever happened? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. But the field was run by a very small cabal of people at that time. RICK RUBIN: All fields are run by a very small cabal of people who have an investment in things being the way they are now because they're in charge. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one of the great things about getting older is that-- well, fortunately, everyone eventually ages. And I hope that-- David unfortunately passed away. He was lovely. Torsten is lovely. He's still alive. And they would say-- I think Torsten would say, yeah, we should have been a little more open or kind in allowing these other ideas. But I think that-- RICK RUBIN: But just think about all the years that were wasted with this misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. And it went beyond that. And there were BBC specials that helped propagate this. And one of the goals of the podcast has been to try and shed, shine light on ideas that at first seem crazy. I know you and I are both semi-obsessed with the health benefits of light. And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy. It sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something you would only hear about at Esalen or in Big Sur. Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood is based on really amazing work out of Columbia by a guy named Michael Terman. The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916, was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus. This idea that certain wavelengths of light can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea. But somehow, we see a red light. We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets and on stoplights. And somehow, it bothers people or it makes them feel like-- RICK RUBIN: It undermines a business model that doesn't take red light into consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Until it does and then it was-- and then it's co-opted there. And the place what I look to is acupuncture. For a lot of years, people said, well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism, no mechanism, no mechanism. There's a lab at Harvard, a guy named Qiufu Ma, who I reasonably well, whose laboratory is dedicated to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture. And they are discovering what everyone is known for thousands of years, which is that incredible effects on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN: I have a friend who was having a terrible back problem. And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist. And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested. And his back problem completely healed almost instantaneously. And I asked him, have you been keeping up, because he had another flare up. He's like, no. I can't go back there because acupuncture doesn't work. I said, well, you saw it work for you. He's like, yeah, but there's no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, he's got it-- now there's good science and published in premier journals. What's interesting is there's a little bit of science editorial, but since we like to exchange information about health and things of that sort, the editorial staff of a journal dictates what gets published and what doesn't. And the premier journals have an outsized effect on what the media covers. And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now is of the age that they grew up hearing about acupuncture, hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right, yoga nidra and similar practices. And so the tides are changing, but I sometimes like to take a step back and think, what are we confronted with now that seems crazy that in 10 years, the kids that will be the-- because to me they're kids, will be journal editors. I'm like, oh yeah, absolutely. I'm making this up but putting tuning forks against your head or something like that, like sound wave therapy. I think when one adopts a stance of-- we have to filter everything through the limitations of our biology, but also through the sociology, the way culture goes, it becomes a different story. How do you deal with that, not just in terms of health, but in terms of thinking about anything? It sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are going to think is cool or not. RICK RUBIN: No, I can't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're a punk rocker at heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You still are there, I got you. RICK RUBIN: I can't. I just know what I like and what I don't. I know what works for me and what doesn't. I try things. And I'm constantly looking for new better solutions to anything. And wherever they come from doesn't matter. It could come from-- it could come from Stanford or it could come from the guy talking to himself on the street. If it works, I'm good. It doesn't really matter to me at all. I don't hold any of it tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, there's now a division of the National Institutes of Health called complementary and alternative health. And it's amazing. NCCIH is run by a woman who has published on-- this is interesting, some of the anti-cancer effects of things like acupuncture, not that acupuncture can cure all cancers, but real data that I think for a lot of people, certainly of the generation above us, they just are not interested. It sheds new light on the Andrew Wiles, the Paul Stametses, the wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy, there are so many. There's so many we can look at. I mean for a long time, nutrition was just thought of as something that doesn't matter what you eat. It's what medicine you take and what-- the food is everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food is a powerful variable. In the landscape of online nutrition, it's one of the third rails for anyone like myself who's out there on social media. You do a very good job of putting out posts on Twitter and Instagram, but each day you take it down, you put up a new one. RICK RUBIN: And I don't talk about any-- I only talk about-- I talk about creative ideas. I don't talk about anything specific related to anything other than maybe something like, don't believe what you hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's right, exactly. Well, in the landscape of nutrition sometimes I now place it through the filter of professional wrestling. You've got your vegans, and your omnivores, and your carnivore MD. And you've got liver king. And you've got everything in between. So you could translate that to any number of different areas. Fashion probably has its people. I'm just not aware of who they are. Music has theirs. And sports has theirs. And science has theirs characters. So are we all just pro-wrestling characters in these different domains and we're taking ourselves and each other way too seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, it's all-- we don't know anything. If someone has an idea and it sounds interesting, do you try it. And if it doesn't work, it's OK and try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're an empiricist. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. And if something seems interesting to you and you're excited by it, why not try it? I try very fringy things. I like, in some ways, the more unrealistic it seems, the more interesting it is to me because I feel like that's getting closer to something that somebody doesn't want me to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But you're not a big drug guy like the big psychedelic craze that's happening now and that happened some years. RICK RUBIN: I'm not against it. It's just has never been something that I've done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting area that's definitely making headway inside of standard academic science and medicine now. RICK RUBIN: I'm interested in non-pharmacological approaches to things, whatever they are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm a big believer that also that behavioral do's and don'ts, first, are that they're the most fun to explore because, in general, unless it's something like jumping between buildings, doing parkour, or something, most of the time, you're not going to injure or harm yourself. There's more room for iteration than there is with a pill or a potion. Although, certainly, pharmacology has its place. So you've had creative works certainly within the realm of music, also comedy, and producing film, and other things. For somebody out there who, of whatever age, maybe they're creating, maybe they know they have this creative antennae, the sources outside. What was it that Strummer said? I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory. No input no output. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That Strummer's law. It's written in my laboratory. The people in my lab were like, what's going on here? I think one guy knew what that was, but it was a picture of him, and picture of my bull dog, and no input no output. I don't think I can just stay in a room with four walls, and a ceiling, and nothing else and create. I mean, I know that there are certain number of things in here, but I do think accessing the world is important. RICK RUBIN: And the world is giving us clues all the time. If we're paying attention, that's another part of it. If you're paying attention, the thing that you are looking for is being either whispered or screamed at you in the outside world if you're paying attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I forget the exact title of the chapter, but there's a chapter about staying open to clues or being on the lookout for clues. Now, I feel tempted to look for the exact title of that chapter. RICK RUBIN: It's probably look for clues is what I guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look for clues sounds like it sounds right. And since you wrote it, I'm guessing that's right. RICK RUBIN: Well it's something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think there are clues in everywhere? RICK RUBIN: Yes, I think there are clues everywhere. If we pay attention, we'll hear a phrase. It'll trigger a thought. We'll see something unexpected. If someone recommends something to you, maybe it's a coincidence. If three people recommend the same thing to you maybe it's not, who knows? Who knows? I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity. And the universe is supporting things to happen. And they can happen through you or they could happen through someone else. So if you're paying attention, maybe it'll happen through you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. He's an expert in the gut microbiome. And he applied something that-- without knowing, he applied the opposite principle, the opposite is true principle. We were talking about these trillions of gut microbiota that clearly are doing amazing things to create, neurotransmitters, and govern our brain, and even decision making, how much sugar is in our system driving appetite, et cetera. And he said, we think of them as cargo, but maybe we're just vehicles and they're in charge. That all of our interactions like every time we shake hands or touch our eyes, we're exchanging gut microbiota. And we think of intelligence as thinking and intelligence. And he's a microbiologist. And in all seriousness he said, maybe we're the ones being manipulated. We're the house cats. And we think here we are, we're falling in love, and kissing, and shaking hands, and washing hands, and doing all sorts of things to isolate or connect with one another. And maybe the gut microbiota are really trying to optimize their survival. RICK RUBIN: That's what Laird Hamilton said that at one point in the sauna-- that when you're in the sauna, it's really hot. The feeling that you have of wanting to get out could be the bad critters in your body that can't handle it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like let's get out of here. RICK RUBIN: Are trying to convince you, from the inside, to get out. Maybe that's where the feeling of being compelled to get out comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So Elon getting us all to Mars might be a bit of-- maybe they just want to get to Mars. And so they're RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I'm starting to feel like I'm channeling Lex Freedman here for a moment. No, I think this considering the opposite is really key. And while it might sound mystical to people or a little bit like we're just playing with ideas, that's exactly what you do in science. Someone walks in with a result and says, I found this. This is true. And you say, but what if it's all something else? A good example might be-- here I'm pulling from podcast episodes that we've had. But Alia Crum is this amazing psychologist who works on belief effects. Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome. And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said, what if all of exercise is placebo, all of it? Yeah, burn some calories and does some things. Turns out this isn't the case. But it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure, relieving stress, positive are placebo but nobody thinks of it like that because we're so attached to calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: I think that's a big point that the belief part of it is a huge part of the conversation about everything. What we believe has power. If we believe we can make something great, the chances of us making something great are better than if we don't believe we can. So I would say, any ability to harness your belief on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one thing that you make very clear is that while our own abilities may come into question from time to time, you absolutely believe that the elements from which to create are out there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. All the elements are here. Everything is here. We get to pick and choose. We get to-- the conveyor belts going by with the little gifts. And we can-- first, we have to notice there's a conveyor belt. Then we notice the gifts. And then that's the starting point. And then we may even feel empowered enough to grab one of the gifts, and open it up, and see what's inside. And then maybe that started something really beautiful that we wouldn't have done. Everything that I make or have made has always been based on something that I see or hear that allows me to see something that I didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I was going to ask you whether or not, it's important to be happy in order to create, but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy were still able to create. But the more I listen to you, it seems that it's really about an ability to pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy may not be as relevant as whether or not I'm able to stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. I would say that's-- I would say being able to stay present in the work is probably the most important part of it. And how you feel is less of an issue unless how you feel gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel. Do you know what I'm saying? If you're in a lot of pain and you're looking at a piece of art, it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel because you're-- the big signal in your body is the physical pain. I'm sure there are some people who can do that too, who can, even through the physical pain, can feel it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, there's this idea of transmutation, of taking one emotion and contorting it and co-opting it into another action in an adaptive way. But this idea of distraction being a problem, this really resonates, I think. When I think of times of great productivity is when I was able to be undistracted. I could also see how success can be its own distraction. This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports, where someone starts making a lot of money and pretty soon their focus becomes all the things they can access with their success as opposed to the thing that got them there in the first place. Keeping an underdog mentality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we conclude, I do want to ask you about one other aspect of process, which is meditation. Meditation is interesting to me because when we close our eyes as most meditations are done and we focus on our brain, our brain has no sensation. Like if we-- RICK RUBIN: I wouldn't say we focus on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or we focus on something other than our normal experience, is that-- how would you define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, there's different-- there are different types of meditation. Either way, I would say there is no form of meditation where we're focused on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. I'm glad we disagree. RICK RUBIN: I would say, here are the things that happen. We either are engaging in a mantra, which would be a version of almost creating a trance for ourselves, not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep that would distract our conscious mind from participating. We would be overriding the talking mind with just a sound that we're generating, or a word, or phrase, a series of phrases. Meta meditation is a loving kindness meditation with phrases, could be that or it could be focused on the breath. But the purpose of being focused on the breath is to not hear the self-talk that we normally have. It's a single pointed focus exercise in those that I described. The other version is an awareness meditation, where you're closing your eyes. And you're being with whatever is and noticing-- so if we were to do it now, and you could do it eyes open or eyes closed with an awareness practice. But the first thing that I would do is I would feel-- I feel a little ringing in my ears. It might be from the electronic equipment around us. And I don't mean that I hear the sound. It's like a vibration. I hear cars passing in the distance. Let's see what else comes out, I can feel a feeling in my chest. I can feel this part of my face. I'm not sure why. It feels like it's related to my jaw. More car sounds. I'm aware of a little feeling of warmth. So now, I would say the room feels a bit warm. I wasn't aware of that before, when I wasn't just being with what's happening. I feel a little itch on my left shoulder. So that would be an awareness practice, which is another kind of meditation where you're just paying attention to what's going on. There's no story. There's no this means this. None of those things. It's like an inventory, almost, of everything that comes up when it comes up. And you do that for a period of time. But in all of those cases, in the example of doing the awareness meditation, or doing a mantra meditation, or focusing on the breath, in none of them am I thinking. And none of them am I concentrating on-- I'm being aware of sense perceptions in the awareness one or in the other meditations. I'm doing a practice so that I'm not aware of thinking about anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you start meditating and how often do you meditate now? RICK RUBIN: I learned when I was 14. And I started with TM. And that's probably the meditation that I've done the most in my life and I come back to. Although I tried many different kinds and also different physical forms of meditation-- Tai Chi, things like that. I meditated for five or six years. And then I stopped when I went to school, to university. And then I started again several years later. And when I started again, I realized how profound it wasn't in me that I had done it when I did it So I usually have some sort of a practice. In some ways, the beach walks could be a form of meditation. But for me, typically, I would wake up. It'd be the first thing I would do during that in-between time, maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes, and meditate before starting my day. If I'm doing it twice a day, the second time would probably be right before dinner if I'm doing it on a regular schedule. Then if I find myself on an airplane, I might meditate for an hour. I can remember, one time, meditating the entire flight from New York to LA, just was a great opportunity to do a deep dive. And time passes. You lose track of time. You don't even know-- it's like going to sleep and waking up. You don't feel like that was eight hours. It's just time stops. Not always, but when it does, it's a great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, you've sent me some meditations including the one that you did on that transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. And I've been trying to get-- do longer and longer meditations, but I've always meditated a little bit. But your meditation practice is one that I'm starting to adopt, maybe we could convince you to give us a suggestions of one or two and we can link out to them for listeners. I'm sure they'd appreciate. RICK RUBIN: And there's also meditation like practices to do that involve-- there's something called the surgical series from the Monroe Institute which I used when I had a surgery. You listen to this recording. And it both allows your body to heal much faster and remove some of the trauma that goes on when getting cut open-- it's traumatic. But just through listening to certain things, you can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster. I remember I was about to be put under for a surgery. And my eyes were closed. And I wasn't communicating with anyone there because I was going inside. And my wife was with me. And they came in. And they said, oh, so they already gave Rick the sedative because he's ready to go in. I don't think you gave him anything. He's like, look at his numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Yeah, it's an amazingly powerful practice that I like because anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely, absolutely. And there's no good or bad version. It really is just-- if you learn a technique and show up and do it, it works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I love that you're so willing to share what you do in your process. Listen, I just want to say thank you for a number of things. I want to thank you for the music you've created and that you are to create because we want to be still ongoing, certainly for your time today in sharing your thought process and a bit of what goes into this incredible creative process. And I want to thank you for writing the book. I don't talk about or feature many books on the podcast. It's just not something we typically do, but I've seen a little bit of the evolution of it. And then I've seen it now and read through it in its final form twice, as I mentioned. And I'm going to continue to read through it again. It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems, like every chapter. I could take notes on this. And take notes on this. And it's assembled in a very digestible way that allows people to extract the meaningful parts in every chapter. And there are so many in a way that's very straightforward. So I love the book. So thank you for doing it because you certainly didn't have to write a book. But I'm so happy that you did. And I know that I've already benefited I know so many people are going to benefit. It's an amazing book. And I couldn't help but put my neuroscience lens on it. But I also, about halfway through, I learned to discard my pre-existing lens a bit and start to see things through what I think is a different perspective. So I just want to thank you for being such an incredible portal and also for being an amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. I love you. I'm so happy to be here with you. And any time I get to see you, it's a good day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Likewise. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Rick Rubin-- all about creativity and the creative process. Please also be sure to check out his new book, The Creative Act-- A Way of Being by Rick Rubin. As I mentioned earlier, it's an incredible book and such a wealth of knowledge for you creative types out there, for those of you that seek to be more creative, or to understand the creative process generally. And as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode, Rick has very generously offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions for Rick Rubin about creativity, or the creative process, or anything else for that matter, please put those in the comment section on YouTube by writing in capital letters, QUESTION FOR RICK RUBIN. And then please put the question in there. That will make it easier for me to find those questions. I will record the conversation where I asked Rick, those questions.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an ask-me-anything or AMA episode, which is part of our premium subscriber content. Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which still comes out once a week every Monday. And of course, is zero cost to consumer. The premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future. If you'd like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium and there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year. We also have a lifetime subscriber option. For those of you that are already Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers and you're watching and/or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium podcast feed. And for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode. And hopefully, that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber. Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible. The first question today is about adaptogens. Some of you may have heard of adaptogens. I'm guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens. The strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving. Meaning, no one really knows what adaptogens mean and what's included in adaptogens and what's excluded from adaptogens. But the most common definition of an adaptogen is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug. Although, it could be a behavior, if you really think about it, that helps you adapt to and buffer stress. So when you hear about adaptogens, there are three main categories of adaptogens that come to mind. The first are things that are contained in food. So these would be vitamins or micronutrients that one could easily find in food. But one would have to consume a fairly restricted number or type of foods in order to obtain those things, or consume a lot of those foods in order to get sufficient dosages of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress. Some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin, either water-soluble or fat-soluble, that can adjust or reduce what are so-called reactive oxygen species. And then that's what gives rise to this idea that antioxidants are good for us. Now, over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift. What shift has occurred? Well, about 10 years ago, you often heard about antioxidants, antioxidants, antioxidants and vitamins, antioxidants in this food, this superfood, et cetera. And why were people talking about antioxidants? Well, just to remind you, reactive oxygen species are types of reactions and molecules that occur in cells when cells get stressed and/or age. And antioxidants are the compounds that reduce those reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria, which are associated with energy production in those cells. So what do we know for sure? We know that as cells get older, or as any cell or biological system organ tissue, et cetera, get stressed a lot over time, the number of reactive oxygen species increases in those cells and tissues and organs. And antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins but also some micronutrients, are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species. Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years is that we know that reactive oxygen species are a major source of depleting cellular function by way of depleting mitochondrial function. But they are just one of many mechanisms that can deplete cellular function mitochondrial function. So nowadays, you'll hear about reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, but not as much as you used to. Now, you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines also being an issue. And the truth is all of these things are an issue. So going back to this question about adaptogens, adaptogens include these three categories. I've told you the first, which are the vitamins and micronutrients that are contained in food that can reduce reactive oxygen species and other aspects of cell or stress, such as inflammatory cytokines. What are some of those things that occur in foods? Well, in order to answer that, let's just think about what sorts of foods, themselves, can act as adaptogens. It's commonly held that the dark, leafy greens type foods, for those of you that eat plants. And I think the majority of people out there do eat plants. I know that the carnivore diet and lion diet and some other diets tend to exclude plants, and we'll address that briefly at some point in today's discussion. But dark, leafy greens are known to contain a number of compounds in the form of vitamins and micronutrients that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines. So if you're somebody who's interested in adaptogens and adaptogenic processes, reducing stress and buffering stress, which, of course, has its role in buffering daily stress in order to help you sleep better to improve cellular function for longevity sports performance, cognitive performance, that is all good and it makes sense why people would be interested in adaptogens. But remember that the two main adaptogens that you should think to first are going to be behaviors and nutrition. I started with nutrition on purpose. As I mentioned, we'll get to behaviors in a moment. So if you're interested in adaptogens at all, I highly recommend that you include at least two to four servings of dark, leafy greens and/or cruciferous vegetables per day. I think that would be highly advantageous. And just be aware that excessively heating dark, leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients that act in an adaptogenic way. That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli or cauliflower, just the thought of that makes me nauseous, it's very hard to digest. Some people might like that or can digest it more easily than others. So it's perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables and dark leafy greens, but you don't want to overcook them. What's overcooking and what's undercooking? There's no strict cutoff in terms of temperature. But basically, what the literature says is that if you heat vegetables to the point where the colored fluid is leaching out of them into a broth type, into water or whatever fluid surrounds them, well, then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well because it contained in the water or the fluid that's leaching out from the cruciferous vegetables or from the dark leafy greens, are going to be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules that you're interested in the first place. OK. So I probably surprised some people by starting off my answer to the question of "What are adaptogens? Are they worth thinking about in pursuing? And if so, how can I get them?" by talking about food. But I think it is important to understand that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food. And indeed, some of the best adaptogens do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that. The other two categories of adaptogens are going to be supplement-based adaptogens and then behavioral adaptogens. Again, here adaptogen defined as anything that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way in order to support cellular health, organ health, and overall daily living and functioning, including sleep and performance in mental health. So the second category of adaptogens are going to be supplements. And here, again, I just want to take a step back, make sure that we are clear about our operational definition about what a supplement is. We had an episode all about how to design a rational guide to supplementation, which included, for example, the idea that for some people, the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero. And for other people, the dosage will be something else. But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now, but a key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now is that many people think of supplements as just vitamin supplements. And for that reason, you'll often hear the argument, "Oh, well, aren't supplements just expensive urine. Couldn't you get all of that from food?" Aren't you just urinating out all the water-soluble vitamins and maybe even storing excess amounts of the fat-soluble vitamins in a way that's unhealthy or not cost-effective?" And so on. When we talk about supplements, yes, it can include vitamin supplements. However, there are many compounds that we would describe as supplements that are not vitamin supplements, and that you could not obtain from food or that you could never obtain from food in sufficient enough qualities to have a robust positive biological effect without consuming an enormous number of calories or overriding your gut mechanically. For instance, if there were, say, a herb, and we'll talk about such herbs in a moment, that contained an effective adaptogen, but you would never want to eat the plant itself or include that herb in any kind of recipe, well then, chances are this herb, which we'll define in a moment, is not a vitamin supplement. It is probably not even best thought of as a supplement, it's best thought of as a compound that sold over the counter, much like a prescription drug. Although, it's not prescription. It doesn't require a prescription to get it. So there are a lot of things like that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements. And unfortunately, because of that, a lot of people think, "Oh, you don't need supplements." And, of course, you don't need supplements per se, but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them. In the context of adaptogens, there are two or three in particular that can be very beneficial for buffering the stress response, especially, over short periods of time of about two to three weeks. So when would you use these? Well, for instance, if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life, either because of family or relational or school or work demands or new kid in the house or-- any number of different things, or you've been ill or you're recovering from injury, taking an adaptogen in the form of a supplement can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone and the general system is associated with, called cortisol. It's very healthy to have high levels of cortisol early in the day, shortly after you wake up. And then that ought to taper off toward the afternoon and evening. However, if cortisol is chronically elevated throughout the day, or if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late in the day, that is known to be associated with mental health and physical health issues. Has been shown by labs at Stanford and elsewhere. It's been shown in animal models and in humans. Talked many times before, and I'll just remind you again. One of the best ways to restrict that cortisol peak to the early part of the day is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can. Once the sun is up, get outside face in the direction of the sun, even on overcast days. Don't wear sunglasses, look at it for five to 30 minutes. Definitely blink so you don't damage your eyes, so on and so forth. Why five minutes or 30 minutes? Well, five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient, longer would be fine. Again, blink so that you protect your eyes. Blink as needed. Face in the general direction of the sun. On days when you have a lot of overcast or it's really dark, dense cloud cover, well, then, you'd want to be outside longer. And if you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason, then you want to do the same thing with bright artificial lights indoors, either so-called SAD lamp or otherwise. That's a great way to restrict that cortisol peak to early in the day. But even if you're doing that, if you have a stressful life for whatever reason, even if you're getting that morning sunlight, which I hope you are, you're getting your exercise, you're trying to sleep better and more as we all should most of the time, well, then you may be somebody who wants to take a adaptogen in the form of a supplement. And the three supplements that can be very effective in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha, which I'll talk about first, lion's mane and chaga. Lion's mane and chaga are in the fungi group, so they count as mushrooms. They are not psychedelic mushrooms. Let's talk about ashwagandha first. Ashwagandha is at the top of the list because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen. How can I say that? Well, there are a number of studies now, including several excellent ones in humans, that report that taking two doses of 300 milligrams of ashwagandha per day can, very dramatically, buffer cortisol. So this is something that you would have a near-impossible time accessing from food. I can't imagine that, unless you're cooking with the very sources of ashwagandha and extracting exact amounts that you'd be able to get this in any other form except supplement form. So here I'm going to just briefly reference a paper and we can provide a reference link to this, that is. This is a paper from 2012 that's had a lot of excellent follow-up papers that support it. The title of the paper is A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of high concentration of full spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults. And it's a really nice study. Not a huge subject pool, but both men and women, and has carried out for long enough that they got to see some really interesting results. And I think the most interesting result is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day led to enormous-- I mean, just enormous changes in serum cortisol. The statistical significance that they observed in the study was really fantastic, fantastically high statistical significance. They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15, having initiated the ashwagandha consumption on day one, of course, day 30 and day 45. And again, this was dramatic reductions in stress as perceived by people. So subjective stress and cortisol levels. So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol. How would you recapitulate this if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress? Well, a couple of key points. I mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak to come earlier in the day. Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol early in the day. In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day provides an anti-inflammatory immune-supporting, focus and mood supporting effect all day long. So I would recommend that people take their first dose of ashwagandha anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams. Sometime in the early afternoon and again in the evening, as opposed to taking a morning dose in an afternoon dose. Also, if you're somebody who's exercising for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy, the growth of muscles or strength, or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance or more traditional cardiovascular endurance, then I recommend that you not take your ashwagandha prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise. Sort of in the same way that some of the best adaptations to exercise are reductions in blood pressure and resting heart rate. And those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate during exercise. That's just how these biological systems work. So the takeaway is pretty simple. If you're interested in using ashwagandha as an adaptogen, I would restrict it to later in the day if you can and not before exercise. Divide it into two doses of 250 to 300 milligrams. That's what this paper and other papers like it seem to indicate. And then a very important final point about ashwagandha, which is that if you're going to take ashwagandha, I recommend not taking it for longer than a month-and-a-half as they did in this study. In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha around periods of moderate to extreme stress. What's moderate, what's extreme is going to depend on what you're going through. Only how much stress and life events you can tolerate. So if you've had trouble sleeping and that's unusual for you. Or, you're dealing with a very difficult life circumstances or excessive work demand, or a new kid, as I mentioned before. Well, then buffering stress with ashwagandha, buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening can be very beneficial for you. But then I would say after about 30 days maximum, I would take at least two to four weeks off. Two weeks is probably enough, but four weeks off because you don't want to chronically buffer cortisol. It's just not a good idea. But that said, I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen. I would place at the top of the list of supplement-based adaptogens. But keep in mind that even if you're taking a supplement-based adaptogen, that's no reason to abandon the nutrition and behavioral type adaptogenic effects that you can create through eating dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, then we'll talk about the behaviors in a moment. The other two supplement-based adaptogens, as I mentioned, are lion's mane mushroom and chaga. And I get asked a lot about lion's mane and chaga for sake of their purported roles in acting as nootropics as quote unquote "smart drugs." There are fewer data on the beneficial roles of lion's mane and chaga for sake of nootropic effects-- we'll do an entire episode on nootropics at some point. But there have been a few studies showing that lion's made in supplementation and chaga supplementation can improve memory, and maybe even divergent thinking associated with creativity and things of that sort. Again, these are not psychedelic mushrooms. That said, there are good data showing that 1,000 milligrams, that is 1 gram, of lion's mane per day and/or-- I will talk about the end/or portion in a moment, and/or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1,500 milligrams per day can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol. But also and mainly reducing some of the anti-inflammatory cytokines that are known to circulate in high abundance when you're under a lot of psychological and/or physical stress. Things like interleukin 6 and some related molecules. So here's what I would recommend. If you are interested in exploring adaptogens, I'm a big fan, as some of you probably know, if you heard that episode on rational guide to supplementation. I'm a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements in single-ingredient formulations so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you, and so that you can toggle in and out those adaptogens as needed. So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends and mixes, the one that we talk about a lot on this podcast and we have been a sponsor from the beginning, I've taken for a decade now long before I ever had a podcast, is Athletic Greens, which some of you might note does contain some ashwagandha. Although, the levels of ashwagandha that are contained in Athletic Greens are low enough that I don't see any issue with taking Athletic Greens consistently, day to day, every day, because you're not getting anywhere near that 600-milligram dosage. But the idea is that if you were going to take any adaptogen for sake of buffering stress over the short term, say for a week or two weeks or a month, and then taking that recommended time off, I would start with ashwagandha. And then if you feel you need something else to buffer stress, keeping in mind, of course, that you're doing the behavioral and the nutritional things to buffer stress as well. You can never abandon those, right? Well, then I would suggest adding 1,000 milligrams or 1,000 milligrams of chaga per day and seeing how that further benefits your system in terms of buffering stress. How would you measure if your stress is being reduced? Well, you're going to be sleeping better at night. You're going to feel subjectively better, lower levels of anxiety. All the things that are measured in the types of studies I described before. Now, of course, there's nothing preventing you from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha, a gram of lion's mane, and a gram of chaga. I know some people like to just kind of go full tilt into everything. But I am a big believer in really trying to isolate which supplements and molecules work best for you and which ones don't. Do you need to cycle on and off lion's mane and chaga? I'm not aware of any data showing that you do. If, however, you're taking them every day, I recommend that you cycle off them after a period of 30 days or so. And I want to be very clear about this, just because I said cycle off after a period of 30 days or so does not mean that you can't take them for a shorter period of time. So for instance, if you know that you're coming up on a big week of stress, well, then you could take ashwagandha and/or lion's mane and/or chaga for that week or just that week or heading into that week or in the following week and then stop. There's no reason why you couldn't take them even just for one day. Although, the effects tend to be a bit cumulative, at least, when we're talking about buffering anxiety. In terms of buffering cortisol, that's a very potent effect that as far as we know, is going to take place on day one. Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect away from exercise. At least, don't take it before exercise. And try and buffer your cortisol in the afternoon and evening, and this is assuming that you're working a conventional shift and you're not up all night and sleeping all day for sake of shift work. So hopefully, that clarifies things about what adaptogens are. In fact, I never actually read the specific question, but I think I've touched on a number of issues that were related to the specific question. And then I'll answer the last portion of the answer to this question in a moment, as it relates to behavioral tools that can act as adaptogens. The question, itself, was there's a lot of mixed information out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha. And I think that relates to what I said earlier, which is that the definition of an adaptogen has not really been cemented in various communities. It's different in different communities, and it's generally used as a matter of convenience rather than really strictly defining what it is. And hopefully, we've defined it accurately and broadly enough today as something that buffers stress. The second part of the question was what does the scientific evidence say about adaptogens and their ability to mediate body stress response? They say quite a lot, and they say that the stress response can be buffered substantially by certain adaptogens. Mainly, dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga, and of course, all the behavioral things that are critical that I will list off in a moment. And then the third portion of the question is, is there any solid evidence that has an effect on neurotransmitters or the HPA, which is part of the stress modulation access? The best evidence is that adaptogens can reduce cortisol itself. There is very little evidence that adaptogens can directly modulate neurotransmitters or neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera. But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol, especially in the afternoon and evening, that is going to have indirect effects on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera, and serotonin. But not direct effects. So the general contour that makes for an ideal diurnal schedule-- you heard of nocturnal, well, the opposite that is diurnal, being awake during the daytime and asleep at night. The ideal kind of landscape of neurotransmitters is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the early part of the day and cortisol, so-called catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. And high levels of cortisol early in the day as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine, hydration, movement, all that stuff, being awake and busy and outside or indoors with bright lights and moving about in the early part of the day and into the early afternoon, that's the best possible way that we are aware of to try and get those catecholamines released at the highest levels in the early part of the day. And then the ideal contour of a 24-hour cycle will be in the later half of the day. The evening and nighttime, you have higher levels of things like serotonin the GABAergic system, all the things that are somewhat sedative in preparing you for sleep and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol as I described before. So to directly answer the question, "Is there any evidence that adaptogens can alter your neurotransmitters?" Yes, but only indirectly. And yet, that indirect control over neurotransmitters is substantial and is important. And if you do what I described, such as getting morning sunlight and ideally, you'd get a little bit of deliberate cold water exposure, by the way, to boost adrenaline and norepinephrine and dopamine, those catecholamines early in the day. So quick one-minute cold shower, even or a three-minute cold shower, or if you have access to an ice bath early in the day, plus some sunlight, doesn't matter which one you do first, doing that early in the day is really going to create that peak of cortisol, dopamine, epinephrine early in the day. I can't emphasize how beneficial all of that can be. And exercise, if you can, early end of the day. Some people can't exercise till later in the day. I'd rather see people exercise later in the day than not at all, provided it does not disrupt their nighttime sleep, which of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So yes, there is modulation of neurotransmitters, but most of those are downstream of the effects on cortisol that we've been talking about. So we've defined nutritional adaptogens, supplement-based adaptogens-- although, I don't really like the word supplements anymore unless we're talking about vitamin supplements for reasons we talked about earlier. And then there's the third category of adaptogens, which are the behavioral tools that you can use to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen. I think it's really important that we always keep in mind that yes, there are supplements, yes, there are prescription drugs out there. In fact, there are prescription drugs that you can get from a doctor that will potently zero out your cortisol. But most doctors are very reluctant to prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides a very important and functional role early in the day. Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol. What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol? Well, we talked about, one, to restrict cortisol the early part of the day, which is viewing morning sunlight. But how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon? It's going to be all the things associated with reducing stress. For instance, 10 minutes or even-- my laboratory and other laboratories have shown is even five minutes a day of just what would be called mindfulness meditation, very simple. You don't need to overcomplicate this. You could use a great app like the Waking Up app or another app of the sort. Or, you can simply sit down, eyes closed, breathe through your nose, and just concentrate on your breathing. Every time your mind drifts to something else, bring it back to your breathing. That's shown to reduce stress. You could do a five-minute deliberate breath work practice. My laboratory has published some work related to that. The breath work practice could be any number of things. The two that I recommend the most would be double inhale, followed by a full exhale, and then repeat for a period of five minutes. Known to substantially reduce anxiety, stress, and the various physiological systems associated with arousal. You could also use box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations for a period of five minutes, will substantially reduce stress. I'm a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra, which involves no movement. It involves just lying there, listening to a script. Lots of yoga or scripts available online. If you're not interested in the intentions and other things, including yoga nidra, you can buffer stress using an adaptogen like NSDR, non-sleep deep breast. If you're interested in trying these sorts of things. There's a NSDR protocol that's 10 minutes long. Just put my name, Huberman, and NSDR into the search browser on YouTube. And Virtusan is provided in NSDR that's completely zero cost and works very well for reducing stress. It will also help teach your system and teach you how to learn to fall asleep better at night. So any of those practices, five to 10-minute breathing practice or meditation, or a NSDR yoga nidra. If you can do longer 20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon, that's known to buffer cortisol substantially as well. Any time you're encountering stress in real time, I highly recommend a tool over and over because it's so effective. The fastest way we to buffer stress and calm down is the so-called physiological sigh, big Inhale through the nose till your lungs are empty, but then sneak in a little bit more air by second inhale, maximally inflate the lungs, then a long exhale until you're lungs are empty. One to three of those will reduce your stress substantially. Over time that should reduce, that is, buffer your cortisol acting as an adaptogen. There are a lot of things. You can take a hot bath, you could take a hot shower, you can listen to some pleasant music. Anything that reduces your stress, technically, is an adaptogen. So I hope I've thoroughly answered your question by yours-- I mean, of course, this answer is going out to all of you. This is a question that was asked by Justine Bevilacqua. I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine. And thank you for that question. I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens. So now, you can use nutrition such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens. And I should also mention, if you're not ingesting enough calories each day, well, then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress. That's not to say that some people shouldn't take in fewer calories than they burn in order to lose weight, some people really need to do that for their health or for whatever other reason. But if you restrict calories too much, you are going to increase cortisol output. So keep that in mind. So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals. Aim to get dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, don't overcook them. If you want to explore supplements, the best supplements to act as adaptogens are going to be ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga. One or two or three of those-- although, if you're going to pick one, I'd recommend ashwagandha, 600 milligrams per day, taken in the later-half of the day. And then there are the behavioral tools that we just talked about now, which are anything that reduces stress can reduce cortisol. And in doing so, are technically adaptogens. If you want to know more behavioral tools and other tools for adjusting stress and learn more about adaptogens, we did a whole episode called Mastering Stress. So you can look to that-- that episode also pretty clearly defines, I like to think, what short-term, medium-term, and long-term stress really are. Keep in mind, stress is part of life. Learning how to work with it, how to dance with it, how to buffer it is terrific. But zeroing out cortisol is not the goal. The goal is to learn to modulate and control your cortisol, and that's really what adaptogens are all about. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask-me-anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask-me-anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research in particular research done on human beings. So not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to, specifically, fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools, for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Human Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMA's. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMA's and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes, and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-01-09 13:00:35 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing supplements or more specifically a rational guide to supplementation now to be forthright I want to tell you that I am not a fan of the word supplements because it stems from this idea that all supplements are somehow food supplements or designed to compensate for what one could otherwise get from food and that's simply not the case many supplements are compounds that are extremely efficacious for instance for enhancing sleep or for enhancing hormone function or for enhancing focus and many of those compounds are simply not found in food or are not found in enough abundance in food to have the desired effect now that raises the issue as to whether or not these compounds are good to take safe to take and whether or not they are actually beneficial for us and the short answer is that like everything else supplements can either be good for us or dangerous for us depending on dosage sourcing Etc but more importantly we need to think about supplements and a rational guide to supplementation as taking into account a number of different factors and we need to set aside the idea that all non-prescription compounds that fall under this umbrella term supplements are simply things that could be extracted from food but most people don't either ingest enough of those Foods or pay enough attention to their diet in order to obtain them in fact during today's episode I'm going to give you a number of different very specific questions that you can answer in order to decide whether or not you should be taking any so-called supplements or not and whether or not you should be taking one type of supplement or another type of supplement more or less than the other I'm also going to discuss safety of course and I will discuss cost because obviously monetary cost is a serious consideration for most if not everybody considering the use of supplements during today's episode I will also discuss which specific supplements are optimal for achieving specific endpoints such as improved sleep such as improved focus and such as improved hormone function among other things I plan to cover the full range of what I referred to as supplements including so-called foundational supplements that are designed to act as a sort of insurance policy against any deficiencies that might exist within your diet all the way up to very targeted outcome supplements and compounds that is compounds that are non-prescription that are designed to achieve very specific endpoints such as enhanced Focus over the next four to six hours of physical work or mental work so on and so forth plan to cover everything in between that as well and I promise to cover how supplements interact with other things such as behavioral tools prescription drugs when supplements might be a good alternative to prescription drugs when they might not be a good alternative to prescription drugs when supplements can serve as an augment to already excellent nutrition and prescription protocols and every feature of supplements as it relates to mental health physical health and performance by the end of today's episode you should be armed with a number of different questions as I mentioned before that will allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost-effective supplement regimen for you and of course I want to acknowledge that for some people the total amount or dosages of a given supplement were supplements that you might need to take could be zero there are such individuals but that many people can in fact arrive tremendous benefit from supplements in a way that can be more cost effective than trying to obtain the same non-prescription nutrients from food as we head into today's conversation I want to emphasize something very important not just as it relates to supplements but as it relates to all aspects of mental health physical health and performance and that is I take the stance that behavioral tools that is specific actions that we take and specific actions that we avoid form the foundation of mental health physical health and performance so things like viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools they don't require the ingestion of anything within the realm of Behavioral tools there are also some don'ts or do not that can greatly enhance our mental health physical health and performance such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of 10 pm and 4 AM or avoiding caffeine too late in the afternoon because even if you can fall asleep after ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon we know it disrupts the architecture of your sleep in ways that greatly diminish your mental health physical health and performance the following day for instance so behavioral tools form the foundational layer of all tools for mental health physical health and performance second to that I would say the next layer is in fact nutrition no amount of supplementation or non-prescription compounds or prescription compounds for that matter can never compensate for poor nutrition at least not for very long okay so this is a key Point even though many supplements are not simply food supplements because they are not designed to compensate for anything that you could otherwise get from food that is not to say that you can live on supplements you know I suppose you could live on whey protein and fish oil capsules and vitamin capsules or tablets for a short while but before long you'd either suffer from boredom to the extent that you'd want to go back to food or some other deficiency would show up I think it's the rare individual that tries to survive entirely on food supplements and things of that sort most everybody and I would hope everybody is paying attention to their nutrition so I would Place behavioral tools do's and do Nots as layer one the deepest layer the Bedrock of all mental health physical health and performance on top of that I would Place nutrition and of course that's going to mean different things to different people with the understanding that there's a huge array of different food choices and nutritional programs nutrition is fundamentally important for macronutrients for storage of energy in the form of glycogen fats and phosphocratine stores and so forth but also for obtaining basic nutrients vitamins minerals and micronutrients Okay so we've got behavioral tools nutritional tools then on top of that I would place what is typically called supplementation although today I'm trying to expand that word to include not just things that compensate for food deficiencies or that are layered on top of food as a way to enhance the amount of nutrients that you could get from food but as I mentioned before compounds that are non-prescription that can be for a variety of different purposes and many of which are not available in food so I would place supplementation right on top of nutrition then past that I would say prescription drugs obviously prescribed from a board-certified MD can serve a very vital purpose in the treatment or augmentation of mental health physical health and performance goals so some people do in fact need prescription antidepressants other people do not some people do in fact need prescription drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or sleep Related Disorders so on and so forth the whole issue of whether or not there is an over prescription epidemic or not um is a separate conversation for a separate podcast I would argue that many prescription drugs do in fact save lives this includes the category of prescription drugs related to statins and cardiovascular health related to any number of different things even sleep disorders and insomnia narcolepsy and so forth that said there are many instances in which people can either reduce their dosages of prescription compounds or can replace those prescription compounds with quality behavioral tools nutrition and supplementation but there are many instances in which prescription drugs are the only route by which people can achieve the mental health physical health and performance goals that they wish to achieve so I would place that as the fourth layer in this stack of layers directed towards mental health physical health and performance so just to list off again I fundamentally believe that behaviors do's and do Nots form the foundation of mental health physical health performance and next in line would be nutrition that is the specific Foods we eat the amount that we eat the combinations of foods that we eat in a given sitting and the timing in which we eat our food then on top of that I would Place supplementation the topic of today's episode and finally prescription drugs and of course all of these things interact in important and interesting ways many of which interactions we will discuss during today's podcast as we drill into the topic of supplementation developing a rational supplementation protocol and one that is most biologically and cost effective before moving further into today's episode I want to emphasize a very important point which is that I am not a physician that is I'm not a clinician so I do not prescribe anything nor am I going to do that today I'm a professor I review the research literature I describe tools gleaned from the research literature and developed from the research literature so I profess many things but I do not prescribe anything and I think it's vitally important that anytime you are thinking of adding or subtracting any behavioral protocols nutritional protocols supplementation based protocols and certainly prescription drug based protocols for whatever purpose that you consult a trusted board-certified physician that's absolutely essential I don't say that merely to protect me I mainly say that to protect you the most important aspect of today's episode is not going to be that you discover one particular supplement or category of supplements or blend of supplements that is going to transform your mental health physical health and performance no the purpose of today's episode is for you to understand where you have needs that can be met by supplementation better than any other approach and most importantly how to think about supplementation that is how to think about the different categories of supplements that are out there and how those interact with your nutrition and your behaviors so that you can maximize your immediate and long-term health what I mean by this is that we have this word supplements or supplementation but that means many many different things it means vitamins it means minerals it means adaptogens most people probably don't even know what an adaptogen really is and in fact many people talking about adaptogens never actually Define what an adaptogen is or designed for or the fact that many adaptogens are also used for other purposes so today's discussion is really about you learning how to think about supplementation the same way you would learn to think about nutrition or exercise or anything related to brain and body health for that matter in a way that lets you navigate this vast space that we call supplementation and develop protocols that are optimal for you and indeed it may be the case that the ideal dosage of a given supplement for you is zero milligrams for instance if I ask you are you sleeping deeply and enough each night do you feel rested throughout the day maybe you need a short nap and that's it or maybe you don't and you say yes I feel great I sleep great I wake up feeling great I only need a short nap or no nap during the day to feel rested throughout the day well then there's really no discussion about sleep supplementation to be had between you and me however if you are not sleeping well then a big discussion opens up as to what the reasons are as it relate to nutrition or when you're exercising or ingesting caffeine in other words no discussion about supplementation can be had in a vacuum rather discussions about supplementation need to be considered in a larger context so today you're going to learn how to place the discussion and thinking about supplementation in a larger context and think about how specific supplements that is specific ingredients and combinations of ingredients can indeed be used to buffer and support your overall health and lead you to specific health and performance outcomes before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality the huberman Lab podcast has decided to partner with momentous because of the extremely high quality of momentous supplements and because they have single ingredient formulations as we'll discuss more on today's episode single ingredient formulations are essential for most all aspects effects of developing a rational highly efficacious supplement regimen and that's because the ideal supplement regimen allows you to adjust the dosages of individual ingredients as well as alternate days in which specific ingredients are consumed it also allows you for instance to assess whether or not one given ingredient works for you and another ingredient does not and it also allows you to assess whether or not any side effects originate from a specific component of your supplement protocol another advantage of momentous supplements is that they ship anywhere in the world because we realize that many of you reside outside of the United States if you'd like to try any of the supplements mentioned in today's or other episodes of The huberman Lab podcast so for instance things related to sleep augmentation hormone augmentation enhancing Focus metabolic health or otherwise you can go to live momentous spelled ous so livemomentis.com huberman and you'll get 20 off any of their products today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of sodium magnesium and potassium the so-called electrolytes and no sugar getting sufficient hydration and electrolytes is key to brain health and body health and that's because every cell in your brain and body relies on having enough electrolytes available in order to function this is especially true of the so-called neurons or nerve cells in your brain they actually require sufficient amounts of sodium and potassium and magnesium but especially sodium and potassium available to them in order to fire what are called Action potentials or electrical signals that's what allows you to think to feel to move what gives you energy so on and so forth so when you are dehydrated oftentimes you will need to get electrolytes and that's true if you're exercising a lot or if you sweat a lot but for many people it's just true because they're not consuming enough water and electrolytes in the form of liquids and Foods throughout the day element contains a science

mattresses and pillows that are absolutely phenomenal I've been sleeping on a helix mattress for close to two years now and it's the best sleep that I've ever had one of the reasons is the mattress is customized to you so you simply go to the Helix site you take a brief two minute quiz it asks you questions like you tend to sleep on your back your side of your stomach or maybe all of those across the night or maybe you don't know you tend to run hot during the night or cold during the night or maybe you don't know and they match you to the ideal mattress for you for me it was the dusk dusk

get up to 200 off and two free pillows let's talk about supplements and supplementation and how to develop a rational supplementation regimen one of the things that's really emerged over the last 20 years is that supplements and there I'm referring to non-prescription compounds designed to augment nutrition prescription drugs and behavioral protocols have emerged as a Mainstay within the health and wellness but also the medical communities that are focused on developing mental health physical health and performance for their patients and their athletes and for the everyday person essentially what I'm saying is that 20 years ago a discussion about supplements would mainly take place within the niche communities of health food stores or particular athletes but nowadays I think almost everyone is familiar with the fact that yes indeed there are standard vitamin supplements but that there are also supplements such as Vitamin D3 which are designed to make sure that people have certain amounts of hormones in their bloodstream because they might not be getting enough Sunshine although I'll be very clear over and over throughout this episode that there is no pill replacement for Sunshine nor is there a pill replacement or food replacement for that matter for exercise or for social connection or for sleep or for simply getting smarter again there is no pill that's going to replace excellent behavioral protocols in fact a physician friend of mine has a great saying that I think everybody should keep in mind as we wade into this conversation which is that Better Living Through Chemistry still requires Better Living I think that's a very important phrase to keep in mind when thinking about the optimal supplementation or prescription drug protocol for you so what is an ideal supplementation protocol well I think what we need to do is to take a step back and ask what are different supplements designed to do for instance there are foundational supplements these are supplements that are designed to establish a foundation or provide Insurance along with your nutritional intake to ensure that you're getting all the things that you need in order to have a basic level of mental health physical health and opportunity for Optimal Performance now this is the one category of supplements for which I think it's appropriate and in fact advantageous to have multiple ingredients in a given supplement throughout the rest of today's discussion I'm going to talk about the advantage of mainly focusing on taking single ingredient formulations for a variety of reasons but when it comes to foundational supplements what we're mainly talking about are supplements that contain vitamins and minerals that are designed to compensate for any deficiencies you might have from diet or from lack of adequate diet how would such a lack of vitamin and mineral intake arise well for instance if you're somebody that practices intermittent fasting or other components of fasting or if you're somebody who does not get enough vitamins and minerals from vegetables and fruits and Grains and meats well then taking a supplement that can act as a insurance policy against any vitamin mineral deficiencies in many ways can be advantageous although I will talk about some of the safety concerns in just a few minutes now I want to acknowledge that as soon as we talk about vitamin mineral supplements the Skeptics immediately raise their hands and say well all that vitamin and mineral supplements do is give you very expensive urine and there the Skeptics are referring to the fact the reality that when you ingest high levels of water-soluble vitamins so think vitamin C and some of the other vitamins that indeed you will excrete them in your urine however it's also the case that many people are not getting enough of the water-soluble vitamins from their foods and it's also the case that many people are and it's also the case that ingesting higher than needed amounts of most water-soluble vitamins provided those levels aren't exceedingly High is or at least we should say can be safe and again this is provided that the levels that they're ingesting are not exceedingly high so the typical vitamin mineral supplement is indeed going to cover any gaps or deficiencies that might arise in the water-soluble vitamins from your food intake but the reality is that most people are getting enough of the water-soluble vitamins from their food if they are paying attention to a couple of things and those things are very simple to lay out regardless of whether or not you're a vegan a vegetarian a more traditional omnivore eating from both animal-based and plant-based sources grains Etc or even if you're in the pure carnivore or strict I guess it's called The Lion diet where it's just meat and salt regardless of what type of nutrition you follow you will get vitamins and minerals but you'll get more or fewer of them depending on the nutritional program you follow and of course depending on how often and how much you eat that's just sort of obvious most people who take a vitamin mineral supplement will indeed excrete a lot of the water-soluble vitamins they will retain the fat soluble vitamins and there again the Skeptics will raise their hands and say you do not want to take high levels of fat soluble vitamins because they will be stored in your system potentially to levels that are dangerous again provided that vitamin mineral supplements are not taken in excess it's unlikely that you're going to have such a buildup of the fat soluble vitamins in your system that they're going to be a problem so that raises a very specific question that you need to ask do you want to take a vitamin mineral supplement well the answer to that will be highly individual but you really just need to address two things first of all is the cost within the range that you can afford and want to pay right oftentimes these vitamin mineral supplements can be quite inexpensive but some of them can be quite expensive and you can see the full range of ones that are pennies per day all the way up to many dollars or tens of dollars per day because of what are reported to be variations in quality and sourcing and so forth I'm not aware of any real differences between the quality of the water soluble and fat soluble vitamins found in the less expensive versus the more expensive vitamin mineral supplements more typically the cost scales with the dosages of these different vitamins and minerals and as could probably be expected the more expensive to obtain and source vitamins and minerals tend to be in lower quantities in the less expensive versions of vitamin mineral supplements that's just kind of obvious so you need to ask yourself can you afford it financially and then you need to ask yourself are you able to regularly ingest enough foods with enough variety to cover your vitamin mineral needs just from food and for some people the answer is going to be an immediate yes they are careful to get enough of the foods that allow them to obtain their vitamin and mineral quota and for other individuals the answer will be no I would say for people that are extremely physically and or mentally active and for people that perhaps are following a intermittent fasting schedule so they are not ingesting a lot of food in general or restricting their food intake to specific times of day well then a vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense for them however it's going to be very important to ingest that vitamin mineral supplement with food and ideally early in the day so that can set up a little bit of a challenge for the intermittent fasters who are restricting their feeding window to late in the day why do I say this well many of the water-soluble vitamins in particular the B vitamins need to be ingested with food because otherwise they can cause some stomach upset and again there's a range there some people like myself can take B vitamins on an empty stomach and feel fine other people feel really lousy when they take B vitamins there are a few other things that we'll talk about later namely zinc and coenzyme Q10 that really should also be taken with food but the best time to take a vitamin mineral supplement is with food and I believe that if you're going to take a vitamin mineral supplement that you want to take it with food and you don't want to take dosages of vitamins and minerals from supplements that are exceedingly high for a couple of reasons one is the buildup of fat soluble vitamins that we talked about before the other reason is that when people tend to take very high levels of vitamins and minerals from supplements they tend to spend less time and focus on making sure that they're optimizing their nutrition or at least trying to get their nutrition right what do I mean by getting their nutrition right well I think regardless of whether or not your keto omnivore carnivore vegan or any other nutritional plan the key thing is to get most that is about 75 to 80 of your Foods or more from non-processed or minimally processed sources I think there is agreement across the board that most people should avoid highly processed foods highly processed foods are going to be foods with very long ingredient lists that have very long shelf lives so this often includes snack foods it does include snack foods like chips Etc pastries that could sit on the Shelf a long time but it also includes things like canned soups and number of different other foods that have many many ingredients preservatives most people would do well to avoid those kinds of foods and focus most of their intake on things that are non-processed so these would be things like fruits and vegetables you'll notice that the non-processed foods will tend to have very short shelf life or require refrigeration in some cases such as meat eggs Etc or minimally processed foods such as you know rice and oatmeals and pastas beans and things of that sort beans oftentimes can be completely unprocessed as well of course these are two general categories unprocessed and minimally process that should make up about 80 or more of your food intake if your goal is health and obtaining adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals the so-called foundational supplements include of course vitamin and mineral supplements but has expanded over the last decade or more to also include supplements that have vitamins and minerals but also things like digestive enzymes and again here we have an example where indeed you can get digestive enzymes from foods for instance eating a bit of papaya or even a little bit of Pineapple can assist in the digestion of certain aspects of macronutrients because these are naturally occurring enzymes that help digest things like carbohydrates fats and proteins and there are other food-based sources of enzymes you're welcome to look those up online if you just put food based sources of enzymes and you'll find those but nowadays A lot of the foundational supplements will include papain or they will include different lipases or anytime you hear the word Ace by the way it means an enzyme an enzyme is designed to break down or to catalyze some sort of reaction in biology and nutrition in particular so you can find foundational supplements that include vitamins and minerals and digestive enzymes and nowadays more and more the quality foundational supplements are also including things like adaptogens and here the name adaptogens is sort of vague and it indeed has no specific operational definition this is something really important to understand about supplementation is that companies and indeed podcasts can talk about adaptogens without actually defining what an adaptogen is in an operational way when we say operational what we mean is a definition that everyone in a given Arena or space research for instance can agree on so that when we talk about the adaptogenic effects of a given compound we're all talking about the same things well foundational supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes and the so-called adaptogens and the adaptogens broadly speaking are thought to improve the body and brain's ability ability to buffer against various stressors so these could be things like herbs like ashwagandha that are designed to reduce cortisol levels in that sense ashwagandha is an adaptogen but ashwagandha has other effects related to hormone augmentation in both the testosterone and estrogen and maybe even the thyroid Pathways we'll talk about this a little bit later when we talk about supplements for hormone augmentation so foundational supplements has really expanded to include a lot of different categories of nutrients and micronutrients vitamins and minerals digestive enzymes designed to achieve a broad spectrum of effects again this is the one category of supplementation where I think it makes sense to explore multi-ingredient formulations and the other thing that's often included in these so-called foundational supplements are probiotics or prebiotics which are designed to augment and support the so-called gut microbiome the gut microbiome is the collection of trillions of little micro bacteria that exist in all of us they mainly exist in the mucous membrane-lined tissues of the body so that would be your nasal passages your mouth the vagina the urethra and the gut the whole way from your mouth all the way out the other end so not just your stomach trillions of bacteria live there trillions of microbacteria also live on your skin in fact every time you shake someone's hand you're exchanging microbacteria these micro bacteria often are healthy for us good for us they support a huge number of positive biological functions but there are other microbacteria that live in our gut and Elsewhere on those mucous line tissues that can be disadvantageous for us that can harm our health a growing idea these days based on a number of different Laboratories work including the laboratory of my upstairs neighbor at Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg who's been a guest on this podcast is that having a great diversity a range of microbiota as they're called microbiome microbiota and these microbacteria are all essentially referring to the same thing the microbiome is the whole collection of these microbacteria but having a lot of different so-called species of these microbacteria is known to be advantageous for immune system function hormone function it supports the so-called gut brain axis that's important for a number of things including mood and motivation actually supports the production of neurotransmitters in the brain and body that can help keep you motivated elevated mood support the general function of neurons well not surprisingly there are ways to support the gut microbiome and there are ways to harm the gut microbiome I'll refer to to the podcast episode we did with Justin Sonnenberg you can find that at hubermanlab.com if you want to learn all the different ways you can support your gut microbiome but for sake of today's discussion I want to emphasize that some of those methods of supporting the gut microbiome are through the direct consumption of particular foods and there are two categories of foods that if you're getting enough of them it's likely that your gut microbiome is diverse and is going to support all those important functions I just listed off and other functions as well the two sources of gut microbiota supporting foods are low sugar fermented foods so these would be things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt again low sugar Greek yogurt um kombucha in particular as a drink things like kefir there are a bunch of other varieties of fermented foods different cultures have different fermented foods so Japanese natto is um another source of of ferment that is very good for the gut microbiome and work from Justin sonnenberg's lab and close by Labs at Stanford School of Medicine have shown that if people ingest four servings a day of these low sugar fermented foods it greatly improves the function of the gut microbiome and in particular enhances the function of the immune system and it reduces the so-called inflammatorium it reduces inflammation in the brain and body in the ways that are helpful and effective for brain and body that is mental health physical health and performance so there are ways to support your gut microbiome strictly from food but it should come as no surprise that most people are not ingesting four servings a day of fermented foods hopefully they're getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber which is one other way to support the gut microbiome although the studies from Justin sonnenberg's lab point to the fact that fiber intake itself was not directly supportive of the gut microbiome in everybody it was in some individuals but not in others and some had no effect and in other individuals it actually made the category or I should say the array of inflammatory markers worse it actually led to more inflammation so that's not to say that fiber is bad in fact in the episode that we did with Dr Lane Norton he discussed the many benefits of getting enough fiber there are a lot of reasons why people should get enough fiber in their diet but at least for supporting the gut microbiome four servings a day of low sugar fermented foods seems to be the best way to support the gut microbiome through the intake of nutrition again most people are not achieving that and therefore these foundational supplements that can be just vitamin and mineral supplements or it could be vitamin and mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes or both of those things plus adaptogens now also tend to include prebiotics and probiotics that are designed to support the proliferation and maintenance of enough gut microbiota in order to support the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis now because of the importance of the gut microbiome and because most people are not getting enough support for the gut microbiome in the form of low sugar fermented foods and Prebiotic fiber from their diet I think perhaps one of the most essential foundational supplements irrespective of whether or not it includes vitamins and minerals adaptogens and digestive enzymes is some way to support the gut microbiome now this gets into a whole dimension of of categories of Prebiotic and probiotic capsules and one needs to be very careful there I do want to say that most of the Prebiotic and probiotic capsules that you can buy first of all are very expensive the best ones are going to be refrigerated or required Refrigeration just as do any good low sugar fermented foods by the way so for instance pickles are a low sugar fermented food that can support the gut microbiome but if you're buying pickles from the section of the grocery store where they the pickles are not refrigerated well then you're not going to get the gut microbiome supporting effects from those pickles it's so funny we're even having this conversation talking about pickles but the reality is they can greatly enhance the microbiota if you are getting the pickles that are and require refrigeration and include the brine which is the the liquid around them the same is true for sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut is not going to support your gut microbiome it will supply some other things perhaps but it's not going to support your gut microbiome it has to be the refrigerated versions for the reason that most people are not getting enough food based support for the gut microbiome and because of the importance of the gut microbiome one of the key categories of foundational supplements are supplements that create support for the microbiome through prebiotics or probiotics again they tend to be the refrigerated varieties are the ones that are actually going to work those also tend to be very expensive and there are some evidence that taking excessive amounts of prebiotics and probiotics that is typical of these capsule forms of prebiotics and probiotics if they're taken ongoing not for short periods of time but if they're taken ongoing can lead to some issues like brain fog there's a nice literature on this that and a growing one at that so my suggestion is that if people are going to take supplements to support the microbiome that those supplements include low enough levels that is small enough amounts of prebiotics and probiotics that you don't start to venture into the realm of brain fog and some of the other issues that could be associated with taking too much Prebiotic and probiotic in the form of supplements I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that you get data back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with those data inside tracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional behavioral maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors hormones lipids and other things that impact your immediate and long-term Health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker.com huberman and get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off the other category foundational supplements are those adaptogens that we mentioned earlier adaptogens again being a very poorly defined category but these are typically micronutrients herbs sometimes they go into the mushroom category again these are non psychedelic mushrooms that provide either some buffering to the stress system by reducing cortisol typically or that are thought to or known to based on research studies to enhance things like blood flow to the brain or to enhance some aspect of cognitive function by way of enhancing neurotransmitter function this category of so-called adaptogens is an important one we'll get back to this a little bit later the reason I mention it now is that it is indeed hard to get the so-called adaptogens in sufficient concentrations from food-based sources I have to assume that most people aren't out there collecting chaga mushroom or the ashwagandha herbs and then combining them with their salads or their foods and so that's why this adaptogen category fits into foundational now this opens up the category of foundational supplements that are broad spectrum that is that include vitamins and minerals that have digestive enzymes that have adaptogens and that also have prebiotics and probiotics at the appropriate dosages this is one reason why I'm a big fan of supplements like athletic greens which is as many of you know a sponsor of this podcast and does really nicely cover all of these categories of foundational nutrition but I do want to emphasize that this is not a way to focus on athletic greens specifically there are other categories and brands of excellent foundational nutritional supplements that cover these categories of vitamins and minerals probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes and adaptogens it just so happens that that athletic greens is the one that I discovered and that works best for me and that many people find works really well for them so this is why when people approach me and they ask me as they often do very very often do I should say if I'm only going to take one supplement what supplement should I take rather than just give them one specific answer I actually asked them three questions first question I ask them is how well are you sleeping at night are you getting enough sleep are you waking up feeling rested because if they're not that opens up a whole different set of interactions that we need to have and discussions around what sorts of things they need to do and possibly take in order to get their sleep right because sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance we will have that discussion a little bit later in this episode the second question I asked them is how's your nutrition that is are you eating regularly have you found the combination of macronutrients or which diet is right for you do you think you're getting enough vitamins and minerals how's your digestion we have that conversation and then the third thing that I ask which is extremely important is what's your budget because if somebody has ten dollars a month total to spend on supplements versus a thousand dollars a month to spend on supplements total well then there's a different set of conversations to be had as to which supplements they should take now once those three questions have been answered assuming that somebody is able to spend about a hundred dollars or more on supplements per month then my recommendation is that they not focus on any specific supplements directed towards sleep or toward Focus or hormone augmentation but rather that they focus on buffering and enhancing their foundational nutrition adaptogens probiotics prebiotics and digestive enzymes because of the simple fact that if they do that they're going to raise the tide on all the biological and organ systems that are going to lead to enhanced mental health physical health and performance including sleep so this is one reason why if people say well if I can only take one supplement what should I take I say well what's your budget if they say they can meet that hundred dollar threshold per month then my recommendation would be athletic greens or something like it or that they invest the time and energy to go find the various combinations of vitamins and minerals and probiotics and prebiotics and adaptogens and so forth in individual components that they can then take in combination in order to meet their foundational needs but most people are not interested in doing all that homework and legwork to figure out exactly what those dosages are that's one reason why indeed I have taken athletic green since 2012. I like it it makes me feel better I have more energy I sleep better my digestion is certainly better and it supports the gut microbiome I do that for that reason but again I want to emphasize that there are other great sources of all the relevant things within those foundational formulas that athletic greens contains so it's certainly not the only route to covering your foundational Health needs there are other ways to do that now if somebody has a budget lower than a hundred dollars per month to spend on foundational supplementation well then there are a couple of discussions to be had now if the amount of money that they have to devote to foundational supplementation is zero of course respect that and then it becomes a discussion about what sorts of foods and patterns of food intake are going to best support their mental health physical health performance now if somebody has somewhere between zero dollars and fifty dollars to spend on supplementation for sake of this thing we're calling foundational Health per month well then a different category of supplement discussion arises and we'll have that in a moment but to sort of close the conversation on foundational supplementation again that means many different things it's vitamins and minerals sometimes that's one vitamin and mineral supplement it means digestive enzymes that could be its own supplement or in combination with vitamins and minerals it means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based and mushroom-based formulations that can buffer stress and provide other brain and body support and it often although not always but should I believe include the probiotics and prebiotics or anything that supports healthy gut microbiome once again I think a broad spectrum supplement that has many many ingredients of high quality that covers all these bases is going to be the best route to ensuring foundational supplementation is covered and I do think that should be the starting place for any and all supplementation regimens I'll say that once again I think covering your foundational needs in the realm of vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes and adaptogens is going to give you the most benefit by cost and the most benefit across the board in terms of brain and body systems that's going to allow you to feel better overall sleep better overall focus better overall and support all the different systems in your brain and body that are going to allow you to be at your best while of course also paying careful attention to your nutrition because you simply cannot abandon nutrition again Better Living Through Chemistry still requires Better Living so now that we've had that discussion about foundational supplementation and again highlighting the fact that that's the one category of supplementation where multi-ingredient formulations make the most sense I'd like to now shift our attention to single ingredient formulation supplements that are designed to achieve specific endpoints and here again rather than focus on specific ingredients and supplements to achieve specific endpoints because we've done that already in episodes related to sleep and focus Etc I'd like to take a step back and focus on the larger theme of today's episode which is how to think about supplementation in a rational cost effective and biologically effective way for each of these categories and the three categories that I'm going to cover are sleep hormone support and cognitive enhancement and focus cognitive enhancement and focus being the final third category let's talk about sleep and the rational approach to thinking about supplementation for sleep as I mentioned earlier in this episode and on many previous episodes of this podcast sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance you might be somebody who can do an all-nighter and feel okay the next day or maybe even great but most everybody once they start to have minimal sleep for one or two nights in the form of broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep or sleeping at the wrong time of night there is such a thing or day they start to suffer their mood starts to suffer their cognitive Clarity and performance starts to suffer their mental health can suffer severely and physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything suffers conversely when people are sleeping well that is deeply and enough eighty percent of the nights of their life mental health physical health and performance all flourish and I think most people start to be almost amazed at how well they're doing in various domains of life that previously they might have struggled with so sleep is fundamental that's that's established when thinking about supplementation for sleep we need to ask ourselves a number of important questions first of all you should ask yourself how well that is how deeply and how much are you sleeping per night assuming you're somebody who can fall asleep easily stay asleep through the night wake up feeling relatively rested maybe a little groggy and then can move about your day with plenty of energy and focus you're not falling asleep in class or at work or behind the wheel whereas a passenger on public transportation well then you're probably getting enough sleep and by the way it's perfectly normal to require anywhere from a 10 minute to a 90 minute nap in the afternoon for some people if you're not a napper no big deal it's known that naps can disrupt nighttime sleep but provided that they're early enough in the day if you take a nap and you are still able to fall asleep at night then naps are fine for you if you're somebody who doesn't like naps because you wake up groggy or grumpy which often happens to certain people then don't nap you certainly do not need to nap but if you're feeling energetic throughout the day chances are you're getting enough sleep at night but there are people of course who are struggling with sleep either falling asleep staying asleep or they're not feeling alert enough during the day or all of the above and then it makes sense to step back and take a look at what supplementation can provide if you are one of those people who is not sleeping enough or well enough at night that you are suffering during the day in whatever way mild to severe there are two questions you should ask yourself first of all are you ingesting caffeine after 2 pm if the answer is yes you want to limit or eliminate caffeine after 2 pm maybe even push it back to noon or earlier I know that can be excruciating for some folks but it can really help with your ability to fall and stay asleep at night second thing is most people would do well to avoid food within the two hours prior to bedtime but of course you don't want to be so hungry that you can't fall asleep all right so those are the nutrition and behavioral tools that everyone needs to consider if you are not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m or onwards and you are not eating excessively immediately prior to bedtime or within the two hours prior to bedtime and you're not hungry when you go to sleep well then there are certain supplements that can support your sleep and we've talked about these in the perfect sleep episode and in the episode with our guest expert Matt Walker from University of California Berkeley and in the master your sleep episode and we have a tool kit for sleep that you can access zero cost by going to hearinglab.com and going to the menu go to the newsletter and you can find that toolkit you can sign up for other free toolkits like it but the point here is not to go systematically through each of the supplements that is beneficial or has been shown to be beneficial for sleep but rather to address specific aspects of sleep that can suffer and why and how certain patterns of supplementation can support or alleviate those pain points if for instance you're somebody who falls asleep just fine but wakes up in the middle of the night around 2 or 3 A.M or any time for that matter and has trouble falling back asleep there are two categories of supplements that you might want to consider the first is myoinositol typically taken as 900 milligrams of myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten the amount of time that it takes to fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night myoinositol has other beneficial uses as well for mood Etc if you'd like to see many of the different effects that have been explored in the scientific literature from myoinositol you can go to examine.com it's an excellent site not just for inositol but for all supplements for that matter talks about the human effect Matrix that is the different effects of different supplement compounds on different aspects of hormone brain and body Health where the evidence is strong where the evidence is weak has links to studies and so on again it's examine.com amazing website wonderful website it's provided such a rich resource for me and for you know many many other people other people who wake up in the middle of the night will wake up because their dreams are very intense or they were having dreams that were so vivid that suddenly they were jolted from their dreams those people would do well to avoid certain supplements so in a moment I'll talk about the value of a supplement called theanine for falling asleep but theanine which typically is taken in dosages anywhere from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams depending on body weight and experience and what you find to be most effective for you minimally effective for you well the Indian can be great for many people but for people who have excessively vivid dreams those excessively vivid dreams can lead to immediate waking and sometimes a little bit of anxiety upon waking in the middle of the night so some people who wake up in the middle of the night so jolted mentally and physically out of sleep because of their intense dreams would do well to avoid theanine supplementation I've talked about this a bit before but it's something that I think a lot of nighttime middle of the night wakers might be familiar with and would want to take into consideration now for those of you that are not waking up in the middle of the night or not having excessively vivid dreams but are having trouble falling asleep two supplements in particular have been shown to be effective for shortening the transition time to sleep and allowing people to ease into sleep more readily and those are magnesium 3 and 8 which is interchangeable with magnesium bis glycinate magnesium bisclycinate and magnesium threonate both have transporter systems that allow them to readily cross the blood-brain barrier and they lead to a mild form of drowsiness mild in the sense that it's not going to prevent you from operating a motor vehicle or kind of any conditions under emergency that might arise in the middle of the night or if they did a rise during the middle of night you'd still be able to function so it's not like a sleeping pill but people who take those often find that their transition time into sleep is much faster and their sleep is also much deeper incidentally those supplements are also thought to be useful for cognitive support and neuroprotection although there's less data on that okay so that's for falling asleep that's one category either magnesium magnesium three and eight or bis glycine would be interchangeable for assisting the transition time into sleep and then the other supplement is apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin which is a derivative of chamomile I've talked about this in various podcasts before also acts as a bit of a anxiety lowering compound which is essential prior to sleep for people to essentially turn off their thinking or to be able to reduce the amount of ruminating and problem solving and future anticipation that they're doing which is a requirement for falling asleep so what's the rational approach to supplementing in a way that allows you to fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep well would you immediately take magnesium three Nate and apogenin together well that depends if you have the budget and you just simply want to fall asleep quicker and you don't care which of those two ingredients is going to be more effective for you well then you could try one for instance magnesium three and eight and try it for perhaps a week and see how that affects your latency to sleep time that is how quickly you fall asleep or you can try apogenic in the first week or you could combine them both or you could try magnesium three night for a week then switch to only apogenin for a week and evaluate which one works better for you if neither works for you I do recommend trying the combination together again this is just the way that any scientist would design an experiment to try and understand which variables that is which ingredients are most effective for the result that you want as opposed to just lumping them together and taking them that said a lot of people want excellent sleep so badly that they just say okay I'm just going to take magnesium 3 and 8 I'm going to take apogen and I'm going to take theanine if my dreams are too Vivid and I'm waking up in the middle of the night from excessively vivid dreams I'll drop the theanine and many people actually derive great benefit from that approach but because today we're talking about the most rational cost effective and biologically effective approach to supplementation if you're not sleeping as well as you would like to or if you want to explore what sleeping even more deeply might do for your mental health physical health and performance well then it makes sense to think about the various supplements for falling asleep versus remaining asleep what to include what not to include and to do that systematically and again I think one week's time of taking something provided it doesn't induce any negative effects right if something induces a negative effect I recommend ceasing taking it immediately but if something does not produce any negative effects then I think you want to try a single ingredient formulation for about a week while not varying anything else not changing anything else in your overall Protocols of nutrition or supplementation I mean it's impossible to clamp everything perfectly from week to week but you know don't change anything else dramatically and just add that supplement for a given week see how it benefits your sleep maybe add in a second second supplement if you like or rather Swap and try a different supplement for a week and then see what works best and see if the combination works even better now I acknowledge that what I just described is exceedingly basic but it's something that I don't think most people do most people either decide they have the budget and the interest in just improving their sleep across the board and they don't care what ingredient is providing the maximum benefit or they simply try something and decide oh well it didn't work for me and so I'm not going to try anything else supplements don't work for me or magnesium doesn't work for me or um you know I woke up in the middle of the night from vivid dreams and that's because they're taking more of a shotgun approach without teasing out the different variables in fact if there's an overriding theme of today's conversation it's really about learning how to isolate variables in the realm of supplementation because once you do that and once you start to develop that Intuition or sensitivity of sorts to how different ingredients impact you it is an enormously powerful stance to have because you're going to keep your costs limited you're also going to find the things that work particularly poorly for you and more importantly the things that work particularly well for you toward your goals any discussion about supplementation for sleep I feel has to include a discussion about melatonin I've talked about melatonin before on numerous podcasts mine and others and I will say once again I am not a fan of melatonin for a couple of reasons melatonin is a hormone known to induce sleepiness but not keep us asleep so oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep and then wake up and have trouble falling back asleep the other reason is that melatonin supplements almost always include levels of melatonin or amounts of melatonin that far far exceed the normal biological levels or so-called endogenous levels of melatonin that we would normally produce and yes it's true that as we age we produce less melatonin but melatonin as a hormone also impacts other hormone systems in particular the reproductive hormone access testosterone estrogen Etc which is not to say that if you've been taking melatonin for some period of time that you've disrupted your fertility or those hormone axes but it's possible that you've disrupted them somewhat and it's very clear that melatonin can impact not just sleep but other systems in the brain and body it can be useful for jet lag and for occasional use but they're also I want to voice a message of caution there have been studies exploring the dosages of melatonin contained in various supplements and whether or not what's listed on the bottle matches what's actually contained in those formulations and despite those formulations coming from quite reliable quote unquote or thought to be reliable sources it was found that these supplements contain anywhere from 15 percent of what's thought to be or is told to be in those supplements or many times more melatonin than is listed on the bottle so the dosaging does not seem to be consistent with what's often listed on the bottle and this is even true within some of the more reputable Brands so that's a real concern so we need to highlight melatonin as perhaps something that's only used occasionally if you want to talk about dosages for melatonin use for jet lag Etc go to examine.com there's some excellent references to studies there just put melatonin into the search function it'll tell you everything you need to know about melatonin but now you know my stance on melatonin one question I often get about supplementation for sleep is does it create a dependency that's an excellent question to ask I think most people worry about even fear relying on something so heavily that if they did not have it for whatever reason that they couldn't sleep in my experience there is no problem falling and staying asleep in the absence of a supplement for sleep even if you've been taking that supplement for sleep consistently seven days a week for months and months maybe even years on end I confess that I occasionally fall asleep having not taken my pre-sleep supplements and I happen to take magnesium three and eight theanine and epigenin I also take inositol it greatly enhances my sleep and there have been nights when I've fallen asleep not having taken any of those things and I've slept fine that said if I were to explore multiple nights of trying to sleep without that supplementation I find that my sleep is not as good I'm still able to fall asleep but the depth of my sleep and the duration of my sleep is not as good as when I'm supplementing so I think that's refreshing news at least to me that there isn't a dependence on these supplements in order to be able to fall asleep it's not the same sort of dependence that people experience from things like sleeping pills that said any compound any compound can create a placebo type effect where we think we need something in order to achieve a certain effect we had a guest on this podcast some time ago Dr Ali Crum who's a professor at Stanford and works on these mindset effects belief effects and Placebo effects and Placebo effects can be very real and in some sense dovetail with any conversation about dependency meaning if you are somebody who loves your sleep supplements and sleeps great with them and one night you discover you don't have them or you can't access them for whatever reason that can create a little bit of an anxiety around the idea that oh in the in their absence you're not going to be able to sleep and that's a sort of a placebo effect in Reverse if you will because what it suggests is that there's a emotional or a cognitive association with taking these things that allows you to sleep well I would highly recommend that people explore this issue of dependency and Placebo effects for Sleep supplements on their own and under conditions in which there's nothing pressing the next day that is you don't have a big presentation Etc so what I recommend is that every two weeks or so maybe every month or so take one night off completely from all your sleep supplements or leave out one sleep supplement try to understand to what extent you might have established a dependency either real or Placebo based on these sleep supplements and again I suggest doing this on perhaps a Friday night so that you know it's a weekend the next day so you don't have to work if perhaps you don't sleep well I think what you'll find is what most people find and that's in the absence of taking your supplement stack for Sleep one night you're still gonna sleep just fine now does that mean that these supplements are not actually working under normal conditions where you're taking them each night no what this means is that many of these things magnesiums in particular can build up in the body and brain in a way that can be beneficial and what probably explains the fact that you can still sleep if you miss a night of taking them is that the neural circuits that are involved in turning off thinking or in not thinking and falling asleep those neural circuits undergo what's called plasticity in other words if you get better at falling and staying asleep over time even if you got better at that through the Assistance or with the assistance of some supplement or combination of supplements well then those circuits are still going to function just fine even in the absence of not taking those supplements just once we'll get back into this conversation a little bit later when we talk about cognitive enhancement and focus it's the same story there where indeed there are things that people can take in stimulant form and non-stimulant form that can enhance cognitive ability and focus but that does not mean that you become so dependent on those that you can't focus unless you take them this has been shown multiple times over so again to answer the question is there a dependency established by taking supplements for sleep the short answer is no with the caveat that Placebo effects and belief effects are always going to be at play whether or not you're talking about supplementation prescription drugs or even behavioral protocols for that matter I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens I started taking athletic Greens Way back in 2012 so that's 10 years now of taking athletic greens every single day so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs so whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins minerals probiotics adaptogens to combat stress and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion I just feel much better when I'm drinking athletic greens if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and for the month of January they have a special offer where they'll give you 10 free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2 vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function metabolic function Hormone Health but also calcium regulation and heart health again that's athletic greens.com huberman to claim their special offer in the month of January of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 the next category of supplementation that I'd like to talk about is hormone support improving or so-called optimizing your hormones is a critical aspect of mental health physical health and performance we've done multiple episodes about hormones including testosterone and estrogen for both men and women and for people of different ages we've also had episodes on thyroid hormone growth hormone and so on you can find all those at hubermanlab.com in fact you can go to the hubermanlab.com website there's a search function where you can just put in a keyword and it will take you to all the episodes and specific time points where that topic happens to be covered now Hormone Health is such an important topic to discuss in the context of supplementation because indeed there are compounds that are non-prescription based so-called supplements that can improve hormone function again anytime we are discussing a particular aspect of mental health physical health or performance we need to start with a mention of the few behavioral tools and nutrition-based tools or at least some top Contour coverage of those in a way that frames up the discussion about supplementation appropriately so in the context of hormone support and augmentation and optimization if you are not getting adequate calories from high quality sources hormones like testosterone and estrogen will suffer this is one of the reasons why women will stop having their periods if they're not ingesting enough calories this is one of the reasons why testosterone levels will drop if people are not ingesting enough calories in fact on the episode with expert guest and medical doctor Peter attia he described how sex hormone binding globulin this is a protein that's present in males and females that binds to testosterone and other hormones and prevents it from being in its free form which is the more active form well insulin which of course is going to increase after the ingestion of carbohydrates in particular insulin actually inhibits or reduces sex hormone binding globulin what this means is that for you intermittent fasters or people that are ingesting very few carbohydrates or have very low blood glucose or perhaps are taking things like metformin or berberine which is a supplement based approach to reducing blood glucose well your sex hormone binding globulin is going to increase dramatically conversely if you are eating enough calories in the form of foods that allow your insulin to be a bit higher not excessively High we hope but a bit higher well then sex hormone bonding globulin will go down and free testosterone will go up so the discussion about hormone support and augmentation has to include some nod toward or understanding of the fact that nutrition and the way that nutrition impacts hormones and the way that hormones such as insulin impact other hormones such as free testosterone that all has to be acknowledged that is not the topic of today's discussion but it's important that I remind everybody that nutrition matters for General hormone status it's also important to remember that behaviors matter for hormone status getting morning sunlight increases cortisol levels cortisol levels are very important to have elevated early in the day for focus and alertness and for immune function and to make sure that cortisol levels are low at night and thereby levels of growth hormone and testosterone which is secreted mainly in the early morning can be elevated at night and in the early morning so getting morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise in the form of both cardiovascular exercise but also relatively short meaning an hour or less bouts of intense resistance training a few times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles in fact in the episode that we did with Dr Duncan French again you find that episode at hubermanlab.com he described a very strenuous but still brief two day a week protocol of using resistance training specifically to increase testosterone and free testosterone and growth hormone and so on so nutrition matters exercise matters when it comes to increasing supporting or augmenting different hormones and that's just the discussion about testosterone free testosterone and estrogen there's also the vast discussion about thyroid hormone Etc again we've covered all those topics in previous episodes but once those behavioral tools are in place once you're doing the right things and you're avoiding the wrong things doing the right things to support your hormones and avoiding the things that diminish hormones in the ways that can be detrimental once your nutrition is in place to support your hormones then it makes sense to turn and consider what supplements can support hormones but I do believe that you want to get your behaviors and your nutrition correct before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones again I'll repeat that get your nutrition and your behaviors correct for sake of hormones and for other health purposes before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones and certainly before you start thinking about prescription-based approaches to improving hormones once all of those other elements are in place the supplements that make sense in terms of augmenting hormones come in two forms one are broadband support for multiple hormones and then the others are supplements that are designed to increase or in some cases decrease specific hormones or hormone Pathways so let's consider each of those in tandem there are certain supplements things like Sheila G for instance something from ayurvedic medicine which may mainly uh has the active ingredient fulvic acid which is known to for instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone which in women is going to increase certain aspects of egg growth hence the name follicle stimulating hormone it's going to stimulate certain aspects of fertility it's Pro fertile and in males can make for more sperm production or more motile sperm FSH is also going to indirectly increase testosterone in males it's known to increase libido in both males and females so things like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones and support multiple hormone systems generally in the direction of pro-fertility pro libido and increasing estrogen and testosterone now there are other supplements such as ashwagandha that also fall into this category of affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha is a very potent supplement in terms of reducing cortisol levels it has also been shown to increase testosterone levels but probably indirectly and that's because cortisol and testosterone sort of exist on a seesaw in terms of Pathways they're on separate Pathways but those Pathways interact enough that when cortisol is lowered in general testosterone tends to increase now it is important that with certain hormones like ashwagandha that you don't take them for more than two weeks at a time at high dosages if you want to know more of the specifics around ashwagandha and how long to take it how to cycle it Etc please see our episode on Master stress please also see the examine.com website and put in ashwagandha it will get into some of that description but Sheila G ashwagandha and things for instance like L-Carnitine a supplement that we often discuss in terms of fertility because it can indeed improve sperm motility and quality and egg quality so it's a pro fertile compound but it also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways so it's having a more indirect effect on hormones there are many other compounds present and available supplements that are purported to be pro-hormone support in particular for testosterone or estrogen fertility and libido there is a description for instance of things like maca root maca root can increase libido it's found to be particularly effective in women but in men as well and in all people who are suffering from lower libido due to intake of ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for whatever reason ssris are used to treat OCD they're used to treat depression any number of different things maca root can be in many instances effective in increasing libido it does that however through augmentation of dopamine related Pathways and some of the hormone Pathways Upstream of testosterone and estrogen the reports that Maca increases testosterone are somewhat scant and a little bit weak to be honest so it's having these indirect effects that may impact testosterone Downstream so again I'd put Maca alongside ashwagandha alongside shilaji as supplements that are impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward increased libido increased fertility increased testosterone or estrogen likely through indirect pathways now with all that said I'd like to provide some examples of supplements that work more directly on specific hormone Pathways aimed at achieving more specific goals such as elevated testosterone or elevated free testosterone or elevated growth hormone for that matter and elevated thyroid hormone I'd like to talk about growth hormone first because it's actually a pretty short discussion first of all the best way to augment growth hormone is to get quality deep sleep especially the sleep that occurs in the first three or four hours of the night is when growth hormone is released and it's going to be beneficial to avoid caloric intake in the two hours preceding sleep again don't go to bed so hungry that you wake up an hour or an hour and a half later or you have trouble falling asleep but avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep and certainly avoiding alcohol and cannabis is going to facilitate growth hormone release in the first hours of sleep many people use intermittent fasting or even longer periods of fasting to increase growth hormone one of the interesting things I learned from an expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette who's a medical doctor on this podcast is that indeed while lengthy or fast or intermittent fasting can increase growth hormone levels very substantially it has indirect effects on the genetic Pathways and The receptors for growth hormone that actually are detrimental for the function of growth hormone so avoiding food for the two hours prior to bedtime is a good idea if you avoid food for longer that's just going to assist even more certainly isn't going to hurt in terms of growth hormone release but extended fast specifically for the purpose of increasing growth hormone are not really logical when you look at the broader effects of extended fast that is not to say that extended fasting is not appropriate for some people it can be in certain instances or that intermittent fasted so-called time restricted feeding is not beneficial for some people it can be here I'm only referring to the effects or in this case the lack of effects of intermittent fasting time restricted feeding on growth hormones specifically now in terms of supplements to increase growth hormone there are very few supplements that have been shown to augment this pathway there is some idea that Arginine supplementation prior to bedtime can further Elevate levels of growth hormone especially when fasted that literature is rather weak to be honest I encourage you to go to examine.com if you want to peruse those particular studies really the things that increase growth hormone very potently fall outside the realm of supplementation they include exercise again look at the Duncan French episode or in the Kyle Gillette episode on optimizing hormones in males in particular but this also pertains to females that avoiding food two hours prior to bedtime really can boost growth hormone significantly in sleep beyond what it would be otherwise but it's really only once you get into the realm of prescription compounds things like peptides like sermorelin which increase igf-1 and growth hormone things like growth hormone Itself by prescription if and only if it's prescribed by a doctor of course and is safe for you that's when you start getting into really significant increases in growth hormone not a lot of supplements out there to increase growth hormone potently now it's a different story when you start thinking about and talking about testosterone and free testosterone and luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone is released from the pituitary which is this gland not far from the roof of your mouth and its nearby neighbor the hypothalamus is a collection of neurons that sits above the roof of your mouth and talks to the pituitary talks to it through neural connections and hormone-based connections there is a hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone that is released from the hypothalamus into the pituitary it stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone or LH which then travels in the bloodstream to impact multiple tissues in the body but mainly the ovary in females and the testes and males to stimulate estrogen production and testosterone production there are supplements that can potently increase GnRH and or luteinizing a hormone and then indirectly increase testosterone and estrogen and I always like to remind people testosterone and estrogen are present in both males and females okay and both are important for things like libido muscle growth and so on a lot of people think that oh in males you know having very high testosterone and low estrogen is actually ideal it's actually not ideal if you want to keep your libido anything that lowers your estrogen too far is going to reduce your libido you don't want estrogen too high but you also do not want it too low so supplements that can tickle this pathway or actually can act as a bit more of a directed hammer on this luteinizing hormone pathway may also impact GnRH are things like fedojia agrestis this is an herb that I've talked about before on the podcast that when taken at dosages of 600 milligrams per day many people not all report elevated levels of libido elevated sperm production elevated testosterone in some cases elevated estrogen a bunch of hormones Downstream of luteinizing hormone now are you going to be a fedojia agrestis responder or a non-responder there's simply no way to know except by trying it if you are going to go down this route there are two very important considerations first of all there's a fairly extensive literature on the fact that fidoji agrestis can be toxic to testicular cells and perhaps other cells when taken at very high dosages so obeying the particular dosages of fedogio aggressus that are recommended on various product labels and cycling for doji Augustus can be important some people need to cycle it eight weeks on two weeks off other people opt for 12 weeks on a month off I know a few people who have taken it continuously with no issues but I do want to suggest caution when taking fidochio agrestis the cautionary notes are stay within the recommended dosage ranges you can go lower but certainly don't go higher and I think it is wise to cycle every eight weeks or so to come off it for two weeks and then going back on if that's your choice if you feel it benefited you or taking it for 12 week periods of time and then cycling off for a full month before repeating again the best way to know whether or not fedojia or any of these other supplements is impacting your hormone levels in the direction that you want and not impacting your hormone levels or other aspects of your biology in ways that you don't want is from a blood test there is simply no better tool to evaluate whether or not these supplements are working to support your hormones in the ways that you want and not causing issues except to take a blood test this podcast has inside tracker as a sponsor that can do in-home blood tests and give you blood panels there are other sources of blood tests that are quite good as well of course and in the first episode of The huberman Lab podcast that I did with Dr Kyle Gillette again a medical doctor expert in hormones diabetes and various other aspects of medicine he described and it is time stamped how to stand the best probability of getting your insurance to cover a blood test how to talk to your doctor about getting a hormone panel and so on so I'll refer you to that episode for that but blood tests are going to be very important I recommend taking them before adding in any supplement to increase hormones of any kind or decreased hormones of any kind for that matter and then again after about four to eight weeks of taking that particular supplement in order to evaluate whether or not it worked and whether or not it had any negative effects that you would like to avoid I also wanted to remind people of the dosage conversation that we had earlier just because there's a recommended dosage of fedogio agrestis of say 600 milligrams per day first of all that is not an invitation to take twice as much and expect twice the positive effects that is not a good approach especially with something like fedogiograstis which can at high dosages be toxic but it's also important to perhaps consider taking a lower dosage and seeing how that affects your hormones that approach requires a bit more patience I know most people are thinking I want the effect and I want it now but I think it's very important when thinking about exercise your nutrition or supplementation to really play the long game to think about what's going to work for you in the immediate end in the long term and to ease into any kind of supplement regimen for instance by taking one thing at a time varying One supplement out and One supplement in starting at minimal effective dose and build up your protocols over a year or several years it really can be beneficial I can say for myself I started exploring the supplement space and taking different supplements in different combination and alone evaluating which ones worked and did not work for me some were absolutely dreadful for me I have tons of stories about supplement fail some of which were just kind of innocuous meaning they were a waste of money which isn't innocuous but at least it wasn't detrimental to my health other supplements which fortunately don't exist on the market anymore um I think actually uh were quite dangerous and I feel lucky that I did not experience even greater negative effects from them other supplements have been tremendously useful for me and for other people for things like sleep and hormone support focus and so on so for Doja gracias is a good example of a supplement that is known to have potent effects but you need to approach it with the appropriate um I would say respect for the fact that the dosage ranges in which it works um have to be kept pretty narrow without causing issues it does increase luteinizing hormone and thereby testosterone and estrogen so if you're somebody who's already excessively high in one or the other it's going to be very hard to just direct it to only testosterone or only estrogen now the topic of today's episode is not about fedoji Augustus per se I highlight it because it is one of the more potent supplements for sake of hormone augmentation but it's still fairly Broadband it's a little more specific than something like shilaji but it's still fairly Broadband in terms of hitting multiple endpoint hormones testosterone and estrogen and maybe some other hormones as well there are other supplements in particular Tonga Ali which is known to for instance increase libido whether or not it does that by way of augmenting dopamine related Pathways or testosterone Pathways still isn't clear it is known to increase free testosterone by reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can be beneficial both for men and for women in dosages anywhere from 200 milligrams to 600 milligrams per day so there I would say scale according to body size although start with the minimum amount and find the minimal effective dose for you again blood work is going to be the most effective way to determine what's working or not working at the level of objective numbers but subjective experience matters too you know if you take it at 400 milligrams for four weeks and you don't notice any effect you might try it at 600 milligrams but not higher and if you still don't see an effect well then it doesn't appear to have worked for you other people experience dramatic effects from things like fedoja and Tonga Ali why would that be the case well if you look to the scientific literature what you find is that the studies that report the biggest effects of any supplement usually start with a population that somehow diminished or back on its heels in one particular Dimension so for instance people that are hypogonadal that are not making enough testosterone or free testosterone in fact their levels are very very low they're subclinical off range in terms of the charts below the normal well those people when they take supplements like Tonga Ali fedoja tend to experience greater effects because they're starting from a lower level than people who perhaps are close to the optimal levels achieved through either age genetics exercise nutrition or some combination of those so that's an important thing to think about these are called floor effects and sealing effects ceiling effects are for instance if an individual already has very high testosterone and free testosterone and they take a supplement to increase it further they might not see any increase whereas somebody who sits more in the middle to low range stands to experience a much greater increase in fact one individual I know who took Tonga Ali admittedly on my recommendation his testosterone was initially very low and he was having a number of different symptoms he did blood work he that's how he knew it was low and he then took Tonga Ali and fedoja in combination because he decided he just wanted results he didn't care which What which thing was going to give him the results and he experienced big increases in testosterone this would be not free but total testosterone of he experienced as much as 600 nanograms per deciliter increase from where he was before which is very dramatic it was a near tripling of where his testosterone had started off to where he ended up I don't know if he's ever done the experiment of removing fidojia or Tonga to find out which one it was and this is why many people just take them in combination and if you have the budget for it and you are interested in just finding what works but not isolating what works at the level of single ingredients that would be the approach I recommend however again I think most people do well to figure out which specific ingredients are going to work best for them by isolating the variables the way I've described repeatedly throughout this episode to my knowledge Tonga Ali does not need to be cycled meaning you don't have to take periods of time off from it I should note that the effects of Tonga Ali can take a little bit longer to experience so perhaps blood work should be done 8 to 12 weeks after initiating the Tonga Ali protocol as opposed to earlier and it does seem to have sort of cumulative effects on libido and that points to the likelihood that it's having some impact on neural Pathways as opposed to hormone Pathways hormone Pathways can be slow but in general neural pathways are the ones that are going to explain slow Rising shifts in any kind of physical or mental aspect that then remains stable over time so the exact effects of Tonga Ali and where meaning where they arise in the brain and body aren't known I will provide a link to a really beautiful review article that covers the literature on tonganali this came out fairly recently and that I've reviewed with a number of other um MDS and medical or medicine related podcasters it's a really nice review I'll provide a link to that gives a survey of Tonga Ali what people are discovering what they're finding what they're not finding and so forth as a final note on supplements for hormone augmentation and supplementation I want to make a brief mention of something specifically related to female Health which is of course the menstrual cycle and across the menstrual cycle different hormones are present at different levels follicle stimulating hormone is very high during the so-called follicular phase right and then you have your luteal phase we have an entire episode coming up about female hormones and Hormone Health that will cover this we also covered a little bit of this in the other episodes on testosterone and estrogen but the point I'd like to make now is that for women they should fully expect that certain supplements not all but certain supplements because of the way they impact different hormones would have different effects maybe even opposite effects at different phases of the menstrual cycle and for that reason I believe it is especially important to have tight control over dosage and individual ingredients in your supplement regimen so for instance if you're somebody who takes Sheila Gene I know many women who take Sheila G or Tonga Ali for instance or Maca and you find that it really serves you well that is it provides the mental and physical benefits that you want and enjoy at certain phases of your menstrual cycle but at other phases of your menstrual cycle it feels like too much or it actually can start to give you negative mental or physical effects well then obviously having control over those specific ingredients is going to be extremely important so that you can titrate the dosage or increase the dosage as the case may be or cease taking those things entirely at certain phases of your menstrual cycle that's not to say that some women can't just continuously take these supplements throughout their menstrual cycle some can but some find that that makes them very uncomfortable or that they would do well to alter different ingredients at different phases of their cycle so again this speaks to the critical importance of single ingredient control dosage control and the ability to cease taking individual or multiple ingredients according to the backdrop of your health generally and obviously the menstrual cycle is a profound shift in the hormones and thus the entire biological and psychological milieu that exists in the body and of course there's the issue of birth control and whether or not people are taking hormone-based birth control certain forms of hormone-based birth control and women involve tonically elevating that means consistently elevating estrogen that's certainly going to reduce the fluctuations and thus the probability that certain hormones and hormone Pathways will change across the menstrual cycle but not eliminate it altogether also there's the key issue of fertility in both males and females one important note even though this is not an episode about fertility we're going to have one soon but the important point about fertility is that there are supplements not just Sheila G but there are supplements and supplement protocols such as L-Carnitine in particular injectable L-Carnitine which does require a prescription at least in the US but also orally ingested L-Carnitine that can improve sperm health and motility and egg health and motility I mentioned that earlier but if couples are trying to conceive it is important that if you're going to take something that is a supplement directed towards sperm and or egg Health that you also consider how that interfaces with some of the other hormone-based compounds that is prescription drugs that you may be taking this is true for people who are doing IVF in vitro fertilization or not again that entire discussion will be handled in our episode on fertility and on female hormone health and we already did the episode with Dr Kyle Gillette on male hormone Health optimization the next category of supplementation that I'd like to address is supplements related to cognitive enhancement and focus and here there are a number of very useful strategies that one could take I'd like to divide this conversation into two general categories of supplements to address cognitive enhancement and focus the first category are supplements that increase energy by way of stimulant properties so the most obvious of these is caffeine caffeine is of course a molecule that can increase levels of alertness it also can increase levels of focus provided that dosages are in the appropriate range the appropriate range in most cases is going to be one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight taken 30 minutes or so before any kind of mental or physical Endeavor we did an entire episode about caffeine where you can learn lots of facts about caffeine how best to utilize caffeine and indeed I'll just give you a few of those now turns out that if your regular caffeine user you can still derive the cognitive enhancing and focus enhancing effects of caffeine if you ingest caffeine every day but if you were to take two days off from caffeine completely and right now I hear all the caffeine addicts out there just kind of cringing at the idea and then take caffeine in the 30 minutes prior to some especially important event physical or mental event where you really need to focus and be able to sustain that Focus for long periods of time it would have an even greater effect than it normally would but since most people are taking caffeine in a kind of ongoing regular way I just want to emphasize that it still has Pro cognitive and pro-focus effects even if it's taken every day or even multiple times per day again a cautionary note don't drink caffeine too late in the day past 2 p.m it can really start to impede uh your sleep at night even if you can fall asleep at night the architecture of that sleep is not going to be great if you're ingesting caffeine in the preceding eight to ten and even 12 hours and that actually raises another tangential but still important point so I'm going to make it and then get back to supplements which is the best cognitive enhancer that you will ever take is a really good night's sleep of sufficient duration okay so sleep is going to be the Bedrock of your ability to focus and remember things in fact it's during sleep that neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity it's actually not when you trigger learning but it's when you consolidate and reinforce learning and a number of other things that relate to cognitive enhancement and focus the other thing of course is that you're going to need to have sufficient levels of nutrition so you don't want to be overly hungry or it's going to be hard to focus nor do you want to be overloaded with calories or a volume of food or have your blood glucose to be so high that it's going to make you sleepy there's a reason why when discussing stress and the so-called autonomic nervous system that the phrase rest and digest comes into play rest and digest as the name implies relates to the fact that when we have a lot of food in our gut it tends to make us sleepy in other words it's hard for us to focus and it's hard for us to maintain cognitive attention and remember things Etc so there are a bunch of Behavioral tools for enhancing Focus we did an entire episode on enhancing focus it does touch on supplementation again you can find links to that in all formats at hubermanlab.com we also have a newsletter related to this topic also at hubermanlab.com at zero cost with all of that said and in particular the Highlight about sleep being the best way to enhance your cognitive abilities and focus anytime we're having a discussion about supplements for enhancing cognitive ability and focus a major category of those supplements is going to fall into the stimulant category and that's going to include most often caffeine although there are other sources of stimulants I'm not going to touch on those for the moment just talk about caffeine when people hear caffeine they think well I can just drink coffee and indeed that's a great source of caffeine so is yerba mate I would caution people to um if you're going to use yerba mate for whatever purpose caffeine or otherwise that you avoid the smoked versions of yerba mate they are carcinogenic that is the smoked versions or carcinogenic I know and to consume the non-smoked uh varieties um instead the important thing to understand about caffeine is that while it can be ingested in the form of a drink or an energy drink to your coffee it can also be ingested as a pure supplement that is there are caffeine supplements and I know a number of people including a very very prominent podcaster whose name I won't mention who drinks herbal tea but takes a 100 to 300 milligram tablet of caffeine with the herbal tea so in that case it is no longer herbal tea it is caffeinated herbal tea when you take caffeine in pill form it tends to have a much more potent and long lasting effect than when you take caffeine in the form of coffee or tea it's actually a world apart in terms of its effects and if you haven't experienced this before it might be something that you want to explore it might not be something you want to explore in particular if you're somebody who experiences anxiety or panic attacks be very careful with your intake of caffeine again see the episode of the huberman law podcast all about caffeine for more on that but it is the case that even 100 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form I suppose it could be in capsule form as well but in its pure form leads to much greater enhancement of alertness and focus then does often the comparable amount or even twice the amount of caffeine contained in coffee or tea now why would that be has a lot to do with the other things that are in coffee and tea so here I'm not encouraging people to become reliant on caffeine capsules or on caffeine tablets but if you want to increase alertness and focus caffeine is a potent way to do that it works the other category of stimulant that can work in terms of enhancing alertness and focus are going to be things that increase adrenaline in some other way or epinephrine as it's also called adrenaline epinephrine same thing in some other way that are going to touch into or augment the so-called adrenergic and adrenaline systems and there are things like yohimbine and different forms of yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um there are multiple forms of these things now I would go to examine.com to explore the different forms of your himbine about 10 20 years ago yohimbine was marketed primarily as a pro libido and pro-erectile agent turns out it has very low efficacy for both of those things but there are certain forms of yohimbine that act as stimulants that are effective and are separate from those claims and Pathways one particular form is called Alpha yohimbine it sometimes goes by the name raulstein and that's spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e again that's Alpha yohimbine and it's used as a stimulant often to also promote fat loss and alertness I have to say that it's a very potent and somewhat um precarious supplement some people experience a lot of anxiety on it that could also be because they tend to take it on either an empty stomach or in combination with sub caloric diets it's a it's sort of getting out on the edge of things that for some people can work not so well for other people they might actually find it to be a very effective stimulant in general in terms of supplement based approaches to increase cognitive function and focus caffeine either in coffee or tea form or in tablet or capsule form but at lower dosages than you would find in coffee and tea I think is actually a reasonable way to explore stimulant-based approaches for enhancing cognitive function and focus I mentioned all that not because I think that you probably already didn't know that caffeine can enhance alertness and focus most people already know that and I acknowledge that but rather as a contrast point for the other supplement based approach for increasing cognitive function and focus which is to increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways that are not stimulant based so for instance Alpha GPC which is essentially a choline donor acts in the pathways related to the neuromodulator acetylcholine and can enhance Focus so at dosages of anywhere from 300 to 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels of focus for sake of mental work or physical work the half-life of alpha GPC is about four to six hours so it's relatively short lasting although you wouldn't necessarily want to take it right before bed I don't recommend that it is not a stimulant it tends to enhance focus by augmenting acetylcholine and acetylcholine Pathways specifically now it does create a little bit of an increase in alertness so some people actually perceive it subjectively as an increase in overall stimulation but it's different than a caffeine type stimulant so for instance 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC taken alone will allow people to be more focused but doesn't tend to make people feel jittery or over stimulated similarly 500 milligrams to a thousand milligrams or somewhere in between of something like l-tyrosine which is amino acid precursor to dopamine a different neuromodulator taken a loan or in conjunction with again I believe in separating these things out by product but I suppose you could take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together if you had already tried them separately and decide they worked well for you then you decide to combine them what people tend to experience is that the cholinergic stimulation from alpha GPC and the dopaminergic stimulation from l-tyrosine or simply l-tyrosine alone or Alpha GPC alone leads to increased levels of focus without the kind of overall feelings of stimulant-based alertness that one would experience with caffeine and indeed or I should say of course there are products out there and there are people out there that combine all three of these things together caffeine Alpha GPC and l-tyrosine and while I'm not suggesting that's a good or a bad thing I would suggest that anytime you start to explore the cognitive enhancing effects and the focus enhancing effects of any supplement that you ask which ones are stimulants so for instance caffeine and Alpha human being which ones tend to tap more into neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC and l-tyrosine and to separate those out conceptually because whereas things like Alpha yohim binding caffeine will mostly serve the role of increasing levels of alertness but not tightening your focus things like Alpha GPC and l-tyrosine tend to serve the role of less elevation and alertness but more tightening of focus and this of course is why people often stack these and take them in combination so I think it's a very important distinction that most people aren't aware of and I'm not here to tell you that the stimulant-based approach or the neuromodulator based approach is better or worse they are simply different from one another although I will say that I think it is important to explore them separately if indeed you're going to explore any of them before you would start to combine them in a single formula again individual ingredients are going to be the way to go in terms of figuring out what's best for you if anything some people may find that even the slightest bit of caffeine or even the slightest spit of alpha GPC or l-tyrosine just places them into a state of mind and or body that's just uncomfortable and not compatible with the kind of work that they want to do whereas other people searching myself regularly rely on taking 300 milligrams of alpha GPC it turns out more than that kind of doesn't work for me or it tends to send my mind down a pathway that I don't like to be in for sake of cognitive work but I will routinely take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to some cognitive work or prior to a workout I do often combine that with some caffeine not in capsule or pill form but rather in the form of cup of coffee or yerba mate and it turns out that for me just by way of example l-tyrosine is something that works very powerfully to elevate my level of focus but that I tend to crash pretty hard afterward and so I tend to error away from l-tyrosine but some people tolerate it really well and actually really like it I rely on something else for dopamine augmentation which is phenylethylamine which is a little bit more short lasting again I arrived at these protocols for myself by mixing and matching but mostly by trying individual ingredients alone before combining them into any sort of cocktail before taking them you for a workout or before a cognitive work bout and I suggest that you explore them in the same way because that's going to deliver you to the best possible protocols for you which only you can determine and then of course there's the category of supplements that can support cognitive function and focus but that also touch on other General functions related to brain and body Health such as metabolic Health mood Etc and the one that comes to mind here are the omega-3 fatty acids I've talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids that are available in the form of foods so for instance fatty ocean fish there's certain plant-based sources for these as well certain algaes and things of that sort touched on this in the episodes on depression that I've done but this topic mainly comes up around the issue of fish oil fish oil capsules and liquid and this is a discussion I think is worth having early on in the episode we talked about foundational nutrition and supplements that include a bunch of different ingredients we touched on the idea that some people might have the budget to take one such product or any number of different products that combine all those ingredients I should say that for those that are interested in taking a supplement but have a lower budget than would allow for taking one of those General categories of supplements we talked about earlier for foundational nutrition that combines everything vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes I do think that there's a category of supplements that can greatly enhance the probability of offsetting depression and maybe even improve mood directly or indirectly there's evidence for what I'm about to tell you within the scientific literature and or offset the amount of antidepressant medication that people need to take that's also been demonstrated and improve metabolic function cardiovascular function and also enhance our ability to do focused work and here I'm referring to the so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids in particular the omega-3 form of the essential fatty acids there's now a lot of data showing that ingesting one to three grams of EPA in particular in the form of either fish oil capsules or liquid can be beneficial for a number of different aspects of brain and body health and can enhance focus and cognitive ability this is especially true in developing brains and there's actually an extensive data out of a laboratory at University of California Santa Barbara talking about how mothers who supplement Omega-3s in particular the epas although they also need to get the dhas that leads to Greater brain weights and health of Offspring this is something we will definitely explore in a future episode likely with an expert guest who's doing that work in that laboratory at UC Santa Barbara the point here is that if somebody has a limited budget to purchase supplements and cannot afford a foundational supplement in the sort that we talked about earlier athletic greens are similar but they do have a budget that would allow them to purchase a high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil that would and to ingest it in quantity sufficient enough to get above that one gram of EPA per day again this is really important if you look at the product labels you'll often see you know 1500 or 1600 milligrams of essential fatty acids but the key is you get above that one gram of EPA per day threshold and as high as three grams per day we had a guest on this podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick who takes anywhere from I believe three to four maybe even more grams of EPA per day for a variety of reasons including some of the reasons we're discussing now before we move on to discussing some of the more Global themes related to developing a rational supplementation protocol I do want to touch on this vast category of supplementation that includes food-based or food mimic type supplements so this would be for instance whey proteins or milk proteins or egg proteins or plant proteins that's a discussion that in and of itself deserves an entire episode if you want to understand which types of protein and source of proteins are going to be the most bioavailable the best for protein synthesis for recovery from exercise building muscle Etc I'd like to refer you to a segment within the episode that I did with Dr Lane Norton where he talks about total protein needs per day it's about one gram per pound of body weight per day for most people although there's some variation depending on activity Etc and the quality of sourcing of those various proteins is extremely important and that of course leads to a discussion about the quality and type of protein that would be present in a supplement like a whey protein supplement or casein which is a milk protein based supplement that discussion is segmented and time stamped in the episode that I did with them you can find at hubermanlab.com he actually pointed to some interesting data on potato protein as perhaps being a great plant-based substitute for those that don't want to take whey-based protein but the fact that whey-based proteins can be very useful for getting to and above a protein threshold for all sorts of reasons not just for muscle building although it's great for that but for other purposes as well and that's about one category of food-based or food mimic type supplements there are for instance branched chain amino acids there are for instance green tea supplements there's a huge landscape of this far too much for us to get into in any kind of um reasonable detail but I do want to acknowledge that those all exist the key thing to understand is that while they can serve a great role in providing replacement for meals that you perhaps couldn't have consumed otherwise and while they often are very convenient because you can drink as opposed to eat your calories I think that most people would agree that getting some significant fraction of your nutrition from Whole Foods is going to be useful for a variety of reasons in particular the fiber that comes along with it the bulk of the food that tends to make us feel sated and of course the fact that a lot of vitamins and minerals and other things that are contained within Foods as well as essential fatty acids in foods like animal-based proteins are not going to be present in most if not all of those kind of food mimic type powders and replacements for food another point is this question about age-related effects so for instance should kids be taking supplements well I mentioned earlier that there's some evidence that making sure that kids are getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can be beneficial they certainly could get those from food-based sources just look up online food-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids and epas and you'll see lists there some people choose to supplement on top of that in particular in kids that are developing very quickly I regardless of whether or not they're consuming enough epa's from food some parents choose to supplement on top of that I am personally not a fan of children taking melatonin for the reason that melatonin is already chronically elevated in kids and there's a growing body of literature that melatonin supplementation in kids can be potentially harmful I don't want to create alarm among those who've already been taking it or giving it to their kids or that gave it to their kids in the past but I do think that melatonin in particular should be approached with a lot of caution especially for kids and then of course there's the issue of whether or not all these other supplements that we've discussed whether or not kids can take them safely and again it's highly individual I would say that for the supplements that relate to hormone augmentation and support unless your physician a board-certified MD specifically recommends them I would strongly suggest avoiding intake of those things until at least after puberty and probably in to the late teens and early 20s because the body and brain are still developing and hormone systems are still active even though puberty may happen between ages you know 11 and 14 or even 15. puberty can be a long lasting event with a long taper and tail on it so you want to be cautious about augmenting hormones in young people through the use of supplementation unless a physician is working very closely with you or rather you with them and then in ages of say 22 years old 24 and older I don't see any reason why people who are in their 50s or 60s would have any different protocols than people in their 30s and 40s except perhaps in the domain of cognitive enhancement where it might make sense again might provide it it can be done safely and with the consult of a physician it might be beneficial for people who are approaching their later years to consider increasing dosages or the variety of things and approaches that they take for cognitive enhancement because age-related cognitive decline is a reality there is no person that escapes that the question is whether or not the slope of that decline is very steep or very shallow and of course this is an opportunity for me to raise the point that I made much earlier and that I'll make over and over again because it really is the most important point to today's discussion which is that behaviors both exercise sleep making sure that your relationship to light getting sufficient sunlight early in the day and throughout the day if you can and limiting your viewing of bright artificial light in the late evening and especially between the hours of 10 pm and 4 a.m things of that sort all the do's and don'ts and of course cardiovascular exercise and resistance training exercise and maybe even flexibility training exercise topics we've covered extensively on this podcast and for which we'll soon have a special series airing with Dr Andy Galpin that gets into a lot of detail and protocol development that you can all employ all of that needs to be done at every age certainly past puberty in order to maximize cognitive function in order to maximize cardiovascular function in order to maximize focus and every aspect that we really all stand to and want to enhance when we think about supplementation so again get your sleep right do that by getting your relationship to light right get your exercise right Quality Social connection right and then of course there's that landscape of nutrition that we talked about extensively earlier and for which we have other episodes that really dive deep including that episode or I should say in particular that episode with Dr Lane Norton where we really took a full survey of the landscape of nutrition everything from protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome it's a deep deep discussion with a lot of actionable takeaways if you're curious about nutrition and in particular if you're a vegan or vegetarian or carnivore based but even for the more common omnivores such as myself I found that to be an incredible Learning Journey thanks to Dr Lane Norton just so much useful knowledge in that episode if you want to learn more about nutrition the behavioral tools the nutritional tools are really going to serve as the primary two layers upon which your supplementation Protocols are going to rest and again I want to emphasize that your supplementation protocol may be zero supplements it could include no supplements whatsoever and that would be perfectly fine provided that you're sleeping as well as you want to and need to you're able to focus and work as well as you want to and need to you're able to perform physically as well as you want to and need to and you feel that your hormones and related functions are where you want them however for most people who are doing most everything right they want to explore how they can make things like their sleep their focus their hormone function even better and that's where supplementation makes a lot of sense and when I say it makes a lot of sense I mean it makes a lot of sense to explore in a rational and regimented way there are a couple of big themes that we've talked about a few times during today's podcast that I'd like to reiterate now because they are so crucial to developing a rational supplementation protocol the most important of which is unless we're talking about foundational nutritional support that is coverage of vitamins minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens we should really be focusing on single ingredient formulations foundational supplements that include all those things I just listed off all combined in One supplement are fine I simply don't see any other practical or reasonable way to get each and every one of those things through single ingredient formulations however when you want to start thinking about and actually practically exploring things like supplementation for sleep or Hormone Health or cognitive function the single ingredient formulations are going to give you the most power and control they're going to make sure that you can find the minimal effective doses that you can rule out things that are not effective for you or that may be detrimental for you in whatever fashion and it's not just about cost Effectiveness it's also about arriving at small kits or cocktails of supplements that you can really manage and work with that you're not dependent on but that you really feel can augment the various aspects of your health that are important to you so that's really what today's episode is about even though we had coverage of specific supplements and their functions in these different domains of mental and physical health and performance today's episode was really geared toward giving you resources and a framework to think about how to approach supplementation how to navigate sticking points and pain points in supplementation how to get the most out of your supplementation regimen without spending an excessive amount of money and if you don't have finances to allow for a lot of exploration of supplements how to narrow in on the most effective supplements the most quickly and derive all the benefits that you can from them and as a final point the that is redundant with a few of the themes we talked about today but that I don't think I ever really explicitly stated is that while the word supplement makes it sound like these compounds are something just to add on top of or compensate for deficiencies in nutrition or other areas of your life many of them are actually quite potent compounds these are potent non-prescription molecules that really can move the needle in terms of your ability to think more clearly sleep better support your hormone function but as always they are just one element within an ecosystem of other factors such as your behaviors which includes do's and don'ts such as your nutrition maybe even such as prescription drugs that you also might happen to be taking or hoping to be taking less of or removing completely again that has to be done in discussion with Physicians if you're going to do it at all but the real Point here is that what we call supplements are actually a powerful gear within a larger system aimed at each and every one of us customizing tools for our mental physical health and performance if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube

Title: Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab 105
Published: 2023-01-02 13:00:00 UTC
Description:
My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Sam Harris. Dr. Sam Harris did his undergraduate training in philosophy at Stanford University and then went on to do his doctorate in neuroscience at the University of California at Los Angeles. He is well known as an author who has written about everything from meditation to consciousness, free will. And he holds many strong political views that he's voiced on social media and in the content of various books as they relate to philosophy and neuroscience. During today's episode, I mainly talk to Dr. Harris about his views and practices related to meditation, consciousness, and free will. In fact, he made several important points about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish. Prior to this episode, I thought that meditation was about deliberately changing one's conscious experience in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation, a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally, elevated memory, and so on. What Sam taught me and what you'll soon learn as well is that while meditation does indeed hold all of those valuable benefits, the main value of a meditation practice, or perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice, is that it doesn't just allow one to change their conscious experience, but it actually can allow a human being to view consciousness itself. That is to understand what the process of consciousness is. And in doing so, to profoundly shift the way that one engages with the world and with oneself in all practices, all environments, and at all times, both in sleep and in waking states. And in that way making meditation perhaps the most potent and important portal by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being and viewing one's life experience. We also discussed the so-called mind-body problem and issues of duality and free will. Concepts from philosophy and neuroscience that, fortunately, thanks to valuable experiments and deep thinking on the part of people like Dr. Sam Harris and others, is now leading people to understand really what free will is and isn't. Where the locus of free will likely sits in the brain, if it indeed resides in the brain at all. And what it means to be a conscious being and how we can modify our conscious states in ways that allow us to be more functional. We also discuss perception, both visual perception auditory perception, and especially interesting to me, and I think as well, hopefully to you, time perception, which we know is very elastic in the brain. The literal frame rate by which we process our conscious experience can expand and contract dramatically depending on our state of mind and how conscious we are about our state of mind. So we went deep into that topic as well. Today's discussion was indeed an intellectual deep dive into all the topics that I mentioned a few moments ago, but it also included many practical tools. In fact, I pushed Sam to share with us what his specific practices are and how we can all arrive at a clearer and better understanding of a meditation practice that we can each and all apply. So that we can derive these incredible benefits, not just the ones related to stress and focus and enhanced memory, but the ones that relate to our consciousness. That is to our deeper sense of self and to others. Several times during today's episode, I mentioned the Waing Up app. The Waking Up app was developed by Sam Harris, but I want to emphasize that my mention of the app is in no way a paid promotional. Rather the Waking Up app is one that I've used for some period of time now and find very, very useful. I have family members that also use it. Other staff members here at the Huberman Lab podcast use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool. Sam has generously offered Huberman Lab podcast listeners a 30-day completely free trial of the Waking Up app. If any of you want to try it, you can simply go to wakingup.com/huberman to get that 30-day free trial. During today's discussion, we didn't just talk about meditation consciousness and free will. We also talked about psychedelics. Both their therapeutic applications for the treatment of things like depression and PTSD, but also the use of psychedelics. And we discussed Sam's experiences with psychedelics as they relate to expanding one's consciousness. I also asked Sam about his views and practices related to social media. Prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision to close down his Twitter account. So we talked about his rationale for doing that, how he feels about doing that. And I think you'll find that to be very interesting as well. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real-time feedback using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors in your immediate and long-term health are your blood sugar levels. And not just your overall blood sugar levels but your blood sugar levels throughout the day in response to different foods you eat, to fasting if you're into fasting, to exercise, and so forth. I started using Levels some time ago in order to figure out how different foods impact my blood sugar levels, and indeed, it does that very well. It allowed me to see how certain foods really spike my blood sugar and others keep it more level. And in particular, how foods that I eat after exercise can help raise my blood glucose just enough but not so much that then I get a crash two or three hours later, which was what was happening before I started using Levels. I've made certain adjustments to my diet. I can now eat post-exercise and still have plenty of energy throughout the day without any issues. It also has helped me understand how different behaviors impact my blood glucose levels. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Again that's levels.link spelled L-I-N-K /huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by WHOOP. WHOOP is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking to provide real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better. Six months ago, I started working with WHOOP as a member of their scientific advisory council as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance. And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear, based on quality research, that WHOOP can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits. Even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle in order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance. So whether or not you're an athlete or you're exercising simply for health, WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions and how to really program your schedule, nutrition and exercise, and many other factors of your life in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition. If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP spelled whoop.com/huberman. That's join whoop.com/huberman today and get your first month free. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep every single night is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment. Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And waking up, on the other hand, involves a heating of your body by about 1 to 3 degrees. With Eight sleep, you can tune the temperature of your mattress cover or mattress to be cooler or hotter depending on whether or not you tend to run too hot or too cold. And you can even vary it across the night so that you can access the best deep sleep early in the night. The so-called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, that's more pronounced in the later half of the night. And doing so really get your sleep optimized not just in terms of duration but in terms of quality and the overall architecture of your sleep. This has a profound influence on your alertness, focus, mood, and many other important factors throughout the day. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $150 off their pod three cover. Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again that's eightsleep.com/huberman.

And now, for my discussion with Dr. Sam Harris. Dr. Sam Harris. SAM HARRIS: [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're just talking about this. SAM HARRIS: Yes, doctor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You are indeed a doctor. [INTERPOSING VOICES] SAM HARRIS: I cannot save your life, but I am-- I might save your non-existent soul if we talk long enough. ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHTER] Well, neither of us are clinicians, but we are both brain explorers from the different perspectives. Some overlapping. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm really excited to have this conversation. I've been listening to your voice for many years learning from you for many years. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that my father, who's also a scientist, is an enormous fan of your Waking Up app. SAM HARRIS: Nice. That's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And has spent a lot of time over the last few years. He's in his late 70s. He's almost 80. He's a theoretical physicist walking to the park near his apartment and spending time meditating with the app. Or sometimes separate from the app but using the same sorts of meditations in his head. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he kind of toggles back and forth. And even-- I shouldn't say-- even but-- yes, even in his late 70s, has reported that it has significantly shifted his awareness of self and his conscious experience of things happening in and around him. And he was somebody who, I think, already saw himself as a pretty aware person. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thinking about quantum mechanics and the rest. So a thank you from him indirectly. SAM HARRIS: Oh, that's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A thank you from me now directly. And I really want to use that as a way to frame up what I think is one of the more interesting questions in not just science and philosophy and psychology but all of life, which is what is this thing that we call a self? As far as I know, we have not localized the region in the brain that can entirely account for our perception of self. There are areas, of course, that regulate proprioception, our awareness of where our limbs are in space. Maybe even our awareness of where we are in physical space. There are such circuits, as we both know. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But when we talk about sense of self, I have to remember this kind of neuroscience 101 thing that we always say. When you teach memory, you say you wake up every morning, and you remember who you are. You know who you are. Most people do. Even if they lack memory systems in the brain for whatever reason, pretty much everyone seems to know who they are. What are your thoughts on what that whole thing is about? And do we come into the world feeling that way? I would appreciate answers from the perspective of any field-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --including neuroscience, of course. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Well, big question. I mean, the problem is we use the term self in so many different ways, right. And there's one sense of that term, which is the target of meditation, and it's the target of deconstruction by the practice and by, as you said, any surrounding philosophy. So you'll hear, and you'll hear it from me, that this self is an illusion, right. And that there's a psychological freedom that can be experienced on the other side of discovering it to be an illusion. And some people don't like that framing. Some people would insist that it's not so much an illusion, but it's a construct, and it's not what it seems, right. But it's not that every use of the term self is illegitimate. And there are certain types of selves that are not illusory. I mean, I'm not saying that people are illusions. I'm not saying that you can't talk about yourself as distinct-- yourself as the whole person and with as psychological continuity with your past experience as being distinct from the person and psychological continuity of some other person, right. I mean-- because obviously, we have to be able to conserve those data. It's not fundamentally mysterious that you're going to wake up tomorrow morning still being psychologically continuous with your past and not my past, right. And if we swapped lives, that would demand some explanation. So the illusorines of the self doesn't cut against any of those obvious facts. So the sense of self that is illusory. And again, we might want to talk about self in other modes because there's just a lot of interest there psychologically and ultimately scientifically. The thing that doesn't exist-- it certainly doesn't exist as it seems and I would want to argue that it actually is just a proper illusion, is this the sense that there is a subject interior to experience in addition to experience. So most people feel like they're having an experience of the world. And they're having their-- an experience of their bodies in the world. And in addition to that, they feel that they are a subject internal to the body, very likely in the head. Most people feel like they're behind their face as a kind of locus of awareness and thought and intention and that every-- it's almost like they're-- you're a passenger inside your body. You don't-- most people don't feel identical to their bodies. And they can imagine this is sort of the origin, the psychological origin, the folk psychological origin, of a sense of that there might be a soul that could survive the death of the body. I mean, most people are what my friend Paul Blum calls common sense do lists. You-- you're just the default expectation seems to be that whatever the relationship between the mind and the body, there is this-- there's some promise of separability there, right. That the-- and whenever you really push hard on the science side and say, well, no, no, the mind is really just what the brain is doing, that begins to feel more and more counterintuitive to people, and there still seems some residual mystery that at death maybe something is going to lift off the brain and go elsewhere, right. So there's this sense of dualism that many people have. And obviously, that's supported by many religious beliefs. But this feeling it is a very peculiar starting point. People feel that in a-- they don't feel identical to their experience. As a matter of experience, they feel like they're on the edge of experience. Somehow appropriating it from the side. You kind of on the edge of the world. And the world is out there. Your body is, in some sense, an object in the world which is different from the world. The boundary of your skin is still meaningful. You can sort of loosely control your body. I mean, you can't control it-- you can control your gross and subtle voluntary motor movements, but you can't-- you're not controlling everything your body is doing. You're not controlling your heartbeat and your hormonal secretions and all of that. And so there's a lot that's going on that is in the dark for you. And then you give someone an instruction to meditate, say. And you say, OK, well, let's examine all of this from the first person side. Let's look for this thing you're calling I. And again, I is not identical to the body. People feel like their hands are out there. And when-- if they're going to meditate, they're going to close their eyes very likely. And now they're going to pay attention to something. They're going to pay attention to the breath or the sounds. And it's from the point of view of being a locus of attention that is now aiming attention strategically at an object, like the breath, that there's this dualism that is set up. And ultimately, the ultimate promise of meditation. I mean, there are really two levels at which you could be interested in meditation. One is very straightforward and remedial and non paradoxical and very well subscribed. And it's the usual set of claims about all the benefits you're going to get from meditation. So you're going to lower your stress, and you're going to increase your focus, and you're going to stave off cortical thinning, and there's all kinds of good things that science is saying meditation will give you. And none of that entails really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion or anything else of that sort. But from my point of view, the real purpose of meditation and its real promise is not in this long list of benefits. And I'm not discounting any of those though the science for many of them is quite provisional. It's in this deeper claim that if you look for this thing you're calling I. If you look for the sense that there's a thinker in addition to the mirror rising of the next thought, say, you won't find that thing. And you can-- what's more, you cannot find it in a way that's conclusive and that matters, right. And it has-- there's a host of benefits that follow from that discovery which are quite a bit deeper and more interesting than engaging meditation on the side of its benefits. You know, de-stressing, increasing focus, and all the rest. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a number of questions related-- SAM HARRIS: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to what you just said. And first of all, I agree that the evidence that meditation can improve focus, reduce stress, et cetera. It's there. It's not an enormous pile of evidence, but it's growing. And-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think that especially for some of the shorter meditations, which I these days view more as perceptual exercises. I've talked about this in the podcast before. But for those who haven't heard it before about perception. You can have extra perception extending to things beyond the confines of your skin. Interception, which is, I think, also includes the surface of the skin but everything inward. And meditation through eyes closed typically involving some sort of attentional spotlighting, something we'll get into more. Interior receptive versus external receptive events, et cetera, including thoughts. And-- so I think of-- at a basic level meditation as somewhat of a perceptual exercise. You can tell me where you disagree there, and I would expect and hope that you would. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I would like to just touch on this idea that you brought up because it's such an interesting one. Of this idea that our bodies are containers and that we somehow view ourselves as passengers within those containers. That's certainly been my experience. And the image that I have is of-- as you say, that is of myself or of people out there that sit a few centimeters below the surface or that sit entirely in their head. And, of course, the brain and body are connected through the nervous system. I think sometimes a brain is used to replace a nervous system, and that can get us into trouble in terms of coming up with real directions and definitions. But the point is that there is something special about the real estate in the head. I think for as much as my laboratory, and many other scientists are really interested in brain-body connections through the nervous system and other organ systems that the nervous system binds that if you cut off all my limbs, I'm going to be different, but I'm fundamentally still Andrew. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas if we were to lesion a couple of square millimeters out of my parietal cortex, it's an open question as to whether or not I would still seem as much like Andrew to other people and to myself-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --even. And so there is something fundamentally different about the real estate in the cranial vault. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. I mean, we are-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can even remove both of my eyes, I'd still be Andrew. And those are two pieces of my central nervous system that are fundamental to my daily life, but I'd still be me. Whereas-- and this doesn't, I think, just apply to memory systems. I mean, I think there are regions of the frontal cortex that, when destroyed, have been shown to modify personality and self-perception in dramatic ways. So it's a sort of obvious point once it's made, but I do think it's worth highlighting because there does seem to be something special about being in the head. The other thing is that sitting a few centimeters below the surface or riding in this container makes sense to me. Except I wonder if you've ever experienced a shift as I have when something very extreme happens. Let's use the negative example of all of a sudden you're in a fear state. All of a sudden, it feels as if your entire body is you or is me. And now I need to get this thing-- the whole container and me to some place of safety in whatever form. This is also true, I think, in ecstatic states-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where you can feel really-- when people say embodied, I wonder whether or not we normally oscillate below the surface of our body. When I say oscillate, I mean in neural terms. I mean, maybe our sensory experience is not truly at the bodily surface but sits below the bodily surface more at the level of organ systems and within our head. And then certain things that jolt us-- our autonomic nervous system into heightened states bring us into states of-- bring us closer to the surface and therefore include all of us. Again, I don't want to take us down a mechanistic description of something that doesn't exist. But does any of that resonate in terms of how you are thinking about or describing the self? SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah. There's a lot there. First, on the point of the brain being the locus of what we are as minds. Yeah, I mean, there are people who will insist that sort of the whole nervous system has to be thought of as a-- when you're talking about our emotional life and the insulas connection to the gut. And just the sense of self extends beyond the brain. But I totally take your point that a brain transplant is a coherent idea, and you would expect to go with the brain rather than with the viscera. And so, in that sense, we really are the old philosophical thought experiment of being a brain in a VAT. I mean, we essentially are already-- the VAT is our skull, and we're virtually in that situation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A horrible movie. I'm sorry I can't help but interrupt. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I was a teenager, my sister and I used to go to the movies every once in a while, and we'd trade off who could pick the movie. And she took me to see once the movie Boxing Helena. SAM HARRIS: Oh yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The David Lynch film-- SAM HARRIS: Which I never saw that again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where he amputates the limbs of a woman who he's obsessed by and keeps her. It's a really horrible-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --film. And about 20 minutes into it, my sister just turned to me and said, I'm so sorry. And the question there was whether or not two siblings should actually persist in a movie like that. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we decided to persist in the movie so that we could laugh about it later. But it was rather disturbing. I don't recommend the movie. Nor do I recommend seeing it with a sibling. But in that movie, the woman, he takes her as a container and restricts her movement. Quite sadistic and horrible thing really. David Lynch, interesting mind perhaps. But the idea was to question how much of the person persists in the absence of their ability to move, et cetera. Could there be love? Could there be these other affections? Anyway, a rather extreme example. But one that still haunts me. And I suppose I'm thinking about still now. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. SAM HARRIS: Well, so just to follow that point, there's a lot about us that we don't have access to unless we enact it physically. Like if I ask you, do you still know how to ride a bike? There's no place in your memory where you can inspect but just sitting in your chair that you've retained the knowledge of how to ride a bike. Procedural memory is different from semantic or episodic memory. If I asked you, do you know your address? Yes, you can recall your address just sitting there. But if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out your ability to ride a bike and left everything else intact, you might think you could ride a bike. But suddenly, you stand up next to one. And you have no idea what to do with it. And that would be a discovery that would only happen if you were motorically engaged with that object. And I'm sure we could probably come up with 100 things about us that really seem core to us and not separable from our personhood which seemed to only get invoked when we're out they're moving in the world, and we have limbs, et cetera. No, it's the seat of consciousness, the right framework to talk about all of this, from my point of view, is consciousness and its contents. So we have consciousness. The fact that there's something that is like to be us, the fact that the world and our internal experience is illuminated. It has a qualitative character. And then, there's the question of what is that qualitative character? What kinds of information do we have access to? What does it feel like to be us? How do different states of arousal change that? So you talked about fear. Yeah, fear can change a lot of things. And various neurological deficits, or you can add drugs to the mix. You add psychedelics that radically transform the contents of consciousness. From my point of view, consciousness itself is simply the cognizance, the awareness, that is the flood lights by which any of that stuff appears. So consciousness doesn't change. But its contents change. And to come back to meditation for a second, many people think meditation is about changing the contents of consciousness. There are some contents you want to get rid of like anxiety. Other contents you want to encourage, like calm, and unconditional love, or some other classically pleasant, prosocial emotion. And that's all fine. That's all possible. But the real wisdom of the 2000-year-old wisdom of meditation that really is the chewy center of the Tootsie Pop is a recognition of what consciousness itself is always already like regardless of the contents in it and the changes in contents. And this is why we might talk about this. But this is why they're mutually compatible. Psychedelics and meditation, for me, are somewhat orthogonal. Because psychedelics is all about making wholesale changes to the contents of consciousness. And there's some wonderful consequences of doing that. There can be some harrowing and terrifying consequences of doing that. But generally speaking, I think used wisely, they can be incredibly valuable. And the therapeutic potential there is enormous. But the crucial disjunction here is that there really is something to recognize about ordinary waking consciousness, the consciousness that's compatible with my driving a car to get here on time. You don't have to have the pyrotechnics of being on LSD to see to transcend the central illusion that I'm saying is the thing to be transcended, which is the sense that there is a duality between subject and object in every moment of experience. And to take it back to something you said about just all of our different modes in ordinary life, the interesting thing is I think people are constantly losing their sense of self. And they're not aware of it. And there's probably an analogy to the visual system here, which is to visual saccade, which perhaps you've spoken about at some point on your podcast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not enough. So please. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. So what happens every time we move our eyes, this is called a saccade. And we do that about three times a second or so just normally. There is the region of motor cortex that affects that movement sends what's called an efferent copy of that motor movement, which is used as information that propagates back to visual cortex, that suppresses the data of vision while the eyes are moving. Because otherwise if you weren't doing that, every time you moved your eyes, it would seem like the visual scene itself was lurching around. And people can experience this for themselves if they just touch one of their eyeballs on the side, not all that hard, and kind of jiggle it. And then, you can roll it around. You can jiggle it from side to side. You can see a movement of the eyeball that's not governed by your oculomotor system delivers a jiggling of the world. Because your brain is not anticipating it in the same way. And you're not producing that same predictive copy of the movement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a little bit like-- we have some action sports filmmakers on our staff here that the gimbal, that holds an iPhone, like you see the kids on surfboards or skateboards or something. They're going to hold a phone while moving around or the people, the vloggers-- does anyone even still use that for phrase? SAM HARRIS: I don't know. I guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Moving around and it's image stabilization, essentially, that keeps the camera steady. And these are more than cameras, of course, for those listening, point at my eyes. But they do far more than just what a camera would do. But this internal system of image stabilization, I can see perhaps where you're going with this, that it allows us to remain in a self-referencing scheme, as opposed to paying attention to just how confusing it is to track the visual world at some level. SAM HARRIS: Well, actually where I'm going is, that people are having this suppression of vision three times a second on average. And they're not experiencing it. You're effectively going blind. And you're not noticing it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very fast. SAM HARRIS: Yes, it's very fast. Now there's an analogous suppression, I would say, of the sense of self that occurs every time attention gets absorbed significantly in its object. We even have this concept of losing yourself in your work. Classic flow experiences have this quality. And this tends to be why they're so rewarding. If you're in some athletic activity or an aesthetic one, or you could be having sex, or whatever it is, some peak experience, its peakness usually entails there being some brief period where there was no distance between you and the experience. For that moment, you were no longer looking over your own shoulder or anticipating the next moment or trying to get somewhere, where you weren't, or micromanaging errors. There's just the flow of unity with whatever the experience is, a surfer on the wave. And we love those experiences. And then we are continually abstracted away from them by our thinking about them. We're thinking, oh my god, that was so good, or how do I get back to that? Or you're looking at a sunset. It's the most beautiful sunset you've ever seen. And then you're continually interrupting the experience of merely seeing it with a commentary about how amazing this is. And I wonder, what real estate prices are here? I mean, is it possible that I could move here. And your mind is just continually narrating a conversation you're having with yourself, however paradoxically. I mean, you're telling yourself things that you already know as though there are two of you rather often. I'm looking for-- which is the water. And it's, oh, there it is. But I'm the one seeing it. Who am I saying, oh, there it is to. Is there someone else who needs to be informed about the thing I already saw. So there's something about our internal dialogue that is paradoxical. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there any neurologic condition call it soulectomy or anything like that where somehow people feel more unified with the self on a continual basis, the observer and the actor within? State more as a complete sentence. Is there any known neurological syndrome-- makes it sound like a bad thing, but it could be a good thing. --whereby people feel that the actor and the observer within them are unified continually? SAM HARRIS: There's not a pathological one. Some the work on the default-mode network suggests that that's at least part of the story. So the default-mode network, which has been talked about a lot of late because it has come up both in the meditation literature and in the psychedelic literature. But its original discovery was that-- and the reason why I was called the default mode was is that in virtually every neuroimaging experiment ever run, they found that between tasks, when the brain was just in its default state, these midline structures would increase their activity. And then they would reliably diminish whenever the person in the scanner was on task. And usually, that meant some outward looking visual discrimination task. But it could be visual. It could be semantic. But it tends to be their eyes are open. And they're paying attention to something that's being broadcast to them through monitor goggles, or they're looking at a mirror that's showing them a computer monitor. But so the general insight was, there are these midline structures in the brain that seem to be increasing their activity when the brain is idling between tasks, waiting for something to happen. And then further experiments found tasks that actually upregulated activity there beyond baseline. And those tasks seem to be self referential. So that when you ask people-- you give them a list of words. And you say, well, do any of these apply to you? Or you ask people to think about-- Actually, one experiment I did. When you're challenging people's beliefs, when you're challenging beliefs that have more of a personal significance, like political or religious beliefs, you get an upregulation in these regions as opposed to just generic beliefs about you're in Los Angeles. This is a table. That is something to which people are not holding fast as a matter of identity. So anyway, both meditation and psychedelics seem to suppress activity in these regions, which we know are associated with both self-talk, mind-wandering, and explicit acts of self representation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could we say that they are somewhat autobiographical because they access memory systems? And in the way you're describing them, and in the way that a colleague of mine, who's been a guest on this podcast-- I don't know if you've interacted with him before. But I think you'd very much enjoy whatever interaction you would have. --is David Spiegel. He's our associate chair of psychiatry. He and his father actually-- his father then he founded hypnosis as a valid clinical practice in psychiatry. And hypnosis, which is obviously a heightened sense of attention with deep relaxation, is known to dramatically suppress the default-mode network. He talks about this a lot. And I always wonder as we take down activity within the default-mode network, what what surfaces in its place, does that somehow reflect that the two are normally in a push-pull? Because that's not necessarily the case. When I fall asleep, I can hallucinate. But that doesn't mean that during the day, the fact that I'm looking at objects is what's preventing me from hallucinating. If I close my eyes, I can get imagery. But there's this different illusion, the illusion of antagonistic circuitry sometimes. I don't want to take us off course, but the default-mode network seems to "want to be there," quote, unquote. It seems to be fighting for our attention, unless we give ourselves a visual target, or an auditory target, or some salient experience of some kind, it sounds like. And then, I'm surprised to hear that meditation reduces activity in the default-mode network at some level because meditation to me oftentimes involves paying attention to some perceptual target. Maybe you could eventually explain as to how it might do that or why it might. SAM HARRIS: And I don't think it's the whole story because, obviously, outward-going attention is not-- even if you're having the kind of egoic saccade that I'm talking about, where you're actually not clearly aware of yourself. You're not clearly defining yourself as separate from experience for the moment of paying attention, so you are sort of losing yourself in your work. That's not the same thing as having the clear meditative insight of selflessness that I'm claiming is the goal of meditation. But to wind back to the original point I was making, and the reason why I drew the analogy to visual saccades, I do think there's a continuous interruption in our sense of self that goes unrecognized. But the conscious acquisition of the understanding that the self is an illusion is a different experience because you're then focusing on this absence. Actually, there's another analogy to the visual system that applies here, which is to the optic blind spot, which is a good analogy for me because it cuts through a bunch of false assumptions as to where you would look for this or how this relates to ordinary experience. So as many people know that in both eyes we have what's called the blind spot, which is a consequence of the optic nerve transiting through the retina, unlike cephalopods. I think cephalopods have their optic nerve, as an omniscient being would have engineered it, connecting the retina from the back. And therefore, there is no area of blindness associated with its transit back through the retina. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But our receptors are one the outside. SAM HARRIS: Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Humans, for whatever reason, put photoreceptors-- well, I always say I wasn't consulted on the design phase. Something put photoreceptors, combination of things, put photoreceptors in the back. And so you actually have to send the highway of information through the pixel center of the eye. Cephalopods and drosophila, basically invertebrates, the design is more at its face logical. Mammals, very illogical design, at least as far as our judgments go. SAM HARRIS: But it gives me a good analogy. So I'll take it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin-mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs. So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, adaptogens to combat stress. And the digestive enzymes really help my digestion. I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And for the month of January, they have a special offer where they'll give you 10 free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer in the month of January of 10 free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2. SAM HARRIS: So in any case, we have this blind spot, which I think most people learn this in school. Although, my daughters had not been taught this in school. I just showed them this for the first time a month ago. And they were briefly fascinated. And then they went to return to their screen time. But anyway, you can take a piece of paper. And you make two marks on it. And then you cover one eye. And you fixate on one mark. I mean, you can look this up online if you need details about how to do this. And while staring at one fixation point, you move the paper back and forth. And you can get it to a place where the other mark disappears. And you can run this experiment long enough to satisfy yourself that there is in fact a blind spot in your visual field, which with one eye closed you don't normally notice. The reason why you have to cover one eye is because each eye compensates for the blind spot of the other. Which is to say that if you close one eye and survey the visual scene, something really is missing, whatever you're looking at. If you're looking at a crowd of people, somebody is missing a head and you're not noticing it. And it's not easy to notice because the brain doesn't tend to vividly represent the absence of information. I mean, it's just part of the game that's not being rendered. It's not showing up as a break in the visual field. It's just not there. And I mean, people have argued that there's a filling-in phenomenon that happens, but I think that can be misunderstood or exaggerated. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But the eye movements themselves, that you described before-- I guess, I should say that the saccade analogy about transiently and repetitively erasing the self works perfectly here because, indeed, microsaccades, little smaller saccades, occur all the time also prevent our eyes from fixating in one location long enough to observe our blind spot, even if one eye is closed. So if the experiment's done with paralytics to essentially lock eyes at one location, basically, things start disappearing. SAM HARRIS: It just fades away. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We all love to think that we start hallucinating, but actually, we start going blind. And those experiments have been done on humans. I hear they're quite terrifying. SAM HARRIS: I mean, you can do that for yourself too. It begins to just all melt away in a warm glow. No psychedelics required. But the interesting point there is that when you ask yourself, OK, so because as a consequence of the eyes' anatomy, there's this thing you can see that is absent from your experience. But the question is, where is that in relationship to the rest of you, to your mind? Is that deep within? Or is that in some sense right on the surface of experience? And there's expectation that people have. Again, I think conflating meditation with a search for changes in the context of consciousness. They're looking for much more subtle things to notice about the mind or much vaster things to notice. Psychedelics sets up this expectation that you do a massive dose of mushrooms or LSD, and everything changes. I mean, you get this full beatific vision. And you get not only visual changes, but emotional changes. And you get synesthesia, where you have much more mind in so many ways. So they begin having these experiences, or reading the mystical literature, you begin to think, OK, well, then freedom is really elsewhere or it's deep within. It's not coincident with the ordinary awareness that can see this coffee cup clearly and that can just transition attention to reading an email with the full sobriety of ordinary waking consciousness. But the truth is, this insight into selflessness, this insight into the nonduality of subject and object, is as close to ordinary consciousness as this insight into the optic blind spot. Where do you have to go to have this insight into the blind spot? you don't have to go anywhere. You just have to set up the experiment correctly such that you can see the data. But the data is right on the surface. It's almost too close to you to notice. If it's at all hard to notice, it's because it's so close, rather than it's deep within or far away. And there are other analogies like-- I don't even remember. There's Mind's Eye, pieces of artwork, that were the random dot stereo grams, where we have an image that pops out. I always find it very difficult to see those because I have a very dominant eye. But some people can see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can't see those. These images that used to be at the touristy shops. But people say, oh, there it is, the whale. And I'm thinking, I don't see it. Kids that swim a lot when they're younger, and they tend to breathe just to one side-- I don't know if this was you. This was definitely me. They tend to keep one eye closed. You set up a pretty strong ocular dominance. Biasing your vision to one or the other eye early in life, whether or not you're learning how to be a bow hunter or you're learning how to throw darts or shoot billiards or anything that, involves selectively viewing the world through one eye for even a couple of hours can set up a permanent asymmetry in the weighting flow of visual information from the eye to the brain. It's reversible, but only through the reverse gymnastics of covering up the other eye intentionally. So actually I had to be reversed-patched for a while because I was seeing double, because I lost binocular vision. I don't stand a chance in hell of seeing an image pop out of a random dot stereogram, which is kind of ironic because I did my PhD on binocular circuitry. But nonetheless, if people can see these, or if they can't, I think they provide a really terrific example of what you're talking about as a larger theme, which is that perceptually you see a bunch of dots. And then all of a sudden, what you thought wasn't there is suddenly there, but can just disappear again. There are certain visual illusions, if we were to include others, that once you see them, you cannot unsee them. So there's the faces-vases, figure-ground type stuff. SAM HARRIS: Bi-stable percepts. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bi-stable percepts. And then there's sort of ocular competition. You show two different images to the eyes, each of the two eyes. And it is near impossible for people to perceive them both simultaneously. So it's a little bit of what you're describing. I mean, these seem to be fundamental features about the way the neural circuits are organized, that they don't want to stay fixated on any one thing for very long. To do so either takes training, intense interest, intense fear, intense excitement. When I say intense, I guess, I come back to this idea that the autonomic nervous system is somehow governing our ability to spotlight at any one location for very long. Is that a useful framework? Or is that going to take us down a different path? SAM HARRIS: Well, it's sort of a different path for this. I mean, the only point I was making is that the seemingly paradoxical claim that something can be right on the surface and yet hard to see. And again, this seems to justify the expectation held by, I would think, the vast majority of people who get interested in these spiritual things, for lack of a better word, that the truth must somehow be deep within. There's some distance between the one who is looking and the thing that has to be found right and that you have to go through this long evolution of changes. I mean, there are many metaphors that set this up. It's like you're at the base of a mountain, and you have to climb to the top. And so you have to find the path, however secure it is to get you there. But there really is a distance between your starting point and the goal. And what I'm arguing-- and this is a kind of a nondual, to use a term of jargon-- this is a nondual approach to meditation, as opposed to a dualistic one. The path and the goal are coincident, that you have to unravel the logic by which you would seek something that's outside of the present moment's experience, i.e. not available, really not available to you now. Because so many things worth having, so many skills worth acquiring, really are not available to you now. It's like if you want to be a pianist, or if you want to speak Chinese, there's something you don't know. And then you want to learn that thing. And there's a whole process. And you might not be capable of doing it. And real mastery is far away. If you've never hit a golf ball, and you want to hit a golf ball 300 yards straight, I can pretty much guarantee you're not going to do that initially. And you're not going to do it on day two. And you're not going to do it reliably for the longest time. And there's real training in front of you to be able to do that reliably. An insight into, and really the core insight, I mean, the insight that is the core of the Buddha's teaching, to take one historical example of this, really is available now. I mean, granted, it can be very hard, one, for people. I mean, I had probably spent a year on silent retreat in one week to three month increments before I got the point I'm making now. I mean, literally, these are retreats where you spend 12 to 18 hours a day just meditating, trying to unpack the kinds of claims I'm making now. So it's possible to rigorously overlook this. It's possible to stand in front of the mind's eye image and stare in a way that is guaranteed not to give you pop out and to be adept at staring in that way. So it's possible to be misled. And so what I'm trying to argue here is that there's a fair amount of leverage you can get with better information, which can cut the time course of your searching for this thing and cancel your false expectations about just where this is in relation to your ordinary waking consciousness. And it's possible to get bad information and to have a bunch of experiences. You go you go and do an ayahuasca trip. And it's incredibly valuable. And it's valuable for all the ways in which it changed the contents of your consciousness in startling ways. And you had insights into your past and into your relationships and into why you're not as loving as you might be. And there's lots to think about. And you're like, OK, that's all great. That's all something that we can talk about. But it truly is orthogonal. I mean, it makes a point of contact, or what I'm talking about, it's really just at one point. And it's at the point where this sense of subject-object division in consciousness is illusory and vulnerable to investigation. And if you investigate it as the right plane of focus-- you pick the analogy you want, whether it's setting up the optic blind spot experiment in just the right way, so that you can see that the data is not there. I mean, the bi-stable percept is great because when you see one of these images, like the vase-face diagram, or the Dalmatian that it looks like a mess of dots, and then you see the image of a Dalmatian dog pop out-- once you see it, you really can't unsee it. I mean, once you have the requisite conceptual anchor to it, then every time you look, you're going to find it again. And eventually, it becomes effortless. And that's what, ultimately, meditation is, I mean, this kind of meditation. You ultimately learn to recognize that there's no separation between you and your experience. There's not the experience on the one hand and the self on the other. There's just experience. There's just seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, feeling, proprioception, add whatever channels of information you want to that. But there's just the totality of the energy of consciousness and its contents. And it's not that you're on the riverbank. And this is how it can seem in the beginning, even when you're practicing meditation fairly diligently. You can seem like you're on the riverbank, watching the contents of consciousness flow by. And meditation is the act of doing that more and more dispassionately, so you're no longer grabbing at the pleasant or pushing the unpleasant away. You're just kind of relaxing in the most non-judgmental frame of mind, just witnessing the flow. But if you're doing that dualisticly, you feel like the meditator. You feel like the subject aiming attention. And so now you're on the riverbank watching everything go past. But the truth is, you are the river. Experience itself is that there is just experience itself. You're not on the edge of experience. And everything you can notice is part of the flow. And there's no point from which to abstract yourself away from the flow to stand outside it and to say, OK, this is my life. This is my experience. This is my body. Yes, you can do that. I mean, those are all just thoughts. But that's more of the flow. And so there's a process by which you would eventually recognize that there's no distance between you and your experience. And again, you can wait for those moments in life where experience gets so good, or so terrifying, it's just so salient. Your amygdala is driving so hard. I mean, so you're in a war, and you can't think about anything because the enemy is shooting at you. And this is the most thrilling video game you've ever played in your life. And your life is on the line. Or you're at the peak of some athletic event, where you don't know how you're doing the things you're doing, but it's all happening automatically. But those are 1/100 of 1% of one's life. And you know what I'm calling meditation is a way of simply understanding the mechanics of a tension whereby you are denying yourself that unity of experience so much of the time and recognizing that it's based on a misperception of the way consciousness always already is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, if there wasn't an incentive to learn how to meditate properly, that was one. And I've been meditating for a fair amount since I was in my teens, but more along the lines of paying attention to breath and open-observer type meditation, or focused-attention. I would suppose more of the focused-attention type. We'll get into these a little bit later. But I have a number of questions related to what you just said. SAM HARRIS: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love the idea that this thing that we would all do well to understand to observe consciousness of self as opposed to trying to alter the contents of consciousness may sit much closer to us than one might think. And because it sits so close to us, that might be one of the reasons why we miss it. I go right to a visual system example. I mean, if you're wearing corrective lenses and there's a speck on your lens, typically you're looking out through the lens, and so you wouldn't observe that speck. Any number of different analogies could work here. The fact that there are states, however few, positive and negative, extreme ecstasy and extreme fear being the two, I think, most obvious ones that seems like we agree on, that allow us to capture the sense of completeness of self or the unity of the observer and the actor. The fact that those are seldom for the nontrained, for the nonmeditator, suggests to me two things. I think one perhaps worth exploring more than the other. But one is that what's really being revealed in the states where we can feel the unity of the observer and the actor is understanding something fundamental about the algorithm, not the online algorithm, but the algorithm that is our nervous system. Just as you mentioned cephalopods. I mean, mantis shrimp see an enormous array of color hues that we don't. Their maps and representations of the world are fundamentally different. Pit vipers see in the infrared. We're restricted to somewhat of a limited range within the color spectrum, but still more vast than that of dogs or cats. So understanding that for seeing what a pit viper can see for moments would be informative. Perhaps sensing-heat emissions as a human might be invasive, maybe that's why we don't do it. So the question is, to just make it straightforward, why would the system be designed this way? Again, neither of us were consulted in the design phase. But that brings me to, perhaps, the more tractable question was, which is about development. I'm a great believer that the neural circuits that encouraged healthy parent-child relations, or unhealthy parent-child relations as the case may be, in childhood stem from the initial demands of internal versus external states, which is exactly what we're talking about, which is that a young child feels anxious because it needs his diaper change. It doesn't really know it needs its diaper changed or it's cold or it's uncomfortable or it's hungry or it's overly full. And so it vocalizes. And then some external source comes to us and relieves that hopefully. And so the fundamental rule that we first learn is not that we have a self or that things fall down, not up. But it's that when uncomfortable, externalize that discomfort. And it will be relieved by an outside player. And then, of course, there's a repurposing of that circuitry for adult romantic attachments. I don't think anyone doubts that. And that can explain a lot indeed about attachment and so forth. So something about our developmental wiring and the algorithms that these neural circuits run tend to bias most people, the nonpractice meditators, to live a somewhat functional life at least without this awareness of actor and observer. And so what you're really talking about is a deliberate intervention to understand and resolve that gap in the algorithm. Do I have that right? SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm more or less restating what you said in a way that, I'm hoping, will serve as a jumping off point. Why questions are always very dangerous in biology, or any. SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What's that? SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or in relationship. Right. Exactly. Although, I think it all does really hearken back to this early developmental wiring which, of course, is modifiable. That's the beauty of the nervous system is, it's the one organ that seems to be able to change itself at least to some degree. So what are your thoughts about the organization of the circuitry to essentially under normal conditions to not reveal what seems to be one of its more important and profound and, for dare I say, enlightening features. It's almost as if we are potentially like mantis shrimp. We can see so many more colors than we actually see. And yet, we don't. Most people opt not to. And I would argue that one of the great strengths of the Waking Up app, for instance, is that it essentially walks you through the process of being able to arrive at these things without having to go to one-year or three-year long silent meditation retreats. So if you could just elaborate for a moment before we move on. What are your thoughts about how the circuitry is arranged by default versus-- and what that means for there to be an intervention, that we have to intervene in the self in order to reveal the self. SAM HARRIS: Well, so there are two big questions there, one about evolution and one about development. So with respect to evolution, it's important to recognize that evolution doesn't see our deepest concerns about human flourishing and human well-being. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's all about the offspring. SAM HARRIS: We are set up to spawn and to survive long enough to help our progeny spawn if we can do that. And that's it. And so anything that was good for that, including tribalism and xenophobia and all kinds of hardware and software flaws that revealed themselves to be flaws in the present time, when we're trying to build a viable global civilization. But they redounded to the advantage of our ancestors somehow, or there are things about us that were simply not selected for, they just came along for the ride, what Stephen Jay Gould called a spandrel. So we are not set up by evolution to be as happy as we possibly can be and to do almost anything that interests us well. I mean, we're not set up by evolution to be mathematicians or musicians or to create democracies that are healthy. I mean, evolution can see none of this. And we are doing these things based on cognitive and emotional hardware that we are leveraging in new directions. I mean, we are primates. And we're communicating with small mouth noises. I mean, we're language-using primates. And all of that is clearly evolved. And we're doing these amazing things, including science. However improbably, where we're actually able to, almost entirely with language, understand reality that at a scale that exceeds us in both directions, I mean, the very vast and the very small, and also temporally, the very old. We have visions of the far future. We can figure out where an asteroid is going to cross Earth's orbit 1,000 years from now if we just do the math. And it's amazing that we can do all of those things, but evolution is blind to all of that. And so in terms of what we care about and certainly in terms of what's going to ensure our survival as a species, we have flown the perch that was created for us by evolution. I mean, it's not just the primate things. And so it is with learning how to regulate our emotions and punch through to a self concept or beyond a self concept that is more normative, psychologically, that allows us to not be terrorized by our ape-ish genes as fully as we seem to be, even in the presence of more and more destructive technology. I mean, we're still practically chimpanzees armed with nuclear weapons. And that is increasingly dysfunctional. And very soon we're going to be in the presence of minds, or apparent minds, that we have built that are as intelligent as we are and very quickly, probably 15 minutes after that, far more intelligent than we are. And so what we do with all of that is, again, something that we have to figure out based on the minds we have, the minds we can build, the minds we can change. We can meddle with our own genomes now. And that will produce its own consequences in ourselves and in future generations if we meddle with the germline. And again, all of that is just evolution. It's just sort of the womb we came out of, but it didn't anticipate any of that. Mother nature simply not had our best interests at heart. And we might die off, and from the point of view of mother nature that's fine because 99% of every species dies off. So there's that. But when you're talking about the individual, developmentally-- we all come into this world, again, as a fairly hairless primate that needs a tremendous amount of care by others. And the logic of that is that the reason why we're not a gazelle that can run 45 minutes later and then, basically, do all the gazelle things perfectly soon thereafter. The reason why we have this time of immaturity, and has become functional for us, is that we're far more flexible, and we can learn based on the needs of an environment to do so much more than a gazelle can. And language is part of that. And in the last 10,000 years or so, culture increasingly has been more and more a part of that. And there's probably a layer at which we can plausibly talk about cultural evolution and cultural evolution interacting with biological evolution to change us. But when you're talking about the development of an individual, each of us comes into this world, I think, not recognizing ourselves in any sense that would make sense to reify. I mean, it's not that there's nothing there. I mean, there could be some kind of proto-self differentiation. But I think it takes a long while. And there is very likely a coincidence between really recognizing others. We recognize others first. certainly in relationship immediately. And we orient to human faces. And we even detect other humans as good and bad moral actors very early, I mean, certainly long before we recognize ourselves in a mirror. The experiments run, again, this is Paul Blume and colleagues, experiments run on the moral hardware and software of developing toddlers. But I think at this point, they've pushed it down all the way to six months of age, where you'll get these infants staring at a puppet show. And they'll show a greater interest in classically good actors versus bad actors, cooperators versus defectors, in various puppet show games. So it's not that we have no mind and no proto-awareness of others and of self, but what eventually happens, certainly as we become at all facile with language use, is that we become aware that not only are we in relationship to others, but we are an object in the world for them. So we have enough people pointing at us in our cribs and impinging upon our experience. You're being physically moved, and prodded, and touched, and consoled, or not consoled. And just imagine what all of these-- you're on the receiving end of 10,000 interventions. And you're completely helpless for the longest time. And all of that attention, you have all of these people coming up to the crib and making faces at you-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Cheering for you. SAM HARRIS: And it's all pointed at you. There's a classic magical narcissism that gets constructed there if you take the psychological literature, at least a certain strand of it, seriously. And I think it's largely apt to think of a child at that age as a kind of-- there is a kind of narcissistic structure there, where it's all kind of going inward. And at a certain point you realize, OK, I'm the center of all of this. It's not just a movie where you're completely absorbed in, and you've lost your sense of self. I mean, to talk to yet another example of what it's like as a grown up to lose our sense of self. And one of the things I think we find so fascinating about television and film is that when we get totally absorbed in it, we're in this very unusual circumstance where our brain is basically reading it as we're in the classic social circumstance. We're presented with the facial displays of other people. In fact, sometimes these people are 10 feet tall or their faces are 10 feet tall. You have a close-up in a movie theater. So it's like a super stimulus, in terms of evolution. And they can be making direct eye contact with a camera, so you have this gigantic face staring at you. And yet, you're totally uncomplicated socially. You can't be seen. And something you know you can't be seen. And so you completely lose self consciousness. And yet, you're able to examine with completely free attention, again, because you're totally unimplicated, the facial minutia and the mimetic facial play of people at a very close range. I mean, you have physically just about to kiss your spouse, like that's what a close-up is in a film. You never get that close to people. And yet, here you're in a situation where you're unobserved. And you know that. And so I mean, this is a bit of a tangent, but it's the other side of what's happening developmentally for a kid. When you're in a movie theater watching a movie, you are truly invisible. And yet, you're right there. However harrowing the human drama is, you're seeing it play out. And you're seeing it up close. And it is, in principle, a social encounter that your genes are ready for, but they're not ready for you to be invisible. And so that's what's so magical about it. But what happens developmentally for a kid is that you're not invisible, you are an object that is constantly being overrun, the boundaries of your sensory engagement with the world are constantly being impinged upon by others. And at a certain point, you recognize, OK, I'm at the center of this. And the way this gets enshrined as a self, I think is probably coincident with our learning the language game we learn to play with others. We're talking to others. People are talking to us. And at a certain point, we're talking to ourselves, even when the other people leave the room. And you can hear it. If you ever have been with a toddler when they're externalizing their self-talk, you hear them talking to themselves. They're playing. And they're having a conversation. They were talking to you, the parent. But then you left the room, and they're still talking. You come back in, and they're still talking. And what happens to us, strangely, and this comes back to the logic of evolution, we never stop because evolution never thought to build us an off-switch for this. I mean, language is so useful. And it gets tuned up so strongly for us. And there was never a reason to shut it off. There was never a reason to give you this ability to say, oh, wouldn't it be nice to have four hours of quiet now, like no self-talk. And so for most of us, I mean, I think there are people who, for whatever neurological reason or idiosyncratic reason, undoubtedly there'd be a neurological reason for it, don't have any self-talk. But for most of us, we are covertly talking basically all the time. And there's an imagistic component of this for many people. You're visualizing things as well. But there's just a ton of white noise in the mind that feels a certain way. And what you discover in meditation, ultimately, is that the self is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking. A thought arises uninspected and seems to just become you. Like you and I are talking now. And people are listening to us. They're struggling to follow the train of this conversation because it is competing with the conversation that's happening in their heads. So I'll be saying something. And a person listening will say, well, what does that mean? Or like, oh, but wait a minute, he just contradicted himself. And there's a voice in your head that is also vying for your attention much of the time. So the first discovery people make in meditation is that it's just so hard to pay attention to anything, the breath, or a mantra, or a sound, whatever it is, because you're thinking. You're thinking about the thing you need to do in an hour. And oh, it's so good that I downloaded this app. This is really good. This is going to be good for me. But that chatter isn't showing up. You're not far back enough in the theater of consciousness, so as to see it emerge. It is just sneaking up behind you. And it feels like me again. It feels like when someone is thinking the thought, well, what the hell does that mean? They're not seeing it as an emerging object in consciousness. It just feels like me. Subjectively, is like the mind contracts around this appearance in consciousness. And it really is just a sound with the voice of the mind. If you actually can inspect it, it is deeply inscrutable that we ever feel identified with our thoughts. I mean, how is it that we could be a thought? A thought just arises and passes away. And when you inspect it, when you go to inspect it, it unravels. It's the least substantial possible thing. But yet, it could be a thought of self-hatred. It could be a thought, that unrecognized, totally defines your mood. I mean, again, this all can seem kind of abstract. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, no, but I think it's extremely concrete from the perspective of the neural circuits that will return to maybe in a few minutes. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help me better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there. however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. Inside Tracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions, you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. If you could elaborate a bit on this notion of internal chatter and external stimuli and the bridge between them because I think for some people that might be intuitive. I think for others, it's not so obvious that language is ongoing in the backdrop. And then sometimes, I think some people are more tuned into that language. For some people, it's louder volume. For some people, it's more structured. I have a colleague at Stanford who's been on this podcast called Deisseroth. He's one of, like, the preeminent bioengineers. He's also a psychiatrist. And he has a-- he doesn't call it a meditative practice, but he has a practice where each evening, after his five kids are put down to sleep, you know-- they're older now-- and in the quiet of the late hours of the night, early morning, he sits and forces himself to think in complete sentences, with punctuation, for an hour. This is the way that he has taught himself to structure his thinking, because of the very fact that you're describing, which is that ordinarily, there is an underlying structure to what's internal, but it's disrupted by external events, And these are-- typically, it's not coherent enough to really make meaning from. So it's almost like somebody sitting down to write in complete sentences, but forcing himself to do it in his head. But for many people, including myself, that's a foreign experience. And we only experience structure through our interactions with the world and other people. I've taken the time to try and explore ideas with eyes closed. And I've been able to do that. There are certain pharmacologic states that we could talk about that facilitate that. And no, those are not amphetamines. Those do exactly the opposite, by the way. But I think people exist in varying degrees of structured and unstructured internal dialogue, and in varying depths of recognition of that internal dialogue. And so the question, I suppose, is, just the recognition that there's a dialogue ongoing, internally-- is that, itself, valuable? SAM HARRIS: Yeah. And that also can take some time. So, I mean, here's a claim I would make that some people might find surprising. But I think this is an objectively true claim about the subjectivity of most people, which is that unless you have a fair amount of training-- let's say you just happen to be some kind of savant in this area, which most people, by definition, aren't, or you have a remarkable amount of training in what's called concentration practice in meditation-- I believe this is a true claim-- that if we just put a stopwatch on this table, and people could just watch it 30 seconds elapse, and I set all of our listeners, or your viewers, the task, for the next 30 seconds, just pay attention to anything-- your breath, you know, or the sight of your hand, or the sight of the clock, or any object-- without getting lost in thought, without getting momentarily distracted by this conversation you're having with yourself. A couple of things would happen. One is no one would be able to do it, right? And this is not just a superficial inability. I mean, if your life depended on it, you wouldn't be able to do it. I mean, if the fate of civilization depended on it, none of our listeners would be able to do this. And yet, some percentage of them are so distracted by thought that they will actually try this experiment and think they succeeded. Right? And for these people, what happens is you put them on a meditation retreat, and you have them spend 12 hours a day in silence, doing nothing but this. Right? So the practice is just pay attention to the breath when they're sitting, and then eventually, you incorporate everything-- sounds and other sensations. And then you interleave that with walking meditation, where they're paying attention just to the sensations of lifting and moving and placing their feet. And then once the practice is going, you incorporate sounds and sights and everything. So you can pay attention to everything, but the goal is, for every moment, you are going to cultivate this faculty of mind, which increasingly is known as mindfulness. Right? And mindfulness is nothing other than this very careful attention to the contents of consciousness. But the crucial piece is it is not a moment of being lost in thought. Right? You're not blocking thoughts. Thoughts themselves can arise. But in those moments of being truly mindful, you're noticing thoughts as thoughts. Whether it's language in the mind or images, you're noticing those, too, as spontaneous appearances in consciousness. So if most people-- you know, certainly anyone who thinks they can pay attention to-- who can do the experiment successfully that I just suggested-- pay attention to something for 30 seconds without being lost in thought-- you put those people on a meditation retreat, what they're going to experience is, you know, on the first day, they're going to feel, like, oh, yeah. I was with the breath, or I was walking-- you know, I was with the sensations of walking-- and I'd be there for, like, five minutes solid, and then I would get lost in thought. And then I'd come back. And then five more minutes, I'd be lost in thought, and then get back. But as the days progressed-- even, you know, 10 days in to a silent meditation retreat-- they're going to experience more and more distraction. It's going to seem like, OK, wait a minute. Now I can't pay attention to anything for more than 5 seconds. Right? That is progress, right? Because what they're discovering is just how distractible they are. Right? And you know, for some people, that will be immediately obvious. For some people, it'll actually take a lot of practice to realize just how distracted they are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What you just said, which was that, at some point, we can start noticing our thoughts-- I can notice my thoughts-- but what you're talking about, as a goal state, is not being distracted by thoughts, but actually seeing the relationship between thoughts, self, and other types of perceptions. And here, I think recognizing and seeing thoughts is a form of perception. It's just an internally-directed perception. This raises a topic that I'm also obsessed by, which I think neuroscience can somewhat explain, but still incompletely-- that the circuits and mechanics, et cetera, are not yet known-- which is about time perception. And you know, a simple analogy would be that there are a lot of small objects flying around in the space that we happen to be having this discussion, but they're moving so fast that I can't perceive them. Or they're entirely stationary, so I can't perceive them because of the reasons we talked about before in the visual system. My eyes are moving in perfect concert with these small object movements, and therefore, I am blind to them. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A slight shift in time perception-- think of this, perhaps, as a change in the frame rate, right? Camera frame rates. A faster frame rate, you can capture slow motion. Slower frame rate, you're going to get more of a strobe-type effect if the frame rate is low enough. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right? Could it be that our time perception is not one thing, but we have one rate of perceiving time for external objects at a given distance-- which we know is true-- another frame rate for objects that are up close-- we know this to be true, even if those objects are moving at the exact same speed, right? I mean, this would be the sitting on a train, the rungs on the fence seem to be going by very, very fast, but the ones in the distance seem to be moving slowly. This is the way the visual system and time perception interconnect at some level. You're up on a skyscraper-- the little ants of cars and people down below. You know they're moving much faster than you perceive them to move, but it's a distance effect. SAM HARRIS: I mean, you see a plane, it's going to be going 300 miles an hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's not because of the lack of resolution. The lack of resolution is incidental. We know this because in animals, such as hawks, that have twice the degree of acuity, as far as we know, they have the same distance-associated shifts in time perception. So could it be that we are running multiple streams of time perception, multiple cones of attention, that include cones of attention to our thoughts, and that somehow, through meditation, we start to align the frame rate for these different streams of attention so that they all fall into the same movie, if you will-- although it's not just a movie with visual content. What I'm doing here is clearly, I'm becoming a lumper rather than a spreader. I'm sure this violates certain rules of time perception and neural circuitry, but I'm not sure that it's entirely untrue, either. And does it survive at all, as a possible model for what you're describing? And if the answer is no, I'm perfectly comfortable with that. SAM HARRIS: Well, it's dependent on what you mean by meditation. This is where, sort of, the particularities of what one is doing with one's attention under the frame of meditation really matter, because there are ways to practice mindfulness, in particular, where the frame rate really does seem to go way, way up. Right? And there's actually been some research done on this, where you take people before and after a three-month silent meditation retreat, and you give them some kind of visual discrimination task where they have to detect-- I think they used a tachistoscope. Is that the tool for? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not familiar. SAM HARRIS: Something that presents, you know, very quick pulses of light. And in any case, just in any sensory channel, I would imagine you can make finer-grained discriminations if you're practicing mindfulness in a very specific way, which is to be making these fine-grained discriminations more and more, and do nothing else for three months, which is a way of practicing. So the classic mindfulness practice in what's called Vipassana meditation is to pay scrupulous attention to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching in a way that breaks everything down into these kind of microscopic sensory moments. So you know, rather than feel your hands pressing together, what you're trying to feel with your attention and you're feeling more and more is all of the sensations of pressure and temperature and movement such that the feeling of hands completely disappears. You realize that a hand is a concept, and all you have is this cloud of punctate and very brief sensations. And so anything you think you have as a datum of experience, as you bore into it with your attention, it resolves into this kind of diaphanous cloud of changing sensation. And that can be even something as captivating as, like, a serious pain in your body. I mean, you can have could have injured your neck, you know? And so you have some excruciating pain in your neck. If you just are willing to pay attention to it, you know, and just pay 100% attention to it, a couple of things happen. One is your resistance to feeling it goes away, by definition, because now your goal is to just pay attention to it. And you recognize that so much of the suffering associated with the pain was borne of the resistance to feeling it. You're bracing against it and all of your thinking about it, you know? You're thinking, like, well, you know, why did I do this to myself, or should I see an orthopedist, or how long is this going to last? And maybe I herniated a disk. Like, all of that self-talk is producing anxiety. And I'm not saying there's never anything to think about there. But either you can do something about it in the moment or you can't. And so much of our suffering in the presence of pain is the result of resisting it, worrying about it, thinking-- just all of the-- everything we're doing with our minds, but just feeling it, right? So when you just feel it, again, it breaks apart into this ever shifting collection of different sensations. And it's not one thing, and it never stays the same. So two things happen there. One is there can be a tremendous amount of relief that happens there where you can achieve a level of equanimity, even in the presence of really unpleasant physical sensation. And this is true of mental sensation as well. As it's true of emotions. The classically negative emotions like anger, depression, or fear. The moment you become willing to just feel them in all of their punctate and changeable qualities, they cease to be what they were a moment ago. When you're talking about emotional states, they cease to map back on to you and your self concept as meaningful in the same way. So that suddenly, the anxiety you feel, let's say, before going out on stage to give a talk, a moment ago, it had psychological meaning, it felt like, I'm anxious. How do I get rid of this? Why am I this sort of person? Should I have taken a beta blocker? This is the conversation you're having with yourself. The moment you just become willing to feel it as the pure energy of the physiology of cortisol release, it ceases to have any meaning. It ceases to be a problem in that moment, because it's no more-- it no more maps onto the kind of person you are then a feeling of indigestion or a pain in your knee maps onto the kind of person you are. It's just sensation, anyway. Back to the main point here, which is that, if you train your attention in this way to notice the particularities of sensory experience and emotional experience, you're looking for the atoms of experience. You get better and better at that and certain things happen. But one thing that I really do think happens is there's a kind of frame rate change in the data stream where you really are just-- you're just noticing much, much more. All of that is a very interesting way of training. It's not what I tend to recommend now. It's a great preliminary practice for what I do recommend, because it really teaches you the difference between being lost in thought and not, it really teaches you what mindfulness is. But it tends to be done by 99.9% of people in a dualistic way, which, again, you're set up to think, OK, I'm over here as the locus of attention. And I'm continually getting distracted by thought. And the project is to not do that anymore and actually pay attention to the breath and sounds and sensations. And every time I get lost in thought, I'm going to go back here. But this whole dance of I'm lost in thought, now I'm strategically directing my attention again, all of this seems to ramify this sense of self. The of there's one to be doing this. There's somebody holding the spotlight of attention and getting better at coming back to the object of meditation. Again, it's inevitable that 99.9% of people are going to start there and stay there for some considerable period of time. But the thing I like to do when I talk about all of this is undercut the false assumptions that are anchoring all of that as early as possible, because where, I think, you want to be is recognizing that there is no place from which to aim attention. This whole dualistic setup of subject and object is the thing that is already not there. And it's not that it's there and you meditate it out of existence successfully. It's really not there. And if you learn how to look for it, you can see that it's not there and feel that it's not there. And it no longer seems to be there. It's like it's not-- and it becomes like, again, like a bi-stable percept where you looked at it long enough and you thought, OK, now I see the vase and the face and I can't unsee it. And every time I look, it's there again, right? So yeah. So to come back to the example you gave with your colleague at Stanford whose book I know I have. I haven't read it. This is a-- he wrote a book, Projections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. SAM HARRIS: So it's on my stack to read. But it's the opposite-- what I'm recommending is, essentially, the opposite end of the continuum of the internal exercise he was doing. So rather than-- so he's doing something very deliberate and controlled, and he is deliberately thinking in complete sentences and commandeering the machinery of thought and attention in a way that I would imagine. I mean, I'd be interested to talk to him about it. But I would imagine, he really feels like he's doing that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an engineer-- as you've describe it in this way, it reminds me, he's a physician, but he's also an engineer. So it's really about taking the raw materials of thought and engineering something structured from it. SAM HARRIS: Right. Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I haven't been in Carl's mind. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. But if we got him talking on that, I'm sure we would get a sense of what it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We'll do that conversation at some point. It's the exact opposite of what you're describing. SAM HARRIS: Exact opposite would be to recognize that the sense of control is a total illusion. Because you don't know what you're going to think next. And even he, in the most laborious way, I mean, he could just get as muscular as he wants with it. He still doesn't know what he's going to think next. Because thoughts simply arise. You can run this experiment for yourself. And this connects up to the topic of free will which we might want to touch. But I mean, just think of any category of thing. If I asked you to think of the names of cities or of friends you have or of famous people you can remember exist or think of nouns or anything. And just watch what comes percolating into consciousness right now. There are things you can't think of, there are things you don't know the name of. There are languages you don't speak, there are famous people you've never seen or never heard of. So you have no control over that part. Like those names and faces are not going to suddenly come streaming into consciousness. But the totality of facts and figures and faces and names that you do know, only some will come vying for inclusion. And there's a sort of-- we could make guess and we know something about the neurology of this. But you depending on what channel you're waiting for thoughts in, I mean, it's going to be different if it's visual or semantic or episodic memory. I mean, all of these things are different. But wherever you point your inner gaze of attention and wait for the next face or name. Certain things are going to come and certain things aren't going to come. And how you land on one-- there'll be this process if you're paying attention, you might think, let's say we go with names of cities, right? So you'll think of Paris, you'll think of London, you'll think of Rome, you'll think of Sedona. So these names will come. And if I ask you to just say one, right? So just-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Minneapolis is what came to mind. For me, it was very straightforward. It was Minneapolis, the famous person was Joe Strummer and they just like-- I can give you reasons why I think those came to mind. Recent conversations. SAM HARRIS: OK. So we know a fair bit about much of this. So one, we know that your reasons, obviously, could be right or wrong. They're very likely to be wrong because we have this confabulatory storytelling mechanism even in an intact brain where we just-- we seem to never lack for the reasons why something came to mind, and we can know we can manipulate people in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong and confident. You know, confidently so about the reasons why they thought of things or did things. But leaving that aside, even if you're completely accurate, there are people's names who you know and cities names that you know that inexplicably just didn't come to mind. And if we ran this experiment again and again and again, they wouldn't come to mind if your brain was in precisely the state it was in a moment ago. If we could return your brain to the state it was in a moment ago, correcting for all the deterministic changes and all the random changes that would have to be corrected for, it to just get-- all the synapses and the synaptic weights and everything in the state it was in to produce Joe Strummer in Minneapolis. If we rewind that movie, that part of the movie of your life, you are going to say Joe Strummer in Minneapolis a trillion times in a row. So this is why, in my view, the notion of free will makes absolutely no sense. And you can add as much randomness to that process as you want. It still doesn't get you the freedom people think they have. There's another conversation to have about why none of that matters and why things only get better once you admit to yourself that free will is an illusion. And yes, you can get in shape and you can diet and you can do all the things you want to do and you don't have to think about free will. But from a contemplative, meditative point of view, the thing to notice is that everything is just springing into view. There's no place from which you are authoring your next thought, because you would have to think it before you think it. Like there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs that is disgorging everything that we experience. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What if I'm speaking? So if I'm talking about something and I have some command of that information, I can often sense what I'm going to say next and then find myself saying it. And hopefully, that's what they say and not something else. I certainly said things I didn't intend to say or never thought I would say in life. But when engaged in speech or action, it at least gives us the illusion, I think, that we somehow have more command over our thoughts. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Well you have a script. I mean, it's like there are things you know a lot about and you've talked about them a lot, and you know you have the things you want to say about those things and the things you don't want to say or you wouldn't want to say. And you know you can-- it still is a bit of a high wire act, because you can misspeak or you can fail to get to the end of a sentence in a grammatically correct way. And again, all of this-- objectively, this whole process is mysterious to you. You don't know how you follow the rules of English grammar. Like your tongue is doing it somehow and when it fails, it fails, and you're just as surprised as the next guy that it failed. And you mispronounce a word, and OK, I don't know what happened there. But if it keeps happening, I'm going to worry I had a stroke. And if it stops, I'm not going to worry about it. So it's still mysterious even when you're doing it in a very rote, deliberative, and repetitive way. But when you're talking about something you've talked about a lot and you know where you're going to go, right? We have many conversations like this, it is somewhat analogous to like a golf swing. Where it's like, you know how you want to do it, it's going to be all kinds of errors that are going to creep into your execution of it in real time. But there's like you, basically, have a pattern. And so you have certain linguistic patterns which you're following. Again, none of this is a proof of free will, but I will grant you that phenomenologically, it feels different than just waiting for the next thought to come. But my point is that, even if you are-- I mean, you can trim it down to the simplest possible thing. Like you take two things you like to drink. You like coffee and you like tea. And you're deciding which to have. Both are on offer. You've got two cups in front of you. And the question is, here I've got water and I've got coffee, which am I going to drink next? Incredibly, it's as simple as possible decision. And no matter how long I make this decision process, I could literally sit for an hour trying to figure out which to reach for next. And I could have my reasons why, and I could have all my self talk. There's going to be a final change in me that's going to be the proximate cause of me deciding one over the other. And that, no matter how laborious I can make it seem in terms of my reasoning about it, it is going to be fundamentally mysterious as to why I went with one rather than the other. Whatever story I have-- because it's like-- it's still going to be as mysterious as you thinking of Joe Strummer when you absolutely-- you know of the existence of Marilyn Monroe just as much. And yet she simply didn't occur to you. It's fundamentally mysterious. Like there are people who are even more famous than Joe Strummer to you. I mean, I'm sure he may be somebody who you have thought a lot about, but there are people who like if we could just inventory your conscious life going back the last 10 years, there are people who you've thought about more than Joe Strummer yet they didn't appear. And that is mysterious. And they could have, but they didn't. What I'm saying is that this mystery never gets banished in our experience. Whatever stories. We have to tell about it. Because if the story is, oh, well, I went for the water because I think I've been drinking too much coffee. I listen to Andrew Huberman's podcast and he was talking about caffeine, and I think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's good for us, but you don't want to overdo it. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. SAM HARRIS: OK. So let's say that is, actually, the causal chain. Like, I listen to your podcast, you say something about caffeine, now I'm self conscious about my coffee intake. But that's just adding a couple of links to the chain. There's still this fundamental mystery of, well, why did I find that persuasive? And why did I find it persuasive now and not five minutes ago when I was drinking the coffee? Like why did I just remember it now, or why was it effective? You only have-- your experience in every moment is precisely what it is and not one bit more. And this subsumes even moments of real resolve and effort and picking yourself up by your bootstraps and changing everything. It's like you're on a diet and you're tempted to eat chocolate. And you think you're about to reach and say, no, I'm not breaking this diet. This diet is actually going to stick. Why did that arise in that moment and not at this analogous moment on your last diet? And why did it arise now to precisely the degree that it did? Why will it be as effective as it will be and have the half-life that it will have and not 10% more or less. All of those are always mysterious to you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, could we give, as we did before, an evolutionary and a developmental explanation? An evolutionary explanation might be that directed attention and action is metabolically demanding. It would be inefficient or impossible for us to be in constant, deliberate action with access to all the relevant information as to why we would do anything. So our ideas, literally, spring to the surface at the last possible moment in order to offset the great metabolic requirements of having ideas that are related to goal-directed action or that goal-directed action is expensive. That's one idea. The other idea would be-- and we know this as a fact, which is that, initially, the brain is fairly crudely wired. That's not true within the neural circuits that control breathing, heart rate, et cetera, but within the neural circuits of sensory perception, thought, et cetera. They're fairly crudely wired. And then across development, there's a progressive pruning back and also in parallel to that, a strengthening of the connections that underlie directed action and thought. And here, I don't mean directed as in free will, I mean, just that I can decide to imagine an apple and imagine that apple, for instance. SAM HARRIS: Right. But your decision-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: There seems to be some maintenance of the fine random wiring in systems. I mean, we've seen this even in worms, in flies, in so-called lower invertebrates and lower vertebrates. And we see this in humans. And it seems to be that there's a lot of background spontaneous activity. I mean, I've sunk electrodes into the brains of humans, macaques, carnivores, and mice. And in every case, most of what you hear is called hash and it has nothing to do with hashish. Is just [VOCALIZING] on the audio monitor which is picking up a bunch of action potentials. As you're listening to a chorus of action potentials. But it's rare to find a neuron that faithfully [VOCALIZING] fires to represent some sensory stimulus in the world. And you can arrange that marriage experimentally so that you can arrive at those strong signal to noise events. But I was always struck by how much noise there is in the system all around all the time. And people argue, is the noise really noise, et cetera? There's still a lot of debate about that. But I can imagine that some of the spontaneous nature of thoughts just relates to the fact that there's a lot of background spontaneous activity in the brain. Now, why that is a whole other discussion. But if I were to set up two constraints that there's a lot of spontaneous activity, it's going to generate random thoughts. Thankfully, not much random action, although there's a little bit of random action in our daily lives. And then against that say, well, any deliberate thought or motion is going to be expensive. It's a metabolically expensive organ to begin with. And so you just have to-- evolution has arrived at a place where spontaneous geysering up of things upon which like deliberate thoughts and action are superimposed is the best arrangement overall for this very metabolically demanding organ. I mean, what I basically gave was just kind of a biological description of just one narrow aspect of it. But can we get comfortable with that? And the reason I say get comfortable is that I'm-- and here, admittedly, I'm forcing a little bit of a striptease towards what I think I and everyone else wants to know, which is how to meditate and why, in particular, meditation convinces us that something doesn't necessarily have to be eliminated, but that was actually never there. I feel like we've now set up a sort of almost like a-- you're not contradicting yourself by any means, but in my mind, there's a contradiction. And here's the contradiction. I love this statement that meditation over time or done properly reveals to us that we're actually not trying to make the gap between actor and observer go away. It was actually never there. To me, that's one of the more important statements that I, perhaps, have ever heard. And it inspires me to go further down this path of meditation, because I've never experienced that. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not deliberately, and certainly, not through meditation. If I ever experienced it, it was transient enough that I'm intrigued to experience it more. So on the one hand, you're telling me something was never there. And there's a profound experience to be heard by anyone that's willing to do the work to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion. On the other hand, I'm hearing that there's a profound gap that really does exist, which is that we believe that our thoughts are somehow from us. And indeed, they're from in the cranial vault someplace, maybe, in the body a bit as well. But that we over attribute the degree to which we are that and that is us in a way that's volitional, that we control. And so once I'm hearing that there's something-- there's an illusion that we can eliminate and on the other hand I'm hearing that there's an illusion that we can't eliminate, and maybe these are unrelated and I'm bridging them in an unimportant way, that seems only important to me. But somehow, I can't resolve these two and maybe the thing to do then is, can we separate them in terms of a practice to witness them? That would allow us to resolve them separately. SAM HARRIS: Right. So I think I'm hearing the problem. There's this-- let me bracket the whole free will discussion because it really is the flip side of this coin that I'm-- the obverse of which is the illusion of the self. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So at least-- I might be on the right track. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They are the opposite sides of a coin. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Great. Because to me they seem very different in essence. SAM HARRIS: No. Because what I'm calling the sense of self and what I think most people feel as their core sense of self is this feeling of-- I mean, it's the feeling of being the locus of attention, but it's also the feeling of being the locus of agency. I can do the next thing. Like, who's doing this? Who's reaching for the cup? I am. Right? I intended this, and now I'm doing the thing. And my conscious intention is the proximate cause of my reaching, right? And so I'm the author of my thoughts and actions, essentially. And my specific uses of attention, right? So I can pay attention to the breath, I get lost in thought, I come back to the breath. But on some level, the thoughts themselves are more of my doing something with almost authorial intent. Like I'm thinking like, what the hell is this guy talking about? Who's thinking these thoughts? I am. The person who really doesn't get what I'm saying is thinking something like that. What the fuck is this guy talking about? I know I'm here. I'm a self, I'm a body, I'm a mind. I can reach for things. That these intentional actions are different from things that happen to me. A voluntary action is different from an involuntary one. So having a tremor is different from consciously deciding to pick up a glass. So obviously, everything I'm saying about meditation and the self and free will in order to be a sane picture of a human mind and of reality has to conserve the data of experience such that, yes, I can acknowledge the difference between a tremor and a deliberative voluntary motor action. And the things you do volitionally are different not just psychologically and behaviorally, but they just have different implications for like in a court of law. You accidentally hit someone with your car or you did it on purpose, that's still a distinction that matters. Importantly, it tells us a lot about the global properties of your mind such that we have a sense of what you're likely to do in the future. If you're someone who likes running over people with your car, you're a psychopath who we need to worry about. If you're is someone who did it by accident, well then you may be culpable for the level of negligence that allow that to happen. But you're a very different person and we you differently and we're wise to. So anyway, we can bracket all of that. There's this-- I mean, there are some fundamental-- there are some false assumptions about the underlying logic of this process, which, I think, is worth addressing. Is actually-- there was a kind of found object in the news that I talk about at one point. I forget where it is in Waking Up app. But there was a story that I stumbled on the internet. I think it's about 12 or 13 years old. Of a tourist bus in-- I think it was in Norway. It was somewhere in Northern Europe. And it had about 30 people on it. And one person was described as an Asian woman. And they went to a rest stop and everyone got off the bus. And shopped and had lunch. And this Asian woman changed her clothing for whatever reason. And they all got back on the bus. I think the relevance of it being an Asian woman is that there were language barriers that explain what later happened. So everyone gets back on the bus, the Asian woman has changed her clothing. And the bus is about to leave but then someone notices, hey, there was an Asian woman who got off the bus who isn't-- it hasn't come back yet. And they tell the driver this. And this poses a problem. So now everyone's waiting for this person to return. But in fact, everyone was on the bus. This woman had just changed her clothing, and was not recognized by her fellow travelers. So everyone gets concerned as this tourist doesn't show up. And they start looking for her. And they can't find her. And so a search party is formed. And the Asian woman, because of whatever language barrier, heard that there was a missing tourist, so she joins the search party, which, in fact, is looking for her. And this goes on into the night. And they're readying helicopters for a dawn patrol to find the missing tourist. Now, at some point along the way, I think it was at like 3:00 in the morning, this tourist realizes that she is the object of this search. And obviously, the whole thing unravels. She confesses that she changed her clothes and the problem is solved. But the problem is not solved by the logic that the seeker is expected. So it's like, it's not true to say that the missing tourist was found in the way that was expected. Because a missing tourist was never lost. The missing tourist was part of the search party. So when you think about it from her point of view, like what happened, she's part of the search party. She's looking for the missing tourist not knowing that she, in fact, is the missing tourist. So what happens at the moment she realizes that everyone's looking for her? The search isn't consummated in the way that is implied by the logic of everyone's use of attention. And yet the problem evaporates. And there's something deeply analogous about the structure of that and the meditative journey. Precisely in, again, not talking about all the possible changes in the contents of consciousness that could be good, which, again, they come along for the ride anyway when you do the thing I'm talking about. It's on this point of looking for the self and not finding it. And there is this sense that, OK, the self is here, and it's a problem. It is the string upon which all of my conscious states, mostly unhappy ones, are strong. It's the thing that is at the center of my anxiety. It's the thing that I don't feel good about. It's the thing that when criticized, I let implode. It's the center of my problem, and now I'm trying to feel better. And meditation has been handed to me as a possible remedy for my situation. And it's billed as a remedy. And in fact, I'm hearing from this guy that this is the thing that is going to cause me to realize that my self isn't where-- or as I thought it was. So now I'm going to look. And so again, the sense is, I start out far away from the goal here. I start out with a problem. I'm now meditating on the evidence of my enlightenment. I can feel my problem. I feel that I'm distracted and distractible. And I feel as this sort of cramp at the center of my life, that's me. And I'm not as happy as I want to be, I'm not as confident as I want to be. I'm more distractible than I want to be. And now, I'm paying attention to the breath. This is what the search party feels like. This is what the confused tourist feels like in her own search party. And she's looking for the missing person. So the angle of-- the inclination of all of this is-- and the logic of it is all wrong, understandably so, given how we all get into this situation. But it's useful to continually try to undercut it and recognize that the thing that's being looked for is actually right on the surface, which is, there is no one looking. There is no place from which you are-- if you're paying attention to the breath or to sounds or noticing the next thought arise, this sense that you are over here doing that thing is actually what it's like to be thinking and not knowing that you're thinking. There's an undercurrent of thought that's going uninspected in that moment. And so there is just-- there's a continually looking for the mind, looking for the center of experience, looking for the one who is looking, which, again, which is the orienting practice here. And there's a lot more I say about this, obviously, over waking up. But it's the experiment you have to perform in order to get ready to recognize that the search party was formed in error, essentially. And the problem that you're trying to solve with this practice does evaporate in a similar way, which is like, you don't actually get there in the way that you're hoping for. It's like you drop out the bottom of this thing in an unexpected way. There's actually another similar parable or anecdote that I don't remember if it's Zen or Sufi or-- I mean, I'm sure it's been re-appropriated in many different ways or by many different traditions. But the case of somebody who's lost in a town and they're asking for directions and you can put this in Manhattan. Let's say, you're wandering Manhattan and you're a tourist, you don't know where anything is. And you stop and ask someone, where is Central Park? And the person thinks for a second and they says, oh, yeah. Unfortunately, you can't get to Central Park from here. Now, that is a very strange-- I mean, you think about that for a second. You realize, OK, that's an absurd. There is no place that you can't get to from the place you're starting on Earth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A failure to describe the physical relationships between anything in the world. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. That's just not the world we live in. So but it's a funny thing. But on some level that is true of meditation. It's like you can't get there from here. The sense of view as subject isn't brought along to this thing you're looking for. It's almost like you're making a fist and you're trying to get to an open hand. The fist doesn't get to take that journey as a fist. The fist doesn't go along for the ride. The fist comes apart. And on some level, the subjectivity is an attentional fist. It is a contraction of energy. Again, it's so much bound up and thought for most of us, most of the time. And when properly inspected, there's just this evaporation of the starting point. But there's not this fulfillment of, I'm going to get-- this fixed is just going to-- if life gets good enough, if I get concentrated enough, focused enough, if I austere enough, if I renounce enough, if I desire less, if I-- with enough good intentions, this fist is going to move into some sort of sublime condition. That's not the logic of the process. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I really appreciate these models and analogies for conscious experience both as most people experience them and harbor them and as a way to frame what's possible through a proper meditation practice. I do want to talk about what a proper meditation practice looks like a bit. But at some point, I do want to raise a model of, maybe, even just perceptual awareness to see if it survives the filters that you've provided. But first, briefly, and then we can return to it. What does this meditation practice or set of practices look like? Obviously, the app is a wonderful tool. I've started using it. As I mentioned at the beginning, my father's been using it for a while and many people have derived great benefit from it. But if we were to break it down, meditation into some basic component parts as we have broken down normal perceptual experience in some of its component parts-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I can just throw out some things that I associate with meditation, and maybe you can elaborate on how these may or may not be applied. For instance, there is almost always a ceasing of robust motor movement. I know they're walking meditations and so forth. But it seems like sitting or lying down and, perhaps, not always but often limiting our visual perception, closing the eyes. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Directing a mind's eye someplace. Is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery? What are the component parts? And where I'm really going with this is, why would those component parts, eventually, allow for this dissolution of the fist or the realization that there is no distinction between actor and observer and so on. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Well, so to answer the second question first, ultimately, meditation is not a practice that you're adding to your life. It's not a doing more of anything. It's actually ceasing to do something. It's ultimately non-distraction. I mean, ultimately, you're recognizing what consciousness is like when you're no longer distracted by the automatic arising of thought. It's not the thoughts don't arise, it's not that you can't use them, it's not that you become irrational or unintelligent, I mean, all of that-- you still have all of your tools, but everything is in plain view. I mean, there's an analogy in Tibetan Buddhism which I love, which is you're kind of in the final stage of meditation, thoughts are like thieves entering an empty house. There's nothing for them to steal. So in the usual case, thoughts are-- there really is something in jeopardy. Every time a thought comes, I'm not meditating anymore, and not only that, I feel terrible because of what I'm thinking about most of the time. And so it's totally understandable that thoughts seem like a problem in the beginning. And for certain types of meditation, they are explicitly thought of as a problem because you're trying to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else, including thought. And that is what I called the concentration practice earlier. And that's a training that can be good to do. It becomes a tool that you can use for other kinds of insight. But it's a very specific and it's kind of brittle skill in the end. I mean, it's a skill. Just like I'm going to pay attention to one thing and I'm going to do that so well that everything else is going to fade out. And it's somewhat analogous to what you described in the visual system. If have a laser focus to one fixation point, everything else in your visual field begins to fade out. But meditatively, if you have a laser focus on any one thing, whether it's the breath or a candle flame or whatever it is, not only does-- I mean, let's use the breath for a second. Because your eyes can be closed. I mean, you can lose all sense of everything. I mean, you can lose all sense of hearing and your physical body can disappear. I mean, like, literally, it can become incredibly subtle and vast and drug-like. And many people approach meditation thinking climbing the ladder of those changes into subtlety and vastness, that's the whole game. And it can be a deeply rewarding game to play. And it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits. I mean, all the focus and the calm and the smoothness of emotional states. I mean, all of that comes with greater concentration. And it can be quite wonderful. But again, at best, that's a tool to aim in the direction that I'm talking about now with respect to meditation, which relates to more what I would call mindfulness generically. And ultimately, non-dual mindfulness. So mindfulness generically and for most people, certainly in the beginning, dualistically is just the practice of paying careful attention to whatever is arising on its own. Now in the beginning, it's natural to take a single object like the breath as a starting point. It's an anchor. But very, very quickly, over the course of even your first week of doing this, teachers and various sources of information will recommend that once you get some facilities-- once you know the difference between being lost in thought and actually paying attention to the breath, well, then you can open it up to everything. You can open up the sounds and other sensations in the body and moods and emotions. And even, ultimately, thoughts themselves. So very quickly, you can recognize that thoughts are not intrinsically the enemy to this practice. They are also just spontaneous appearances in consciousness that can be observed. But for some considerable period of time, people will feel that there is a place from which that observation is happening. There's just, I'm now the one who's being mindful. And however attenuated that sense of self can be, I mean, again, it can get very expansive. I mean, you can lose-- as you get anything, just a modicum of concentration, you know it becomes very drug-like and you get the boundaries of your body dissolve. And your feeling of having a body can disappear. And you if your eyes are closed, you know your visual field-- I mean, most people, when they close their eyes initially, they just forget about their visual field. But if you close your eyes right now, you notice your visual field is fully present. And we call it dark, but it's not quite dark. There is a sort of scintillating some field of color and shadow that's there in the darkness of your closed eyes. And that can become a sky-like domain of vast visual expression that opens up as you get more concentrated with your eyes closed right. So you can very much be aware of seeing with your eyes closed in a meditative practice. But from the point of view of mindfulness, the logic is not to care about any of the interesting changes and experience that come as a result of practicing in this way, because the underlying goal is to be more and more equanimous with changes. So it's not to grasp at what's pleasant or interesting and not to push what's unpleasant or boring or otherwise not engaging in a way. What you want is just a kind of a sky-like mind that just allows everything to appear. And you're not clinging to anything or reacting to anything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask you what your thoughts are about the differences between nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the context of what we're talking about in you're describing? And the reason I bring this up is that as you know, I know everything in biology is a process. We would never ever say, oh, the perception of that red line on a painting is a noun. I mean, it's an event in the visual system. You're abstracting some understanding about that thing in the outside world. And I think it's very useful in thinking about the brain. People will notice I notice-- I, excuse me, actively avoid the use of the word mind, because I figure, especially, with sitting across from me, that I'll step in it if I do. But the brain generates a series of perceptions or what have you by through processes, not nouns. And so when thinking about biology, I think of development is an arc of processes. Aging is an arc-- perception is an arc of processes. They just exist on different time scales. And so a little bit of what I'm hearing is that inside of an effective meditation practice, there's a little bit of certainly non-judgment but discarding of the noun and the adjective modes of language. Like red apple. OK. It's a red apple, but then you need to eliminate some other adjectives about it. It's a rotten apple, it's a ripe apple. And instead view the appearance and disappearance of that apple as just a thing, a process as opposed to an event. And now, events, we could really get into the language aspect of it. That just reveals how diminished language is to describe the workings of the brain at some level. I don't know if any of these resonates. But it seems to me, the goal or one of the goals is to start to understand the algorithm that is the fleeting nature of perception but to not focus on any one single perception. And then to not even focused on one single algorithm, but to, at some level, there's a-- what is revealed to the meditator over time is some sort of macroscopic principle about the way perceptions work at a deeper level. That there's a deeper principle there that sits below our-- certainly our normal everyday awareness. But that in paying attention to the mechanics of all this stuff and not judging those mechanics, not naming those mechanics, or just naming them and let them pass by. That there's some action function, some verb is revealed. And that maybe that verb-- may be the word to describe that verb is mindfulness. Maybe mindfulness is really just a verb to describe that. I don't know. Is there anything here? Or am I-- I don't know if I'm creating just like useless straw or if there's actually a seed here of something real. But to me, any time I want to understand something in biology or psychology, I try and broaden the time domain and think in terms of verbs, not nouns or adjectives. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No. That's very useful, and that's somewhat adjacent to this distinction I'm making between dualistic and non-dualistic ways of experiencing the world. So even dualistically, everything is still a process. And we're misled by the reification that noun talk gives us. And this applies not just to something like mindfulness, but even to something like the self. So the sense of self is also a process. I mean, it's a verb, it's not-- so we're self in more than we are ourselves. And there are-- even appropriate uses of the term self that don't go away even when you recognize that the core subject, self, is an illusion. There are states of self where you can recognize in your life that you inhabit very different modes of being depending on the context. So like there are moments where you-- just by walking into a certain building, you suddenly transition into a different state of self. Like suddenly, you pass through a door and now you are a customer in a store, right? So we know what that customer feeling is. Like, you're now the person who's getting the attention. It's a very formalized type of attention from the person who is running the store or a restaurant. You're a customer at a restaurant. That's a-- I just remembered something that's funny. That was born of a mismatch of this. I'll come back to that in a second. So there are-- so we go through it. You can be a student in the presence of a teacher, you're going to be a parent in the presence of a son or a daughter, you can be a spouse in the presence of your spouse. And all of those shadings of-- like the change in context really does usher in some fundamental psychological changes in just the states of consciousness that are available to you. And some of this is really-- I mean, I'm sure we could understand a lot about this personally and generically. But it is pretty mysterious. I mean, there are people who I know who I'm with them in a certain way, and based on something I'm getting off of them, I can't be that-- I'm effortlessly one way with them, and there's no way I could be that way with somebody else. I don't know if it's the pheromones or their facial, just the way they are, their facial expression. But I mean, there are people with whom I'm really kind of effortlessly funny, and there are people with whom I couldn't even-- it would never occur to me to be funny no matter what happened. And I have long standing relationships with these people, so all of that's very mysterious. But anyway, the difference there is not in this core sense of subject in relationship to all the objects, it's in kind of the states of self. And all of that is very verby. All this is a pattern of changes. It's a pattern of what's available and what's not available, the capacities there that come online or not in those various contexts. But no, the memory I just had, which I hadn't had in a long time. But it was one of these moments where I realized the power of these shifts in context for states of self. So once, I was a young man. I think I was probably 22 or so, and single. And like, you're just like, trying to figure out how do you meet women? And how does one get confident to do this well? And I walked into a restaurant and a kind of a woman was walking toward me, toward the front door of the restroom. But she was walking toward me in a way where I just by default assumed she was the hostess in the restaurant. But she wasn't the hostess, she was just someone who had just eaten there, I guess. So I walked through, and she comes out. And so there's a fundamental misunderstanding in me that's set up by literally just this change in architecture. And so I just said hi to her in a way that I presumably I would say hi to any hostess who was coming up to ask me where I wanted to sit. But what had actually happened is I had said hi to a total stranger in a way that I tended at that point never to say hi to total strangers because I was shy and it was just like that. But apparently, I gave her like a 10,000 watt high of all of the confidence you would have if you were that sort of person. And it just ushered in a complete like-- so I went to my table, and this woman, I came back into the restaurant and gave me her phone number, which was something that was just a completely foreign experience to me, and it was based completely on my misunderstanding of the situation I was in. And so anyway-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Among the misunderstandings that one can have and then action and engage in life, I would say that was a somewhat adaptive one. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but then you realize that, OK, but then there are certain people who recognize this machinery to whatever degree or have kind of natural aptitudes for bringing certain things online or not such that they can consciously make these states of self, this level of gregariousness, say, available to them in the circumstances where it's is actually useful to them. So if you're single and you want to meet people, well, it's actually very helpful to feel confident enough to just go say hi to strangers and ask them how they're doing and to be online in that way. Where at that point in my life, in that circumstance, by default, I was going to ignore this stranger who I was passing by in the doorway of a restaurant. But thinking she was the hostess, I was engaging her fully. So anyway, you can consciously-- again, this does not invoke free will at all. But yes, you can consciously decide to play with these mechanisms such that you can decide what states of self would be more normative to have given what you want in life. And you can become increasingly attentive to the ways in which you get played by the world. You're a kind of instrument. Your mind is a kind of instrument. Your brain is a kind of instrument that is continually getting played by the situations you are in, and you can become more of an intelligent curator of your conscious states and your conscious capacities just by noticing the changes in you. Like, in graduate school, it's something I talk about. I think at some point in waking up, this became very stark for me because I was an old graduate student. I had taken 11 years off at Stanford between my sophomore and junior year. So when I went back to school-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Talk about a leave of absence. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but I mean, Stanford had this, you might know this. They have this stop out policy where you never really drop out, you just stop as you want. You can always go back. You don't have to write letters saying that you still exist every two years as you do in other schools. So anyway, I showed up after 11 years. So I was really on a deadline, and I felt late for everything. So I'm kind of finishing my degree as quickly as I can as an undergraduate, and then I jump into graduate school, and I'm an old graduate student. There's a real sense of urgency. Like, I'm late. I should have done this earlier. I want to get this stuff done. But then 9/11 happened. And just as I had finished my coursework getting my PhD, and I was just getting into my research but 9/11 intersected with my life in such a way that I just had to drop everything and write my first book. And I did that. And then I just had to drop everything and write my second book because of the response to the first book. And so essentially, I had like, four years, where I was AWOL doing my PhD. But I still had a toe in the lab and I was still showing up occasionally. But I was becoming this kind of cautionary tale from the point of view of grad school, but I was also becoming kind of a famous or semi-famous writer because my first book had been a New York Times best seller, so I was getting some notoriety as a writer. And so I was doing things like, I was giving a Ted Talk but I still hadn't finished graduate school. So it was I think that timing's is right, maybe I had just finished graduate school when I gave the Ted Talk. But anyway, so I was rowing in two boats and one boat was sinking or showing every sign of being damaged. And I was literally like, getting letters from the head of the department saying, we're concerned about you. But on the other hand, I was becoming a quasi celebrity in that world too, at least in a world that was overlapping. So I was having the experience of going in the moment where this crystallized for me in a fairly peculiar way was, I had a meeting at like 3:00 o'clock with my advisor who was just this guy, Mark Cohen, in the brain mapping center at UCLA who's a fantastic guy. Great advisor. I did not extract as much wisdom from him as I should have. Brilliant scientist. And for him, I'm late. At least, in my head-- he is not that he was riding me so hard but in my head, I'm very self conscious about how I'm not living up to his expectations at this point. So I have a meeting with him at 3:00 o'clock, and I'm just kind of wilting under his gaze and my own imagined inner gaze of his. But two hours later, I have a meeting with his boss, a dinner meeting with his boss who wants to meet with me to get advice on launching his book. We have the same publisher but I'm like, the much bigger author at Norton, and he's coming to me for advice. And so I'm ricocheting between two diametrically opposite self states that are-- again, this comes down to architecture. It's literally like the state I was in walking into one building and then leaving and walking into another building on the same campus. And they were completely opposite self concepts. Like, in one context, I am a fuckup. In another context, I'm a celebrity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you have mastery and virtuosity, and we're developing it very quickly. SAM HARRIS: But so again, this is a kind of a stark version of that. But everyone has some version of this just in bouncing between talking to their mom and then talking to their best friend and then talking to a stranger and talking to someone who's very successful, talking to someone who's not very successful. You notice your vulnerability to all of this stuff. And ultimately, what you want is a level of psychological integrity that is truly divorceable from that. Now, I'm not I'm not saying you're ever going to get it perfect, there's always going to be some-- I mean, I can't talk about the ultimate fulfillment of this process. I'm not a Buddha, I'm not saying I've finished the project. But I think there's more and more as you become sensitive to these changes and you become sensitive to what it's like to actually not be psychologically reactive and not be definable by your own self-concept, your own-- you're not identifying with anything, you're not hanging your hat on anything, you're not thinking about yourself in the kind of terms that you would export to others and then care about what they think about you. There's a kind of invulnerability that arises that's not borne of being well defended, it's born of being evaporated. It's like, you're no longer keeping score in those ways. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Once again, I really appreciate that description because these days, I'm really intrigued by something we've known for a long time that you're certainly familiar with is the prefrontal cortex's ability to establish context dependent rule sets. A Stroop task would be basic example of reading numbers or letters on cards and then switching to having to report the colors that the letters and numbers are written in. It's a basic task. But prefrontal cortex, obviously important for setting context dependent thought and behavior and directed action. But within the context of all these different variations of the self, depending on graduate school or relationship where sitting alone in one's room, there are different rule sets arise and somehow, we are able to have a coherent sense of self that encompasses all of those. Functional people can toggle between them as needed and not overlap them inappropriately. At least not to the extent that it's career failing or life failing. Although there are sad examples of that, many of which exist in the Twitter space. I know several colleagues, not directly of mine, but people who threw mistakes made with their thumbs, where they forgot context or forgot to realize that the context on social media is near infinite. But the context that existed in their head might not be clear in the way that they communicated something, and they lost their jobs by saying what were perceived as insensitive things. In some cases were, in fact, offensive, insensitive things. In some cases, it's debatable. In any case, I think that the image that now comes to mind relates to something you've said several times, that it's not about eliminating something, it's about revealing that something was never actually there. And then in terms of sensory experience and these different aspects of the self, I have this image in my mind of-- I'm not an experienced scuba diver, but I've done enough of it. I've worn a wetsuit. You wear a complete wetsuit with the hood. And this idea if you were born into that wetsuit, you might think that yeah, you nudge up or lean up against a wall and you experience it one way. But were you to shed that wetsuit, you go, wow, there's this incredible landscape of somatosensory experience that I had no idea. It goes way beyond levels of sensitivity. Right now you're talking about fine two point discrimination and light strokes, and this could be positive or negative pain in other ways too. But what you're describing is essentially that the wetsuit was never really there, but was created through a series of action steps. And I think what we're migrating towards here is a set of for most, non-intuitive or non-reflexive action steps that reveal to us that in fact, we're not wearing the wetsuit. Now, you raised one topic, which I think is analogous to this wetsuit, which is this notion of distraction. That normally, distraction is masking what would otherwise be a better experience of life. I can think of distraction as falling into two different bins. One would be the kind of distraction that is internally generated. Like, the fact that thoughts arise and pull me down different alleyways and avenues of my brain and my thoughts and my experience. And that would compete with my ability to really focus on something. And then another form of distraction which captures my ability to focus intensely but has me focusing on the wrong things. And here, I think the judgment of wrong is reasonable to include if, for instance, I'm being impulsively yanked to something on social media. I'm being impulsively yanked to someone else's pain and experience and somehow confusing that with my own experience. This isn't empathy but just being yanked around. My attention as a spotlight is kind of like over here, over there. I'm not feeling as if I'm the one standing behind that spotlight controlling it or I'm not the spotlight, just to keep with what we've been building up here. So could you tell us a little bit about distraction and tell me whether or not these two forms are in any way accurate or inaccurate? I'd be happy for them to be inaccurate. And whether or not there are other forms of distraction that we need to be on the lookout for. And again, I think what most people are seeking is, what is the way to not just enhance our ability to focus but to shed this wetsuit-like cloak that limits our experience that I'm calling and that you've called distraction? SAM HARRIS: Yeah, distraction is one component of it. The other aspect of it is identification with thought. And the feeling of self is bound up in the sense that I'm the thinker, I'm the one attending, I'm the one vulnerable. I'm the inner homunculus that's vulnerable to experience. And it can be gratified by it or not, and it's constantly trying to improve it or mitigate negative aspects of it. It's the sense that there's kind of a rider on the horse of consciousness as opposed to just consciousness and its contents. So again, it rides atop this illusion of control, et cetera. So to go all the way back to the question you asked about, just what is in it, what I recommend as a starting point for meditation. Some of your assumptions are, in fact, true. Yes, I often recommend at the beginning people close their eyes and you do a sitting practice and it's different from a walk in practice. I mean, you can do both, but people tend to start sitting with their eyes closed. But again, ultimately where this is going is it's not an art of-- meditation properly recognized is not an artifice that you're adding to your life. It's not even a practice, it is less rather than more. And therefore, it is also coincident with potentially every waking moment. There's nothing that you can do with your attention once you know how to meditate. That in principle excludes meditation because meditation is just a recognition of an intrinsic character of consciousness in each moment. And all you have in each moment is consciousness and its contents, whatever you're doing. So in the beginning, you'll be very deliberate and precious about deciding to practice meditation, and you'll set aside 10 minutes in the morning, and you'll do that. And it'll seem very different from the next 10 minutes when you're spilling out onto your to-do list and you're trying to figure out what the day looks like. But ultimately, you want to erase this boundary between formal practice and the rest of life such that it's just not remotely findable. And that's achievable. And I think even from the very beginning, you can relax this conceptual distinction between meditation and its antithesis, because it's not at the level of anything you're doing, it's at the level of what's happening in your relationship to thought. Like, what can you notice? It's + transition from the by-stable percept. You're looking at the image and you see nothing. Let's say it's the Dalmatian, it's just the spots on the paper. And you don't see anything. And then all of a sudden the Dalmatian or the face of Jesus or whatever the image is pops out and then you see it, it's the transition from nothing to something. The practice becomes the transition from being lost in thought and then waking up. And breaking the spell of thought, and identification of thought is very much like waking up from a dream and having-- it's like that transition. Like you're having a dream and couple of things are true there. I mean, it's a psychosis that is just not-- we don't problematize because you're safely in bed and you're not moving or unless you've got some kind of sleep disorder. You're not walking around harming yourself or anybody else. But to be in bed and to not know it and to think you're running along a beach or you're getting tried for murder in a court of law or whatever the thing is that you're completely delusional about, that is psychosis. And it's like you're fundamentally unaware of your circumstance. And then two things can happen there. You can either become lucid within the dream, which is interesting, and there's a whole phenomenology of that which can be practiced. But more commonly, you can just wake up from the dream and all of a sudden, the problem you thought you had is no longer there, and you have a completely different context for your conscious life. Now, you know you're safely in bed all the while. There really is something analogous when you break this identification with thought. You're having a thought that seems to be some kind of moral or psychological emergency and yet the moment you see daylight around, the moment you see that the mind is larger than this mere appearance, then suddenly you have a degree of freedom that a moment ago was just unthinkable. And you recognize, you sort of come to in a way, you recognize your circumstance in a way that you weren't a moment ago when you were just talking to yourself, when you were just identical to that conversation. So this is all to say that ultimately, meditation-- I mean, so again, there's another apparent paradox here. Many people who don't know much about meditation will say things like, well, for me, running is my meditation or skiing or rock climbing or playing the guitar or something they like to do that gives them an experience of flow, that's what they go to feel better and that's the opposite of all the chaos of their lives or their time on Twitter or whatever it is. And virtually every case, it's not true to say that that is effectively meditation. By learning to play the guitar, you're not going to learn what I'm calling meditation. And you're not going to learn it by cycling and getting-- no matter how good you get at any of those things, you're not going to learn it by doing those things. But paradoxically, I mean, not really, but it can seem like a paradox. Once you know how to meditate, then you can meditate doing all of those things. Meditation is totally compatible with playing the guitar or skiing or doing any ordinary thing you like to do. So once you know how to meditate, and again, it's totally natural in the beginning to formalize it and to set aside time each day to do it because it is a training. I mean, it is something that in the beginning, you have to get used to. But once you're getting used to it, then there is no good reason not to be experiencing this thing I'm calling meditation, this insight into the center looseness of consciousness, the non-selfhood of consciousness. You should experience it when you're playing your favorite sport or when you're having a conversation with somebody. Then to come back to your initial assumption about eyes closed, a lot of practice, even formal practice can be done eyes open. And it's important to do it as open because so much of our anchoring of our sense of self is based on visual cues. I mean, we know that you can if you give people the right visual cues, you can translocate their sense of self. You can give them an out-of-body experience with a video display, where you can literally make them feel like there's a body swapping illusion. You can make them feel that they're in another person's body looking back at their body if you run the cameras the right way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've done this in VR, seeing an image of-- they create an avatar for you and then your bodily movements generate the movements of the avatar, and you start gaining presence as they call it in the VR lingo very quickly. And then pretty soon, you lose sense of your own bodily representation. And it's a little eerie. What's eerie is to me is going back into, of course never left, but back into your actual body when the VR goggles pop off. The world seems almost overwhelming the number of sensory stimuli that are in a laboratory room, which is actually quite sparse. So exactly what you described, this translocation of notions of self through visual experience. SAM HARRIS: But conversely, when you lose the sense of self, the sense of self I'm talking about, it can be especially vivid and salient with eyes open. Because so many of your reference points to selfhood are delivered visually, especially in a social situation. So like, I'm talking to you, you're looking back at me. So the implication of your gaze is that I'm over here behind my face implicated by your gaze. So the sense that you're looking at something is the sense of self in that social context. And if your facial expression changes, I'm saying something and if you kind of furrow your brow, like, what the hell is he-- and I can read into that facial change, some interstate of yours that is salient to me. All of a sudden, we've got this sort of dance of. Like, I'm noticing you reacting to me, and that's changing the way I'm feeling about what I'm-- That's the purview of every neurosis everyone didn't want, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And every relationship. I had a girlfriend when I was a post-doc who was very, very-- she was brilliant, really, still is. And she always said that every relationship, there are four arrows. She used to say she's a neuroscientist, still is. And said there's the arrow of-- she was talking to me, so she said, me to you and kind of what you perceive coming from me. And then there's you to me, and then there's an arrow from the middle going right back at of each one of us, which is our own perception of what the other person is thinking about us, and it's feeding back on the other arrow. And she gave me this very clear but model of basically relationships. The relationship failed, but it was good while it lasted, I should say. But the four arrow model of relationships actually shows up in every type of one-on-one relationship, and is probably an under description of the total number of arrows. But is I think it's exactly what you're describing is that perception of self through the eyes of other whether or not we're empathic or not strongly shapes the way that we access different context dependent rule sets about what we're going to say or not. And it's very dynamic, right? SAM HARRIS: Yeah. But the freedom that I think we want and people can sometimes experience this just haphazardly, but the center of the bull's eye from the meditative point of view is to get off that ride entirely and to-- so that losing the sense of self in this context of a social encounter is to give up your face, essentially. And what that entails is or what that gives you is the free attention to actually just pay attention to the other person. And the other person is now no longer quite an object in the world for you, there's really just a kind of a totality of which that person is a part. And actually, Martin Buber, the mystical Jewish philosopher talked about the I-thou relationship. And I think it's been a long time since I've read Buber. But and I don't know if he goes far enough to be truly non-dualistic, but there's distinction between I and thou because the thou part of it is, I think, potentially this. Again, it's been several decades since I read him. But there's a way of beholding another person where you have the free attention to simply behold them. You no longer care what they think about you. You don't feel neurotically implicated by their gaze. You don't feel-- you're simply the space in which they're appearing, and so you're free. So by definition, you're no longer self-conscious. And this phrase, self-consciousness, really does get at this, what I'm calling the self, the illusory self as a kind of contraction. And you can notice this for yourself. Just imagine what it's like to go from not being self-conscious to suddenly being self-conscious. And the proximate cause of this almost invariably is suddenly recognizing that somebody is looking at you. It's like you're in a Starbucks and you're alone and you're reading the newspaper or whatever it is. And this now sounds highly anachronistic. It's been three years since I've held a physical newspaper in a Starbucks. But you're just minding your own business. And you look up, and you're seeing a room full of strangers. But then you notice that someone is just looking at you. And so that moment of eye contact, suddenly that throws you back on yourself as a kind of suddenly, you're the object in the world for that other person. That recognition is the tightening there, the kind of contraction there is a further ramification of this feeling most of us have most of the time of being the center of experience. It's like we're all walking around with a fist. And in moments of self-consciousness, the fist gets really tight. And that's the thing that gets fully relaxed when you discover this, what in various point's called the nature of mind or the non-dual nature of consciousness. It's just that there is no center to this experience. And when you recognize no center, then even when your gaze is aimed at another person's gaze, there is no implication going back to the center because there is no center. And rather than that being an experience of weird detachment or confusion, it's actually an experience of greater relationship because you're no longer defending it. You're not defending anything over here. You're not braced against anything, you're just the space in which that person is showing up. And so it's an experience of being much more comfortable in the presence of another person, whatever your relationship, because you're not contracting. Again, and this is meditation. This is meditation that is totally compatible with having a conversation with somebody. And then when you notice your self contracting, when you notice you're not meditating anymore, you're actually reacting. Like, they just said something or looked a certain way and now, you're cast back upon yourself in relationship to them, that becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm. Then it becomes the unsatisfactoriness of that. Psychologically becomes more and more salient. Because one, that's not the way you want to be. I mean, it's like, it's the antithesis of it being as comfortable as you were a moment ago. But two, it's something you're doing unnecessarily. it's like, again, you're making a fist when you don't have to make a fist. Again, you can leave aside all those circumstances where it's appropriate to react to someone. And I'm into martial arts and self defense. And yes, you're not supposed to be just this puddle of goo out in the world who can be just mistreated by people and never put up resistance. But it's psychologically even if a state like anger or contraction is sometimes normative and appropriate, the question is, how long is it normative and appropriate for? How long do you want to stay angry for? In my experience, these kind of classically negative emotions like anger and fear are appropriate as salience cues. They orient you to an emergency or a potential emergency. But then in dealing with the emergency, they're almost never the state you want to be in. Like, it's better to actually be calm in an emergency in a way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely. And again, the language is insufficient to describe what you're telling us. But I think what comes to mind for me is this distinction between situational awareness and self-awareness. And we need both but under conditions of emergency, true emergency, or motivated desire. We need to dial down the amount of self-awareness in order to be more effective within the situational awareness. But you said something very important. And my lab has been working on fear-like states for a long time, so I confess I'm going to rob this from you, but I'll credit you every time I describe it, is that the fear of the threat detection state or set of events acts as a flag but is not meant to persist in the way that the flag went up if one is to be in their most adaptive state. Actually, Jocko Willink and I were talking about this. He talks a lot about detachment and open gaze, things that my lab is interested in visual system and autonomic interactions. So why broadening the gaze literally broadens the time domain of thinking and you come up with new solutions to complex problems in real time and so on. And you're describing an everyday set of interactions where that could be very useful. And yet, there seems to be something that about the way you describe meditation and what you've managed to arrive at and what practitioners of meditation can arrive at, which is something more than that. It's not just about being effective or optimizing, all the language we see thrown around a lot in the space that I live in these days, but something fundamentally more important about how to experience life and the self. This realization that what you thought was there was never really there, but that there are constraints that limit that. And so to try and fracture those constraints one by one. Would you say that meditation as a practice done for a few minutes each day or with the app, that it's kind of a step function? Is it very non-linear in terms of people's progress? I'm certainly going to go start doing more meditation based on this discussion, truly. Because any time someone describes that there's kind of a myth that we've been living in, I become obsessed with the idea of dissolving that myth. That's a very seductive phrase, so thank you for using that one. There is no better marketing tool, which is I realize what you're not trying to do here. But that's for me to capture my efforts. You tell me that there's a myth that I'm living in and that it can be dissolved, and that opens up a better landscape. What is the process like? Do some people make progress very quickly? Do some people experience kind of step functions towards progress? What does the meditation practice look like over time? Do you still meditate or have you just threaded it through your jujitsu, your writing, your daily life, your coffee, your time with your wife, et cetera? SAM HARRIS: Yeah, also just to come back to talk about the myth for a second. So what you just enunciated was a kind of a second doorway into this whole project. So like, the usual door is through the door of suffering, for lack of a better word. When people feel unhappy in a variety of ways and they get more sensitized to the mechanics of their own unhappiness. And meditation is one of the things on the menu that is explicitly built as a remedy for unhappiness. And it is. And that's I think that's probably the most common path to this. But another path is just intellectual interest. I mean, just wanting to know what's real about the mind subjectively in a first person way. And there's no contradiction between those two things, and I'm motivated by both of them. But it's a totally valid doorway into this. There are definitely step functions. I mean, I would say there are at least two, and they really are articulated along the lines of the framework I've been describing of dualistic and non-dualistic mindfulness. So in the beginning, you're going to start out-- 99.9% of people will start out dualistically paying attention and noticing the difference between being distracted by thought and then being on the object of attention, whether it's the breath or sounds or whatever. And eventually, that opens up to all possible objects of attention, including thoughts. And there's still this fluctuation between being distracted and then being mindful of whatever. And the fact that it's open to all possible objects differentiates this type of practice from anything that is narrowly focused on one object like a mantra or a visualization as I was just saying. Those are other paths of practice that are more concentration-based and interesting. But the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly, you realize it's by definition compatible with all possible experience, because you're not artificially contracting your attention down to something, you're just being aware of the next thing. A sight, a sound, a taste, a thought. So the first step function is to very clearly experience the difference between being lost in thought and being clearly aware of any part of experience, including thought. And to notice the freedom, the comparative psychological freedom that gives. So something's made you angry and now you're thinking about all the reasons why you should be angry and have every right to be angry and what you're going to tell that person when you see them, and then you notice you're thinking. And you notice the connection between the thought and the anger. Like, the minute spent lost in thought about what's making you angry is the thing that dragged through the physiology of anger. And the moment you notice that once you're mindful, once you can be mindful, you can notice thought as thought and how quickly that dissipates. That's just the language and the imagery. You couldn't hold on to it if you wanted to. And then you notice the physiology of the anger is just this kind of meaningless, kind of inner incandescence that has its own half life and degrades very, very quickly when you're no longer thinking about the reasons why you should be angry. You can't hold on to the anger, the anger itself dissipates. And from the point of view of the one who's being mindful, this is tremendous relief. And at minimum, it's a degree of freedom. You can at that point decide, well, how long do I want to be angry for? Is it useful to stay angry? Do I want to be angry for one minute, two minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes? And before you have that capacity to be mindful, you're going to helplessly be as angry as you're going to be for as long as you're going to be that way just based on the time course of your thinking about it, brooding about it, telling your wife about it. It's just going to be this conversation-based misadventure in negative states of mind, and you are going to be the hostage of that for as long as you'll be the hostage of that. You have nothing you can do apart from just deciding to check out and watch Game of Thrones again for the third time. You can divert your attention to something else, which is sometimes a good thing to do. But mindfulness, even dualistic mindfulness gives you this capacity to just observe the mechanics of this and then get off the ride whenever you want. So that really is a step function. First, there was a time before you could do that, and then there's a time after which you can do that. The other step function is noticing that there is no one who is doing that. I mean, this is the non-duality, the selflessness, the centralessness of awareness. The fact that there's no place from which the mindfulness is being aimed but the fact that there's just this open condition in which everything is appearing, thoughts included. To have you at that point, your mindfulness no longer becomes-- it's no longer this dualistic effort to strategically pay attention to anything as opposed to being lost in thought, it's just what's left when the present recognized thought unravels. Even before it unravels, what's recognized is you are simply identical to the condition in which everything is appearing. Now, again, I'm not making a Deepak Chopra-like metaphysical claim about the mind. I'm not saying the mind isn't what the brain is doing, and I'm not saying that you're recognizing the consciousness that gave birth to the universe. I'm not making any broad claims about metaphysics, I'm just talking about as a matter of experience. There is just this condition in which everything is appearing. And what you're calling your body, again, as a matter of experience-- I'm not saying that we can't have third person conversations about physical bodies in the physical world. But as a matter of experience, the only body you're ever going to directly encounter as your own is in appearance and consciousness. So consciousness is not in your body, what you're calling your body is in consciousness. Visually, proprioceptively, it's like everything is just appearing in this condition. And again, this is not a spotlight that you're aiming at the body, there's just this condition in which everything, including anything you could call yourself is appearing. And so yeah, the second step function is to recognize that this is already true. Consciousness is already without this thing you've been calling your ego and hoping to unravel it through meditation. Consciousness is not going to get any more selfless, any more centerless, any freer than it always already is recognized as such. And so the step function at that point is your mindfulness at that point, the thing you come back to when you're no longer distracted is that recognition again and again. And then it becomes compatible with anything you would do. And so to answer your question, yes, I still practice formally, sometimes, frequently. But I definitely miss days and I don't do it for-- I mean, I don't rule out the possibility that I will go back on retreat at various times just to check in with that and see if that makes a difference. But I tend to sit for-- I mean, I've designed my life so that I can spend a lot of time meditating without having to be formally meditating. Like, so, I'll go for a hike for two hours. And what I'm doing when I'm hiking is identical to what I'm doing when I'm quote, "meditating", sitting in a chair, doing nothing but meditate. So yeah, I'm very interested in erasing the boundary between what people are calling meditation and the rest of life. And so in teaching these things, I tend to emphasize that from the beginning because I think it's very easy to set up-- to get gold by a bunch of assumptions that cause you to be very split in your sense of what your life is about. And I'm sort of banking my meditation over here because I'm meditating two hours a day diligently, and it's going to be really good for me. And then over here, this is the rest of my life, which is not nearly as wise or as useful or as like, this is the stuff that is still the area of my problems. And I think it's useful to recognize you've got one life, and you've got this single condition of consciousness, and its contents in every mode of life. And there's something to recognize about it. And you're always free to recognize that. And truly even in your dreams. I mean, it never stops. So that's what I tend to emphasize. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So earlier, you told us that meditation is not about changing the content of conscious experience. And in a different podcast that you were on, I heard you say something to the effect of that normally we are in our daily experience and unless we are trained in meditation, unless we've dissolved this illusion of the gap between actor and self and observer, that we require certain sensory events to create collisions within us and with the natural world that sort of blast us into a different mode of being. I want to use that as a way to frame up this idea that some things such as psychedelics but also a very long hike, a very long fast, who knows? A banquet, different types of life experiences do exactly the opposite of what you're describing meditation does, which is that they actively change the content of our conscious experience so much so that we often remember those for the rest of our lives. Could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful? And here, I'll give the caveats that maybe you'll feel obligated to give as well, but we're talking about safely and responsibly, age-appropriate, context-appropriate, ideally with some clinical or other type of guidance, legality issues, obeyed, et cetera. All that stated, it was psychedelics to me are an experience of altered perception, internal and external perception, altered space time relationship, somewhat dreamlike. I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long time talked about the relationship between psychedelic-like states and dream-like states because of this distortion of space time dimensionality. And I haven't experimented with them much. I've been part of a clinical trial, three doses of MDMA, which certainly altered the quality of my conscious experience in ways that led to a lot of lasting and at least for me, valuable learning. So what are your what are your thoughts about psychedelics in terms of how they intersect with the discussion that we've been having? And what utility do they play in recognition of the self or in other sorts of brain changes? SAM HARRIS: Well so, let's just price in all those caveats that people can anticipate. These drugs are not without their risks. And one problem is that we have this single-term drugs or psychedelics, which names many different types of substances, and they're not all the same. So like, MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic. I think it has immense therapeutic value, and it actually was my gateway drug to this whole area of concern. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine pathogen, right? It's a sort of an amphetamine and a pathogen at the same time. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean it's, often called-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: M pathogens. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, and a pathogen-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a pathogen, M pathogen. SAM HARRIS: And a pathogen or an entactogen, it's been called. But it doesn't tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do. And it's also serotonergic, but it has to be in some part differently. And even LSD and psilocybin, which are much more similar and classic psychedelics, both are also serotonergic but they're not merely, and they're also different. And the higher dose you take of these drugs, the more-- at lower doses everything, can kind of seem the same. At higher doses, they begin to diverge. And we can talk about the pharmacology if you wanted to. But I would just say that for many of us, and certainly for me, psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning in proving to me that this was-- the first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing. Because I was somebody who at age 17 or 18, before I had any real experience with MDMA or LSD or psilocybin, if you had taught me how to meditate at that point, I think I would have just bounced off the whole project. I think I was so cerebral in just my engagement with anything. I was so skeptical of any of the religious and spiritual traditions that have given us most of our meditation talk that I think I just would have-- And I know many of these people. I have tried to teach Richard Dawkins to meditate and Daniel Dennett to meditate. I've ambushed them with meditation both in a group setting and one-on-one. Not Dan but Richard, I ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation. And he closes his eyes, he looks inside, and there's nothing of interest to see. He doesn't have the conceptual interest in him that would cause him to persist long enough to find out that there's a there there. Now, this is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA. I know that if I gave him 100 micrograms of LSD or 5 grams of mushrooms or 25 milligrams of psilocybin-- that's probably not the analogous dosage to the 5 grams of mushrooms. 5 grams of mushrooms would be more than that. I forget what it is of MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think the maps dose, which is the one that's under clinical trials is 125 milligrams with an option of a 75 milligram booster. Funny, I remember it. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, that's strange, the facts that come to hand. But there's just no possibility that nothing's going to happen right now. Something with a psychedelic, with MDMA, most people tend to have certainly under any kind of guidance, tend to have a very positive, pro-social experience. But with a psychedelic, you might have a somewhat terrifying experience if you have quote, a bad trip. And I've certainly had those experiences on LSD and to some degree, on psilocybin. But the prospect that nothing is going to happen is just in nearly a million cases out of a million just not in the cards. I mean, just neurophysiologically, something is going to happen with the requisite dose of one of these drugs. And if that thing that happens is psychologically at all normative and pleasant and interesting and valuable, which it is so much of the time and certainly under the appropriate set and setting and guidance, it can be a lot of the time for virtually everybody. Again, there are caveats. If you're prone, if you think you have a proclivity for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, this is almost certainly not for you. And anyone doing the studies at Johns Hopkins for the therapeutic effects of any of these drugs, they're there ruling out people with-- first degree relatives with any of these clinical conditions. So for somebody like me at 18 who didn't know that this was an area of not only interest but would it be the center of gravity for the rest of his life, if only he could pay attention clearly enough to see that it could be, I was someone who very likely-- again, I don't have the counterfactual in hand. I don't know what would have happened if someone had forced me to meditate for an hour at that point. But I know I wasn't interested in it until I took MDMA. I know I wasn't having these kinds of experiences spontaneously that showed me that there was an inner landscape that was worth exploring. I was a very hard-headed skeptic who was very interested in lots of things, but there was no alternative to me just thinking more about those things. I mean, the idea that there's some other way of grasping cognitively at the interesting parts of the world beyond thinking about the world, that just wouldn't have computed for me at all. No one ever gave me a book to read or I never had-- The noun, meditation, very likely meant absolutely nothing to me before I took my first dose of, in this case it was MDMA. So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved-- So one of the limitations of drug is that, obviously, no matter how good the experience, the drug wears off and then you're back to in more or less your usual form, and now you have a memory of the experience. And it can be a fairly dim memory. I mean, some of these experiences are so discontinuous with normal waking consciousness that it can be like trying to remember a dream that just degrades over the course of seconds. And then it could have been the most intense dream you've ever had and for whatever reason, you can barely get a purchase on what it was about. And there are some psychedelic experiences that are analogous to that. But for most people most of the time, there's a residue of this experience. And with something like MDMA, they can be quite vivid. Where you recognize there was a way of being that is quite different than what I'm tending to access by default, and it is different in ways that are just obviously better and psychologically more healthy. I mean, it's possible to be healthy psychologically in a way that I never imagined. And then when you link it up to the traditional literature around any of this stuff, again, so much of it is shot through with superstition and other worldliness of religion. And as you know and I think you're listeners probably know, I've spent a lot of time criticizing all that. But there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that. It's not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs of the world's religions, it's not that they were all conscious frauds or temporal lobe epileptics, there's a pathological lens that you can put on top of all that. But once you have one of these experiences on psychedelics or on a drug like MDMA, you know that there's a there there. You know that unconditional love is a possibility. You know that feeling truly one with nature. I mean, just so one with nature that you could spend 10 hours in front of a tree and find that to be the most rewarding experience of your life. That's a possible state of consciousness. Now, it may not be the state of consciousness you want all the time. You don't want to be the crazy guy by the tree you know who can't have a conversation about anything else. But once you have one of these experiences, you recognize, OK, there's some reason why I'm not having the beatific vision right now. And I can't even figure out how to aim my attention so as to have anything like it. And that's a problem, because it's available, and it is among the best things that has ever happened to me. And now I can just only dimly remember what that was like. So how do I get back there on some level? So that invites, again, a logic of changes. A logic of seeking changes in the contents of consciousness, which sets someone up for this protracted or seemingly protracted and fairly frustrating search to game their nervous system so as to have those kinds of experiences more and more. And again, it's not that that's in principle fruitless but it is from the point of view of the core insight, the core wisdom of what I would take from a tradition like Buddhism, which is not the only tradition that has given voice to this, but I would argue it's given it voice to it in the most articulate way. Again, leaving aside any of the superstition and other worldliness and miracles that we don't have to talk about at the moment. And you certainly don't need to endorse in order to be interested in this stuff. And so that's the bifurcation between all of the utility of psychedelics and what I'm talking about under the rubric of meditation is at this point of OK, once you realize there's a there there, what do you do? And what's the logic by which you're led to do it? And it's possible if you're only framework is the good experiences, the good feels you had on whatever drug it was and a further discussion of what that path of changes can look like-- and that can become in a religious context, it can come in just a purely psychedelic context or some combination of the two. I think you can be misled to just seek lots of peak experiences. You're just trying to string together a lot of peak experiences hoping they're going to change you, every one of which, by definition is going to be impermanent. It's first it wasn't there, then it's there, and then it's no longer there. And then you've got a memory of it. What I think what everyone really wants whether they know it or not, and they're right to want, is a type of freedom that is compatible with even ordinary states of consciousness, which can ride along with them into extraordinary states of consciousness. So I hadn't done psychedelics for 25 years because, again, they were super useful for me in the beginning, then I discovered meditation on the basis of those experiences, got really into meditation and realized, OK, this is a much more-- conceptually, this makes much more sense to me. This is delivering the goods in terms of my experience. There's no need to keep having these-- seeking these peak experiences with drugs. But it had been 25 years since I had done that and there was this resurgence in research on psychedelics. And I was being asked about psychedelics, and I was talking about their utility for me, but again, these were distant memories. And there was also one type of psychedelic experience I was aware that I had never had. I had never done a high dose of mushrooms blindfolded. Every mushroom trip I'd ever had I'd been out in nature and interacting with-- it's just been a very transformed sensory experience of the world and of other people. But I'd never done it alone, blindfolded, just purely inwardly directed, and at a high dosage. I'd done high doses of LSD but not mushrooms. So I did that and it was very useful. And I spoke about it on my podcast, and there's actually-- I think if you search "Sam Harris mushroom trip" on YouTube, you get the 19 minute version of my describing that trip. It was incredibly useful, but what was doubly useful was my mindfulness training in the context of that explosion of synesthesia. I mean, it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience, and there were so many moments where it could have gone one way or the other based on my sense of just, OK, I'm going to try to resist this. It was in truth irresistible because it was just so much, but there were moments where I was aware of, OK, this is-- letting go of self in this context is the thing that is going to make the difference between heaven and hell here because there are experiences that are so extreme that you can't even tell if it's agony or ecstasy. Everything is turned up to 11. And the difference between the two is-- the tipping point is just-- really it's a high wire act in some sense. You could just fall to one side or the other. Yeah, so what I think people want is-- they certainly want to be able to extract from the psychedelic experience, wisdom that is applicable to ordinary states of consciousness. It's like, what is the thing you can realize in a moment of having a conversation with your child that isn't distracting you from that relationship? It's not a memory of when the world dissolved or when you were indistinguishable from the sky, but it's just a way of having free attention and unconditional love in this totally ordinary and potentially chaotic human experience, which can be psychologically fraught and you can meet iterations of yourself that you don't like that are not equipping you to be the best possible person in that relationship. And what we want to do is cut through all of that and actually be in love with our lives and with the people in our lives more and more of the time. And I'm not saying that repeated psychedelic journeys can't be integral to that project, but you know that the project can't be being high all the time. So whatever is extractable from the occasional psychedelic trip has got to be manageable into ordinary waking consciousness. And the real point of contact does run through this-- what I've been calling the illusion of the self. And again, that part is discoverable without any changes in contents. So you don't have to suddenly feel the energy of your body rush out and be continuous with the ocean of energy that is not your body. That's an experience that's there to be had, I mean, there's no doubt. But the truth is just looking at this cup is just as formless and as mysterious as that when seen in the right way, and that's what meditation encourages one to recognize. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I share the experience that MDMA significantly altered my perception of what's possible in terms of an emotional stance towards self and others, including animals, something that runs very deep for me and that I had been actively suppressing in anticipation of having me put my dog down. But also, I don't know how to frame it except to say, my lab did animal research for years, and I was always very conflicted about it because I love animals and yet I wanted to understand the brain and we need to work on animal brains, and we-- SAM HARRIS: Rodents or what? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'll be very direct about this. I've worked on many species. I've worked on mice and rats. Admittedly, I've worked on-- I've done some cat experiments. I've worked on large, non-human primates including macaques. I no longer work on any of those species. I've worked on cuttlefish, cephalopods, a discussion for another time, brilliant little creatures, maybe as smart as us, or who knows? Maybe smarter. And now I work on humans because I couldn't reconcile the challenge inside me, which was my love of animals and working on them. I just couldn't do it any longer. And MDMA didn't set that transition, that transition actually had been set a lot earlier. It's something I really grappled with. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was always in the back of my mind. In any event, I hope what we discovered was worthwhile, but this that's a bigger debate. And I've strong feelings about this, and maybe it's a topic for another podcast. But I'm very happy that now I work on humans, and they can tell me if they want to be part of the experiment or not, and I trust them and I trust their answers. I think that MDMA, in its role as an pathogen, I think really did set an understanding of what's real and true. So I think truths like that become-- I felt that they didn't hit me square in the face. The feeling behind the conflict made itself evident, and what to do about it made itself evident. So I suppose MDMA did assist the transition to purely human research, as opposed to animal research. The other thing that I noticed it did is it made it not scary to confront things that were scary to confront in my conscious life. And I could think about things in my conscious life, but it brought them close in a way that I could get closer and closer to the flame and then gain some understanding. I'm still amazed at how answers arrive, both during the session and in the weeks and months that follow if one puts the attention to it. I think that's why it's important to have a guide of some sort or to have some pseudo structure because otherwise one can get attached to the sounds in the room. And there's probably meaning there, but I wanted to do some deeper work. I have not had experience with psilocybin, at least not since my youth. And I don't recommend young people do it. I regret doing LSD and psilocybin as a young person. I don't say that for politically correct reasons or liability reasons, I just think my mind was not developed. But I'm intrigued by something-- so here's the question-- how is it that psilocybin in particular and high dose psilocybin and the ego dissolution that people talk about on psilocybin-- how do you think that lines up with some of the experiences that you've been describing for a adequate meditation practice? Because that's something that I did not experience on MDMA. In fact, if anything, I experienced for the first time what really feeling like a isolated container was, and the difference-- and how empathy and being bounded-- having, in other words, good boundaries and empathy could be symbiotic. I experienced that for the first time there. And I do think that there is learning inside of these states that translates into everyday life when one is not on these states. And the last thing I'll say is, no, I don't feel the impulse to go and do 20 more MDMA sessions. I think the three as part of this study were very effective for me. As I say, if you hear the calling again you might do it, but I'm very curious about psilocybin in particular and this notion of ego dissolution because we've been talking about the self. SAM HARRIS: Well, so there are different ways In which the sense of self can be eroded or expanded. There's lots of experiences that can still have a center to them but be very novel and transformational. And one can reify those as a goal state. There's a concept in Buddhism that I think is useful. It doesn't translate well to English, or it can set up false associations in English that are unfortunate. But so there's a concept of emptiness in Buddhism, which sounds, again, gray and dispiriting in English, but it's cognate terms are things like unconditioned, unconstrained, open, centralist. When I'm talking about non duality, when I'm talking about the loss of a sense of subject and then what's left, in Buddhism, they would often describe what's left as emptiness. But an emptiness is not a something. Importantly, it's not the same thing as unity, so it's not a oneness because it's-- When the center drops out of experience, it's not like you are suddenly merged with the cup. Now, granted, this is where psilocybin and other psychedelics can give a false impression of I think what the goal is. You can have seeming merging experiences-- you can have unity experiences on psychedelics, which can be quite powerful, especially with other people and with nature, where you can just feel the energy of your body becomes incredibly vivid and powerful. It's like everything is just buzzing with life energy. And then when you touch another person's hand or you touch a tree, there can be this continuity of energy, which can be this overwhelming experience. And again, this is a 20 megaton change in the contents of consciousness. This is a non ordinary state of consciousness. To give some indication of how this happens-- back in the day when I was in my 20s and I was experimenting with-- this was LSD, but some friends and I had decided-- we had this brilliant idea. We would camp above Muir woods and then take some LSD at dawn and then walk down like a mile I think from the campsite into the actual proper grove of trees and commune with the giant redwoods, the tallest trees on Earth. And so we dropped the acid at dawn, and we start walking, but the acid came on almost immediately. And we didn't get-- I mean, we got nowhere near the woods, and we got stopped by a tree that was just like an ordinary 20 foot oak tree, the most boring tree in the world. And that tree absorbed the next six hours of our conscious attention because it was just-- it was the tree of life. I mean, there could be no better tree. So we're talking about nonordinary states of consciousness wherein a merging with life and with the world is possible. So I'm not saying that kind of experience isn't possible, but there's a sort of expanded self reification. It is a kind of ego dissolution, but there's a kind of egoity that goes along for the ride as well, or can go along for the ride. And the real insight into emptiness, the real centerless center of the bull's eye is a recognition that in some ways equalizes all experiences. And again, it's just as available now in this ordinary podcasting experience as it is when you're merging hands on with an oak tree, and on 400 micrograms of acid, and this is the whole universe. And so it's the equality of those two experiences that this concept of emptiness captures, which a concept of oneness doesn't quite capture because oneness is really this peak experience of being dragged out of your somethingness into a much bigger somethingness. Emptiness is just no center and then everything is in its own place. There's still sights, and sounds, and sensations, and thoughts, and feelings, but there's no there's no center and there's no clinging to anything. There's no clinging to identity, there's no clinging to the good stuff, there's no there's no resistance to the bad stuff. So pleasant and unpleasant get strangely equalized, and it's very expansive. And most importantly, it doesn't block anything. So yeah, if for whatever reason if your nervous system is set up to have the, oh my god, I'm now merging with the tree experience, that's possible from the state of no center. And on my recent-- now not so recent, three years ago, it was right before COVID, but my last big psychedelic experience, I was very much experiencing that. Whereas, insofar as I-- at the peak, there was no me to remember any of this stuff. But insofar as I could experiment with-- is this really different from anything else? There is a equalizing to the emptiness recognition, even in the presence of a completely transformed neurophysiology. Again, there's a point of contact. I mean, the real point of contact between psychedelics and meditation for me is-- but for my experiences on psychedelics, I think there's just no way I would have had the free attention to be interested in the project at all. And there are other aspects to the project. It's not just having this insight into selflessness, it's all of the ethical ramifications of that. It's just like, what kind of person do you want to be? What are your values? What is a good life, altogether, when you are talking about relationships, and political engagement, and the changes you can make in the world or not make? It's just, what kind of person do you want to be? There's a much larger consideration. And I mean, as you discovered, an experience on MDMA can really both expand your model of what is possible, and what is desirable, what is normative. I mean, just what kind of self do you want to be in the world? And it can also help you cut through things that are inhibiting your actualizing any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've certainly found that to be the case. I mean, you raise a really important point, which is that once these learnings take place, these understandings take place inside of psychedelic journeys-- I do believe they translate to neuroplasticity. I do want to highlight the point for people. Oftentimes people say, oh, you know, this mushroom or this psychedelic it opens plasticity, but of course, plasticity has to be directed someplace. Plasticity is just a process like walking or anything else, underlying neural process. And I think it's impossible for me to understand what compartments of my life have been impacted by these three MDMA sessions. But in some ways, I wonder whether or not, not just the transition away from animal research, but also a deeper realization of the love for learning and sharing information. I won't go so far as to say this podcast is happening because of that particular session, but these things they splay out into multiple domains of the self. And I do think that the key features that feel most important to me to mention are that it really identified true loves, things that I truly love, and made me less cautious about feeling how intense those loves really are. And then also lowered the inhibition point of exploring, well, what would that mean? And one of the reasons I bring this up, and why I think it's so important that you mentioned some issues around politics and ethics and that many things have splayed out from your exploration of psychedelics, meditation, neuroscience, philosophy, all the things that are you, and of course, that's only a subset, is that so much of what I hear and see, so much of what I hear and see in the self-help space, contradicts itself and leads back to the origin without a lot of progress. For instance, we hear absence makes the heart grow fonder but then out of sight, out of mind. You hear about radical acceptance, but then what if it's radical acceptance of non acceptance? I mean, there are some experiences in people for which I radically accept the fact that I want nothing to do with them. Am I supposed to transcend that? So these are the questions I think that keep a lot of people from exploring things like meditation because they feel like, well, is the idea to just be OK with everything? Is radical acceptance just like-- we'll just bulldoze me with things even if they-- and my goal is to somehow surpass the idea that they're harmful. And I don't think that's actually the way any of this stuff is supposed to work, although I don't claim to be the authority on it either. I think notions of radical acceptance, and radical honesty, and any number of different sayings that one can find out there are really the most salient beacons and guides that most people have in order to try and navigate tough areas in their life, including the relationship to self, but others and political orientations. And so I feel like almost all those things can be used to anchor down in a stance that may or may not be informed or to open up to ideas. And so I think that none of this can really be solved in a single practice it sounds like, but it does seem to me, based on what you've told us today, is that only through a deep understanding of the self as it really is, as opposed to this illusion that you framed up, could we actually arrive at some answers about what's actually right for each and every one of us. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, there's one generic answer that I think can be extracted both from psychedelics and from meditation and from just thinking more clearly about the nature of our lives. And it's to become more process oriented, and to be more and more sensitive to the mirage like character of achieving our goals. Now, I'm not against achieving goals. I have a lot of goals. I'm very busy. There are lots of things I want to get done, and I'm satisfied as anyone to finish a project. But if you look at the time course of all of that fulfillment and-- there are a few lessons everyone I think has to draw. One is, most of your life is spent in the process. The moment at which the goal is fully conquered, that is just-- I mean, that has a tiny duration, and it has a very short half life. The moment you arrive at it, it begins to recede because, in the meantime, you have all these other goals that have appeared on the horizon. You've got people asking what you're going to do next, and in some sense, if you're focused on goals, you can never arrive. And I think what we're all looking for in life, whether we're ever thinking about taking psychedelics or practicing something like meditation, we're looking for good enough reasons to let our attention fully rest in the present. That is the logic of success. The sense like, I've got all these things I want to do-- if I could just get rich enough, or fit enough, or dial in my sleep well enough, or improve my life in all of these ways, get the right relationship, wouldn't it be great to be married, I want to start a family, I want all of these things. Why do I want these things? I want these things because I'm telling myself-- all of those things are wonderful, I'm not I'm not discounting those relative forms of happiness or sources of happiness because it's all completely valid, it's completely valid to want those things. But one thing is absolutely clear, it's possible to be miserable in the presence of all of those things. And you can add great wealth, and fame, and everything on top of that, and It's possible to be absolutely miserable having everything anyone could seemingly want. You just have to open a newspaper just to see people living out that predicament-- spectacularly wealthy, famous, healthy, successful people who could do anything they want in life, apparently, and yet they're doing this thing that is completely dysfunctional and making them needlessly miserable. I won't name names, ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's enough of them out there. SAM HARRIS: Some people come to mind at the moment. So there is a clear dissociation between having everything and happiness that's possible. And it's also possible to have very little, and almost nothing, and to be quite happy. I mean, you might not have met these people, but I have met people who have spent 10 years alone in a cave. And they come out of that cave not floridly neurotic or psychotic, they come out of that cave beaming with compassion and joy. And I mean, they've been taking MDMA for 10 years, essentially, and they come out of the cave and now they're going to talk about it. And I'm not necessarily recommending that project to anyone. I'm just saying, that is a psychological possibility. So you have a double dissociation here, whether you can have everything and be miserable, or you can have nothing and be beaming with happiness. So what is it that we actually want in all of our seeking to arrange the props in our lives and to have a convincing enough story to tell about ourselves that we're doing the right thing? What is all of that effort predicated on? It's predicated on this desire and this expectation that if we could get all of this stuff in the right place and not have anything terrifying to worry about, everyone we love is healthy for the moment, and we're healthy, and we've got something to look forward to on the weekend, and there's not a plumbing leak in the house that we have to immediately respond to, and we like our house, and our career is going fine, and there's something good to watch on Netflix, and we have all of it, now can we just actually give up the war? Can we fully locate our sense of wellbeing in the present moment? Can we relax the impulse to brood about the past or think anxiously about the future for long enough to discover that all of this here is enough? Because our life our life is-- we have this finite resource of-- I mean, we absolutely have the finite resource of time, but within this the finite continuum of time, we have the even more precious resource of free attention that can find our fulfillment in the present. Because even if we're even if we're guarding our time to do the things that are most important to us, we can spend all of that time regretting the past, or anxiously expecting the future, and just bouncing between past and future in our thinking about ourselves and our lives, and basically just dancing over the present and never making contact with it. So I think what we want is a circumstance where a tension can be located in the present in a way that's truly fulfilling. And unless you have had some kind of radical insight that allows you to do that on demand, you are in some sense hostage to the circumstances of your life to do that for you. You're constantly trying to engineer a state of the world that will propagate back on a state of self that will make the present moment good enough. And what meditation does, and psychedelics to some degree does this, but meditation very directly does this, it reverses the causality and lets you actually change state such that you can be fulfilled before anything happens. Your happiness is no longer predicated on the next good thing happening. You can be in the presence of the next good or bad thing already being fulfilled and already being at peace. I mean, there's a-- I think there are misleading nouns we can throw at what is left there, but it is tranquility, peace, freedom, lack of contraction, lack of conflict. I mean, all of that can be more and more of a default. And all of that is also compatible with deciding, yeah, why not get in shape? Why not engage this project? Why not change your career? I mean, it's not it's not that you need to be somebody who-- I mean, to your point, you can notice all of these non optimal things because no matter how much you meditate, you're very likely going to spend a lot of your time still lost in thought, still identified with it, and still caring about the difference between dysfunction and normativity in your life. The question is, what can you what can you locate when-- the question, it's like, how much can you puncture that seeking happiness project with the recognition that you're already free? That's what meditation makes possible. You can keep just 1,000 times a day letting some daylight into this search space. But it is still compatible. I mean, working out is a great frame in which to look at this because, I mean, in working out, when you really work out-- I'm thinking mostly of-- I mean, it's really anything, but it's resistance training, or cardio, or something like jujitsu. You're intentionally putting yourself in classically unpleasant circumstances, physiologically. I mean, imagine what it's like to do anything to failure. Well, if you just check in on what that is like at the level of sensation, I mean, that is basically-- it feels like a medical emergency. If you were having that experience for some other reason, like if you woke up in the middle of the night and felt what it feels like to be deadlifting on your 10th rep on a set where you would fail at 11, that's an emergency. But because you understand what you're doing in the gym, and you've sought out, and it's actually something you like doing, and you can get a real dopamine hit from doing it, what you're doing when you're doing that is you're owning a-- you're actually transforming a classically negative experience into something that's almost intrinsically positive, certainly the net on it is positive. Being able to do that is more and more the experience of being actually at peace, even while exerting really intense effort in one direction. So you can be straining, and I'm sure physiologically showing a lot of stress, I mean, I'm sure the cortisol is up, and blood pressure's up, heart rate is certainly up. So it's like, as far as the body is concerned, it's stress as far as the eye can see. But you really can be deeply equanimous and at peace, again, because of the frame around it, because of the concepts attached to it, because you know what you're doing, you know why it's happening, and you want it. So that's an attitude you can bring into other stressful things that take effort to accomplish. And so it's not that you just need to be a pushover when you learn how to meditate, or when you take MDMA, or work on yourself in any of these ways. But what I think you want to find is you want to find your point of rest in the midst of any struggle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would say that, certainly MDMA but, and again, I have less experience with meditation, but they really I think put us, ultimately, in positions of what can only refer to as real strength. These can make what before seemed like impossible decisions, or even concepts or emotional states to even think about for any period of time without deliberately distracting or avoiding in some other way and be able to lean into those with open eyes. To me that's my definition of strength. I don't know what other people consider. But there's definitely something real there in each case. This may seem like a divergence but I and many other people are very curious about a recent decision that you made, which was to close your account on Twitter. You still have an Instagram account I noticed. SAM HARRIS: I mean, my team manages that. I've never-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a lot friendlier over at Instagram. I've been there a lot longer-- SAM HARRIS: I've never even seen it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, it's pretty good actually, considering-- imagine what would happen if you did pay attention. They're doing a good job with it. But your decision to close your account on Twitter I think grabbed a lot of eyes and ears, and there's a lot of questions about why. It was a very large account. It correlated with a number of things that, for the outsider, people might be wondering about new leadership, people who had been booted off, brought back on, or at least invited back on, and so on. You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior to me or anybody else for that matter. But I'm curious if you might share with us what the motivation was for taking the account down, and how you feel in the absence of-- I mean, your thumbs presumably are freed up to do other things. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I was getting like an arthritic right thumb I think, and I think it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you don't mind sharing, I think there's a lot of curiosity about you and your routines. You've been very generous in sharing your knowledge, but also what makes you tick, what motivates pretty big decisions like that? It was a major platform for you. SAM HARRIS: Right, yeah, so it was the only social media platform I've ever engaged. I mean, like you said, I have an Instagram, I have a Facebook account, but I've never used those as platforms. I was never on them, I've never followed people. All the posting has just come from-- it's just marketing from my team. But Twitter was me, I mean, for better or worse, and I began to feel more and more for worse. And it was interesting because it was very-- I've talked about it a lot of my podcast, about my love/hate relationship with Twitter over the years. Many good things came to me from Twitter, and I was following a lot of smart people. And it had become my newsfeed and my first point of contact with information each day. And I was really attached to it just for that reason, just as a consumer of content. And then it was also a place where I genuinely wanted to communicate with people and react to things. And I would see some article that I thought was great, and I would signal boost it to the people following me on Twitter. And that was rewarding, and I could literally help people on Twitter. I mean, there are people who have raised lots of money for on Twitter just by signal boosting their GoFundMe's. And so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive. But I was always worried that it was producing needless conflict for me and was giving me a signal in my life that I was being lured into responding to and taking seriously that was out of proportion to its representation of any opinion or set of opinions that I should be taking seriously. So I was noticing that-- and again, this evolved over years, I mean, this long predated recent changes to Twitter, but I was noticing that many of the worst things that had happened for me professionally were first born on Twitter. I mean, just like some conflict I got into with somebody, or something that I felt like I needed to podcast about in response to on Twitter. Just so much of it, either it's genesis was Twitter, or it's the further spin of it that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional happened on Twitter. It was just-- Twitter was part of the story when it got really bad. And I've had vacations that have gone sideways just because I got on Twitter and said something, and then I had produced a controversy that I had to respond to, and then I had to do a podcast about that. And it was just, this is a mess. And so at that point, I have friends who also had big Twitter platforms who would say why are you responding to anything on Twitter? Just tweet and ghost. Joe Rogan-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, post and ghost. SAM HARRIS: sat me down and tried to give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher. And both of them engage Twitter in that way. I mean, I think they basically never look at their ad mentions. They never see whats coming back at them. They use it effectively, the way I use, or don't even, use Instagram or Facebook. I mean, I don't even see what's going out there in my name. And so I could essentially do that for myself on Twitter, presumably. And I did that for some periods of time, but then I would continually decide, OK, now it's all balanced again, maybe I can just communicate here because it was very tempting for me to communicate with people because I would see somebody clearly misunderstanding something I had said on my podcast, and I think, why not clarify this misunderstanding? And my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a-- sometimes it was a meandering process of discovery. But often, it was just a stark confrontation with what appeared to me to be just lunacy and malevolence on a scale that I'd never encounter elsewhere in my life. I'd never meet these people in life, and yet I was meeting these people by the tens of thousands on Twitter. And so the thing that began to worry me about it-- and again, I understand that people have the opposite experience. I mean, depending on what you're putting out and the kinds of topics you're touching, you could have just nothing but love coming back at you on Twitter. But because I am very-- essentially, in the center, politically, and because this is now on my podcast, this is not in the Waking Up app. I'm often criticizing the far left and criticizing the far right. I'm basically pissing off everyone some of the time. It's different, if you're only criticizing the left, no doubt you get hate from the left, but you have all the people on the right who just reflexively and tribally are expressing their solidarity for you, and who are dunking on your enemies for you and when your enemies come out of the woodwork. And if you're only criticizing the right, you get a lot of pain from the right, but you've got the people on the left who are tribally identified with the left, who are just going to reflexively defend you. If you're in the center criticizing the left as hard as anyone on the right ever criticizes the left, and you're also criticizing the right as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right, you're getting hate from both sides all the time, and no one is reflexively and tribally defending you because you pissed them off last time. You might be getting hate from the left now, and the people on the right agree with you but they can't forget the thing you said about Trump on that podcast two podcasts ago, so they're not going to defend you. And so I basically created hell for myself on Twitter because it was just a theater of-- it was just pure cacophony most of the time. And what I was seeing was-- I mean, there's no way there's this many psychopaths in the world, but I was seeing psychopaths everywhere. I was seeing the most malicious dishonesty, and just goalpost moving, and hypocrisy. I mean, some of it's trolling, and some of it's real confusion, and some of it is psychopathy, but it's like, it was so dark that I worried that it was actually giving me a very negative and sticky view of humanity that was-- I mean, one, I think it is inaccurate, but two, it was something that I was returning to so much because, again, I was checking Twitter at least a dozen times a day, and I'm sure there were some days where I checked it 100 times a day. I mean, it was, again, it was my main source of information. I was constantly reading articles and then putting my own stuff out. That it became this kind of fun house mirror in which I was looking at the most grotesque side of humanity and feeling implicated in ways that were important because it was reputationally important, or seem to be important. I know a lot of these people. These weren't just faceless trolls, these are people with whom I have had relationships and in some cases friendships, who because of what, largely, Trump and COVID did to our political landscape in the last half a dozen years, we're beginning to act in ways that seemed starkly dishonest and crazy making to me. So I was just noticing that I was forming a view of people who I actually have had dinner with that was way more negative, based on their Twitter behavior, then I think would ever be justified by any way they would behave in life with me. I mean, I was never going to have a face-to-face encounter with any of these people that was this malicious, and dishonest, and gaslighting, and weird as what was happening hourly on Twitter. And so I just began to become more sensitive to what this was-- just the residue of all of this in my life, and just how often the worst thing about me in my relationship with the people in my life, like just talking to my wife or my kids, was just the fact that I had been on Twitter at some point in the previous hour. And there was some residue of that in my interaction with them. It's like, what are you stressed out about? What are you annoyed about? What are you pissed off about? What can't you get out of your head? What is the thing that you now feel like you need to spend the next week of your life focused on because it went so sideways for you? All of that was Twitter. I mean, literally 100% of that was Twitter. And so I just, at one point, it was actually on Thanksgiving day, I just looked at this and I just-- I mean, there was very little thought went into it. I mean, literally, there was more thought involved in whether I wanted coffee when you asked me when I showed up here. I mean it was just like, at a certain point I just I just saw it, and I just ripped the Band-Aid off. And to answer your other question, it's been almost wholly positive, as you might expect given the litany of pain and discomfort I just ran through. But I mean, it's surprising to recognize how much of a presence it was in my life given the sense of what is now missing. I mean, there's no question there's an addictive component to it. And when you see-- I mean, like when I look at what Elon is doing on Twitter, forget about his ownership of it-- I've got a lot to say about the choices he's making for the platform, but just his personal use of it is just so obviously an expression of-- I mean, I don't know if addiction is the clinically appropriate term, but his dysfunctional attachment to using the platform. Again, forget about changing it and owning it, but just the degree to which it is pointlessly disrupting the life of one of the most productive people in any generation. That was also instructive to me because I know Elon, and from a friend's eye view of the situation, it's so obviously not good for him that he's spending this much time on Twitter. I just brought that back to me. It's like, well, if it's not-- if this is what it's doing to Elon, and he's got all these other things he could be doing with his attention, how much of my use of Twitter is actually a good idea and optimize to my well-being and the well-being of the people around me? So anyway, there was an addictive component to it I think, and so when that got stripped off, I do notice that there's-- I mean, there are times I pick up my phone and I realize this is like the old me picking it up my phone for a reason that no longer exists because there's not that much-- I have a Slack channel with my team, and I've got email, obviously, but it's like, that is not much of what I was doing with my phone really in the end. And so it's just my phone is much less of a presence in my life. And so it's almost wholly good, but yeah, I think there is some danger in-- or some possible danger in losing touch with certain aspects of culture, which, again, I'm not even sure-- I mean, there's this question of how much is Twitter real life, and how much is it just a mass delusion? I don't know. But insofar as it actually matters what happens on Twitter, or insofar as I was actually getting a news diet which I'm not going to be able to recapitulate for myself, or I'm just not in fact going to recapitulate for myself even if I could, if any of that matters, I haven't discovered that yet. I mean, it was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth and it's impressive. I think I said, it was like I amputated a phantom limb. It was not a real limb, but it was this continuous presence in my life that-- it's weird, it actually relates to the concept of self in surprising ways because I felt there was a part of myself that existed on Twitter. And I just performed a suicide of that self. This is ending right now, there's no residue, there's nothing to go back and check, it's gone. And I didn't go back and look at my-- what's interesting to consider is that I'd been on Twitter for 12 years. I don't keep a journal. I mean, Twitter, in my timeline would have been a kind of journal. I could have gone back to a specific hour and a specific day and looked at what I was paying attention to. I mean, that could have been an interesting record of just who I've been for a decade, and probably a pretty humbling record of who I've been for a decade in terms of the kinds of things that captivated my attention. I didn't even think to go nostalgically just look at any of that, or see if any of it was worth saving, or archiving, or thinking-- I just-- delete. And so my actual sense of who I am and my engagement with my audience, the world of people who could potentially know me. What does it mean to have a platform? Where do I exist, digitally? My sense of all of that got truncated in a way that is much less noisy. I mean, it's amazing how much can't get fucked up now in my life. It's like with Twitter, almost anything could happen. The next tweet was always an opportunity to massively complicate my life. There is no analogous space for me now. And so it's what I'm going to say on your podcast, what I'm going to say on my own podcast, what I'm going to write next. That's much more deliberative and the opportunities to take my foot out of my mouth or to reconsider whether any of this is worth it. Is this the Hill I really want to die on now. It can be much more considered. I mean, I think all of that's to the good. But even more important than that is there's not-- I'm not getting this continuous signal that is always inviting a response, whether on Twitter, or on my own podcast, or anywhere else. And it's just much less noisy. I mean, life is much less noisy and cluttered. And that definitely feels better. That's 100% better. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm happy to hear that. I know a number of people miss you there, but you sound happy. I sense the genuine happiness. And several things come to mind-- first of all, thank you for sharing your rationale there and how it went. I think for a lot of people they think, oh, you must have walked around in circles for hours talking about whether it was delete, as many good decisions are executed. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport's work, deep work. In many ways, Cal's-- I've never met him, but we know each other through the internet space. He's really ahead of his time with this notion of deep work and limiting distractions. I think he's even got a book about a world without email or something, really extreme. SAM HARRIS: So I mean, he deserves some credit because he had been somewhat a proximate cause to this. He had been on my podcast, and he had encouraged me to delete Twitter because I had been I had been reaching some kind of crisis point with it prior to that podcast and so we talked about it. And I had recorded that podcast but hadn't released it. I actually recorded the podcast the day before I wound up deleting Twitter, but I hadn't yet released it. So in my podcast with him, in the intro to it, I then give a post-mortem on my deleting it. But he was one of the last people who was in my head around these issues. And actually, it was not by accident I had invited him on the podcast because I increasingly wanted to think about whether this was totally dysfunctional. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm a big fan of Cal Newport. And I am on social media. I'm on Twitter. I had some high-friction interactions there, and I have a process for dealing with those. I tend to avoid high-friction confrontations online. But Instagram is a much friendlier place by the way. If you want to come over to where the nice kids-- the cool kids actually hang out-- SAM HARRIS: Strangely, I'm not looking for a substitute. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Don't let me entice you over there. But I think that this notion of really being able to access what Cal calls deep work, what Rick Rubin talks about being able to touch the source of great creativity and focus on a regular basis, does require that one have certain types of, and in some cases, zero interaction with certain platforms. That merely being on a platform and blocking people that just won't provide. I think a lot of energy opens up. And I'm fascinated by this concept of energy. I mean, we only have so much energy, neural energy, to devote. And in many ways what you described, there's really I think striking parallels to what we've been talking about all along these last hours, which is that sometimes the thing that feels so powerful, that has such a gravitational pull, and that we think this is experience, this is life, this is just the way it is, actually is an illusion. And when you step away from it, you realize that there's this whole other dimension of interactions that was available all along but that we, for whatever reason, were intervening in by way of our reflexive, distracted behavior. So I think there's a poetry there. SAM HARRIS: I was a hard case, but yeah, I got religion on this point, and it's a good change. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, Sam, I want to say a couple of things-- first of all, every time you talk I learn so much, and that's in the dimensions of neuroscience, even hard core neural circuitry type stuff, which is my home. When you talk about philosophy, or meditation, or psychedelics, and even politics, a topic that I'm woefully undereducated in, but you have this amazing ability to blend and synergize across things. And I think, today, what occurs to me is that not only is that no accident because of your training, and the rigor, and the depth at which you've explored these different topics, but also your openness to it. But I think, at least for me, above all it's because I think you are able to encapsulate this idea of the self and the different ways in which we each and all can potentially interact with the environment and our inner landscape. Your description of meditation, I have to say, now has forever changed the way I think about meditation. I would no longer just think of it as a perceptual exercise. On the podcast, I've been talking about it as something to do for these various benefits, the benefit set of more focus, lower stress, of which certainly exists. But what you describe today, has such an allure and holds such a promise that, as I mentioned, I'm certainly going to change my behavior. And I know I'm speaking on behalf of many, many people, when I just want to extend my thanks for your coming here today to teach us even more because, of course, you have your podcast and the app, the Waking Up app. And the fact that, regardless of the political landscapes, regardless of what neuroscience feels about psychedelics, or where things are at any point in time, you strike me as somebody who is very committed to sharing knowledge and thoughtful deep discourse so that people can benefit. And there are very few people like you. In fact, there's probably only just one. And so I feel very grateful to be sitting across the table from him for these last hours. SAM HARRIS: Oh, nice, nice. Well, I really enjoyed this, and I want to congratulate you on what you've built here because your podcast is everywhere, and I'm a fan. And even more than that, I'm continually seeing the evidence of you reaching people and benefiting people, and this is one of the best examples of new media just carving out a space that people didn't really know existed because this is not television, it's not radio, it's not-- and all of a sudden, people have time to hear a conversation of great length that goes into nitty gritty scientific detail on hormones. I mean, who would have thought that was even possible? And so, yeah, I would just-- congratulations, it's fantastic to see. And I'm just very happy for the opportunity to talk to you and your people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank you, it's very gratifying to hear. And I feel very blessed, in no small part because of our conversation today. Thank you so much. SAM HARRIS: Nice, well, to be continued. ANDREW HUBERMAN: To be continued. We'll do it again, and again, and again. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Sam Harris.

Title: Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others | Huberman Lab Podcast 104
Published: 2022-12-26 13:00:27 UTC
Description:
My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity.  And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’ as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.

Title: The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation | Huberman Lab Podcast 103
Published: 2022-12-19 13:00:17 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.

Title: Dr. Kyle Gillett: Tools for Hormone Optimization in Males | Huberman Lab Podcast 102
Published: 2022-12-12 13:00:10 UTC
Description:
My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillett. Dr. Kyle Gillett is a dual board certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in hormone optimization. He is an M.D-- that is, a medical doctor-- and he treats patients with a variety of backgrounds, ages and goals. Today, we discuss male hormone optimization. We discuss behavioral tools, nutrition-based tools, supplement-based tools, prescription-drug-based tools, and their interactions in determining overall levels of testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrogen, growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and many other hormones that impact mood, libido, well-being, strength, cognition, and various psychological factors. We've covered hormone optimization in both men and women in previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast, but today's discussion is different. Dr. Kyle Gillett offers very specific recommendations for people with different goals and of different ages. And we get deep into the weeds of, for instance, how does one know whether or not their testosterone is optimized or not, how often to test for specific hormones such as testosterone and other hormones, and really, how to gauge how good one should feel? This is something that's often overlooked in discussions about hormone optimization or health optimization of any kind, for that matter. For instance, people will talk about reduced libido and discuss whether or not testosterone levels are to blame, but how does one calibrate their libido in the first place? That is, how does one know whether or not their libido is normal, too low, or too high? We also discuss, for instance, whether or not hormone optimization should be pursued continually throughout the year-- for instance, whether or not you should cycle on and off supplements and/or prescription drugs geared towards hormone optimization. And we discuss the behavioral foundations of optimal hormone function. These are things that every male should be doing and various things they should actively avoid if their goal is to have healthy hormones and to, quote, unquote, optimize their levels of every hormone from growth hormone to testosterone at any stage of life. And while today's discussion is about male hormone optimization, I want to emphasize that we discuss all the various ages for male hormone optimization. So for those of you that are parents, for those of you that are young, those of you that are middle aged, or old, or teenagers, we explore adolescent, puberty, teen and late teens, early adulthood, adulthood, and into the late geriatric ages. So regardless of your age and whether or not you are male or female, today's episode ought to be of interest to you. I should also point out that we will soon also be hosting an expert guest on female hormone optimization. One thing that I'm certain people of all ages and biological sex will enjoy about today's conversation is that we also get into descriptions of how psychology and life events impact hormones and how hormones impact our psychology and the way that we show up to various life events. So today is really a broad overview that goes all the way down to fine details about male hormone optimization. And I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you will have an immense amount of new information about how this endocrine-- that is, hormone system in your body works-- and how it interacts with your brain and other tissues and many, many actionable tools that you can pursue regardless of stage of life. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the word nootropics, because it means smart drugs, and frankly, there are no specific neural circuits in the brain or body for being, quote, unquote, smart. Thesis understands this, and they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and body into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish. They use the highest quality ingredients-- things like phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC, many ingredients that I've talked about before on this podcast and that I happen to use myself. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a game changer. For me, I like their nootropic for clarity. I used that before cognitive work often. And I like their nootropic for energy, and I often used that before workouts, and in particular, workouts that are especially intense. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman, take their 3-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month. Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman, and use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off your first box. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 All-American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly, for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or off into the distance. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system, and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling, and indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face they're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, they also have a terrific aesthetic and they can be used just as well for wearing to work, or out to dinner, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to roka-- that's R-O-K-A-- .com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's roka-- R-O-K-A-- .com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress well over a year ago, and it's been the best sleep that I've ever had. One of the things that makes Helix mattresses so unique is that they match the design of the mattress to your unique sleep needs. So for instance, if you go on to their website. You can take a brief quiz. It only takes about two or three minutes, and you'll answer questions like do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night, or whether or not you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach, or maybe you don't know. Regardless, they will match you to the custom mattress that ideal for your sleep needs. For me, that was the dusk-- D-U-S-K-- mattress which, for me, was not too firm, not too soft, and was ideal for my sleep patterns. You take the quiz and you'll find out what mattress is ideal for your sleep patterns. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their brief sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress, and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. They have a 10 year warranty, and you get to try out the mattress for 100 nights risk-free. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. To find the supplements we discuss on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S-- livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now, for my discussion with Dr. Kyle Gillett. Dr. Gillett, great to have you back. KYLE GILLETT: Great to be back. Thank you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to begin with a question about one of the most mysterious and important phases of life, which is puberty. I've long wondered whether or not how quickly somebody goes into puberty-- so at what age-- and how long puberty takes-- so how brief or protracted that puberty is for them to acquire the so-called secondary sexual characteristics, things like hair growth on the face for males and changes in bone, and muscle density, and growth, et cetera. When I was in middle school and high school, I noticed that some people transitioned into all that very fast and some people took a long time to acquire those characteristics. Can we learn anything about ourselves, our hormones, and maybe even how long we're going to live based on the time in which we enter puberty and how long it takes us to progress through puberty? And I guess that also raises the question, does puberty ever truly end? KYLE GILLETT: There are many takeaways from puberty. Some of the actionable items from it are, yes, it can and does affect your adult height and also stature and also body composition. So puberty is a time-- and if we're talking specifically about males, think of it as a time where, if you have obesity as a child, you could potentially use that time to change your lifestyle and habits and reset things, and it is a bit easier. It's almost like a free injection of testosterone and metabolism and drive and effort into your life. There is a wide variation in how quickly puberty goes through. So there are stages called Tanner stages, which we don't necessarily need to get into. But if you enter puberty very early, then it can decrease your adult height or stature. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for a given male that enters puberty at 13 versus a male that enters puberty at 15, can we say that the guy that entered puberty at 13 is going to be shorter than the guy that entered puberty at 15, or it's not quite that straightforward? KYLE GILLETT: If they are identical twins and the individual who entered puberty at age 13 also finished puberty, went all the way through the Tanner stages-- and if you do a bone scan, which I believe is usually done on the left wrist, and it says yes, your growth plates are mostly closed, you're not going to grow more than a couple inches of height after that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just a related question. When I was growing up, it was thought, or at least people would say, that resistance training-- in particular, lifting heavy weights could stunt one's growth. Is that true or false? KYLE GILLETT: It is false when you're talking about just lifting heavy weights. Dirty bulking certainly has the potential to stunt one's growth for two main mechanisms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you define dirty bulking? KYLE GILLETT: [CHUCKLES] So dirty bulking is eating an excess of calories not just to acquire lean metabolically active body mass or get stronger, but purposely acquiring body fat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So purposely acquiring muscle and fat by overeating and lifting weights can stunt one's growth. Do I have that correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. So it does two things. If you're doing it as a very young child, it can-- that fat can become leptin resistant and it can produce more leptin, and that leptin can activate the hypothalamus, which activates the pituitary, which releases gonadotropin, which basically just increase testosterone and estrogen earlier than it otherwise would have. It's the same mechanism behind why childhood obesity causes early puberty. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. I do remember a paper published in Science Magazine-- I believe it was focused mainly on females, but showing that when enough body fat accumulates, the hormone leptin is secreted, and that triggers the onset of puberty. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given the increase in childhood obesity that we're observing now, are we seeing an earlier onset of puberty in males and females? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, in both males and females. Not to get too technical, but there's a G protein-coupled receptor on the hypothalamus and leptin directly binds it, so it does appear directly cause causatory and not just correlation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And if I understand correctly, what you're saying is for a young guy-- let's say, 13, 14-- who wants to really bulk up and deliberately-- deliberately, excuse me-- overeats, and is doing their squats, and deadlifts, and bench presses and really trying to get big, they will get big, but only in the lateral dimension. They're effectively limiting their total height and it can shut down the long bone growth of their limbs. Is that correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. The growth of the long bones is mostly related to the estradiol alpha receptor, so basically, one of the receptors for estrogen, which can be secondary to early puberty and also is related to body fat because you have that conversion of testosterone to estrogen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So can we assume that if a young male wants to get into resistance training that bodyweight exercises are probably OK and maybe even some weight training, kettlebells, et cetera, but that they should avoid doing so-called dirty bulking-- trying to deliberately gain weight-- up until what age? Until puberty is over? KYLE GILLETT: I would say an individual should limit the amount of abnormal body fat accumulation, or dirty bulking, indefinitely throughout their entire life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So again, if I understand correctly, that recommendation to avoid deliberate weight gain or rapid weight gain is not just to allow an individual to reach their maximum height, but also to avoid laying down a lot of body fat cells. Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. The balance between that is, when you are going through puberty, you are able to add a lot of lean body mass-- not just muscle mass, but bone mass and other mass as well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I started lifting weights when I was 16, and I confess I trained pretty heavy at times. I don't know whether or not I would have been taller than I am now, but when I started that training, I had already reached what was at least close to my predicted height. I can't say that I deliberately waited until I had grown. It just so happened that I stumbled into the weight room and found that I liked it at age 16, at which point, I was already the height that I am now. So in any case, what I'm hearing is that laying down a lot of excess body fat is not a good idea. What if somebody grows up chubby or fat for whatever reason-- reasons related to the eating patterns in their family, maybe even some genetic reasons. Is it safe and/or wise for a young person-- so let's say somebody who's around the age of puberty, or even younger, or in their late teens-- to be dieting and actively trying to lose body fat. Is that safe? KYLE GILLETT: Under the supervision of a physician, it is certainly safe to change your body composition. In pediatric obesity medicine, you're often talking about a recomposition or a renormalization of the growth curve compared to peers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Thank you. So as you may have sensed, we started chronologically with puberty, and I know that there's another puberty that even precedes the puberty that we're all familiar with. Maybe-- if you want to just briefly mention that because I was talking with you about this before we started. The puberty that I'm most familiar with, and I think most people are most familiar with, the acquisition of deepening of the voice, growth of muscle and bone, body hair, acquisition of libido and things like that. That's actually the second puberty that we all go through. Maybe would just mention for us and educate us on the first puberty. I think most people will be hearing this for the very first time. KYLE GILLETT: The first puberty of everyone's life is the first three months of their life. You may notice that your baby has more acne the first three months and that they also have, in general, just more changes related to androgens and estrogens, perhaps oilier skin, even more genitourinary-- genital growth during the first three months. And this is mostly due to DHEA, which is an adrenal hormone. The second puberty, or the puberty that most people know of, actually starts that same way as well. It's called adrenarche, and it's when the adrenals kick in, I guess, for the second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there a standard age or age range in which the testicles descend in males? KYLE GILLETT: Usually before birth. It is not uncommon to have one or even two undescended testes, but there is a risk of testicular cancer, especially if they are not fixed early and also heat damage to the teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank you for that coverage of the two puberties. So early in life. I imagine some of our listeners probably still in one or the-- well, one or the other puberty. The ones that are in the first puberty, obviously, aren't aware that they're listening to this podcast, but maybe it'll be embedded in their subconscious. But some listeners probably are still in puberty. But I think everyone can remember back to their puberty, and roughly when they first entered puberty, and how quickly they aggregated the secondary sex characteristics. I'd like to turn now to a general question about what all males ought to do in order to optimize their hormones. So if you could just list off the things that all males should do on a daily basis, weekly basis. I mean, should guys in their teens and 20s be getting their bloodwork done, should they be taking supplements? We already talked about weight training. What should they be doing and what should they avoid doing if the goal is to have a long arc of healthy hormone optimization throughout the lifespan? KYLE GILLETT: There's many things that you should do. An analogy that I often make is when there's a brand new car that comes off the assembly line, you do a full scope of diagnostic workup-- hook it up to the computer. And I think we should do the same thing with humans as well. During puberty, obviously, you're a functioning human, but I would say there's still development. And I think that the human always develops. I don't think development ever ends, but you want to monitor that progress across a person's lifespan. [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry. So for bloodwork-- I mean, what would be the earliest-- let me put it this way. If blood work didn't cost anything and everyone could get it, when would you want to see everybody get their bloodwork done for the first time? Obviously, individuals under the age of 18 should talk with their parents about this. And as long as the parents and the child agree and the parents are on board with this as well, you can start getting bloodwork. Often, a child will come in with complaints of either precocious puberty or delayed puberty, and this individual might be 9 or this individual might be 15. For a healthy child, when they're going through their later Tanner stages-- which is 4 and 5, so they've developed several secondary sexual characteristics-- they might have hair growth or starting to notice more beard growth. That's a good time to do it. If you're concerned with stature or heighth, or if you're not tracking along where most members of your family have-- not just their height and stature, but also the timing of their puberty, then that's time to get labs. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I could travel back in time, I would have gotten my bloodwork done for hormones, and lipids, and everything else at 18. I, unfortunately, didn't know where and how to get that, and I didn't have any pressing clinical issues. And so I think the first time that I got my bloodwork done, I was in my late 20s, maybe even in my early 30s. And I'm still dying to know what my bloodwork was when, for instance, I was 17 and I felt a certain way. And I confess that in many dimensions, I actually feel better now at-- I'll be 47 soon-- at 47 than I did in my teens and 20s. And I think it was more on the psychological side. I think that-- but in terms of just understanding why we felt great or why we felt or feel terrible or not so great, I think bloodwork is extremely informative. What do you think are the key things to look for in bloodwork? I mean, testosterone is always the topic that comes up in the context of male hormone optimisation, but certainly there are a lot of other hormones that are important as well. KYLE GILLETT: And with testosterone, you want to get either testosterone and an SHBG or a free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you define SHBG for our listeners, please? KYLE GILLETT: It is Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. It is the protein that binds up all androgens and estrogen in the body. So the stronger the androgen, the stronger it binds. During puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT which is the strongest bioidentical androgen, has a huge role-- a prominent role in secondary sexual characteristics. And if your SHBG is very high, then your DHT can run higher because it's not metabolized, but there's not quite as much free DHT. So you want to balance between a high enough free DHT and a high enough total DHT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And obviously, these blood tests are going to have to be read and interpreted by a qualified physician. Most people aren't going to be in a position to evaluate them properly, or at least not with the full depth that they could if they had an M.D like yourself looking at them. So everyone should get bloodwork as early as possible depending on their budget and availability. What should everybody do in terms of monitoring those markers? So assuming that there's no major intervention, how often do you recommend that people get their bloodwork done? KYLE GILLETT: Let's say-- let's take an individual who just turned 18, they just got their first set of bloodwork. They'll probably find something in it that they may want to optimize using shared decision-making with their physician. Usually, a good follow-up is about six months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So twice a year, getting bloodwork done, and then having a physician evaluate it. That sounds reasonable to me. And for those that didn't initiate this at 18, such as myself, I guess the best time to start then would be as soon as possible. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In terms of the other things that all males should do, meaning all males of all ages-- puberty and beyond-- what are some of those things? So on a daily basis, maybe you could just take us through the arc of a day and push out some of the protocols that you use or the things that you like to see your male patients use in order to try and optimize their hormone status. KYLE GILLETT: I'll briefly touch on some of the lifestyle pillars to start. Diet and exercise are the first to. In puberty, sleep is particularly important, of course. But with diet and exercise, throughout a lifespan, you want to not exclude things that are helping you. For example, during puberty if you're consuming dairy, and then all of a sudden you cut out all dairy, dairy can help increase IGF-1 and free IGF-1. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And just, again, for our audience, maybe just mention what having enough IGF-1 can do for us that's beneficial is? KYLE GILLETT: It helps you grow. It helps with genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, and long bone growth-- skin growth, hair growth, a host of things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So getting an array of nutrients that include dairy. What other sorts of nutrients are important during development? KYLE GILLETT: You want to have adequate vitamin D. Vitamin D helps with testosterone production, it helps, again, with bone mineralization and stature. After an age of about 25-- and there's not a strict cutoff, but up to about an age of 25, optimizing your growth hormone and IGF-1 helps with bone density and bone growth. So from the dietary standpoint, you want to have enough free estrogen-- not too much when you're growing. But you want to help basically stockpile bone to prevent a risk of osteoporosis or thin bone fractures when you're older. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, as someone who broke his left foot 5 times while in high school, I can say that whatever young people can do to optimize their bone density would be great. That problem seems to have resolved itself over time, but I don't know. Back then, I did a short run as a vegetarian, but I've always been an omnivore. I realize that some of this relates to ethics, and food allergies, and things of that sort. But would you say that, on balance, most people would benefit from eating a combination of quality proteins from animal sources and non-animal sources-- fruits, vegetables, and starches? I mean, what do you think, for instance, about people following a pure carnivore or a very pure vegan diet in their 20s and 30s? KYLE GILLETT: In their late 20s, it might be a reasonable option. In early 20s and certainly teens, it is a horrible idea because it is likely to significantly decrease your free androgens. So you will have less testosterone acting on receptors through the body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are there any other micronutrients or macronutrients that people in their 20s and 30s should emphasize? KYLE GILLETT: We haven't really touched on fatty acids or fiber too much. Fiber is going to be paramount in kind of setting your set point of your gut microbiome the rest of your life. There is prebiotic fiber, which you can think of as fish food for your good gut microbiome. Your gut microbiome is kind of like an aquarium or a fish tank. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, I'm just thinking about goldfish swimming around in that-- the goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live or dead. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, but any fiber or food that you're putting in your gut, it's either going to skew your gut microbiome toward something that is more beneficial or more detrimental. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And would you say that the prebiotic fiber and getting essential fatty acids, that would be important to do throughout the lifespan or just for people in their 20s and 30s? KYLE GILLETT: Throughout the lifespan, particularly important in the teenage, '20s, '30s, because it helps with brain development. You're certainly more of an expert than me when it comes to brain development, but it does continue to develop, really, throughout the lifespan, but certainly through the 20s and 30s as well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about taking a multivitamin while you're growing up? So many people do that. Is it necessary, is it useful? And if it's not necessary, is it safe to do anyway? KYLE GILLETT: It's generally safe to do anyway. I do not think everybody needs a multivitamin. The more exclusionary your diet is-- for example, if you have celiac disease or if you're planning on fertility soon, then perhaps it's more reasonable to take a multivitamin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In a previous discussion of ours, I asked you about caloric restriction and testosterone. And if I recall correctly, the idea was that if somebody is overweight-- they have an excess fat, adipose tissue-- then getting rid of some of that adipose tissue through caloric restriction and exercise, provided it's done not too fast in a healthy way, is going to be beneficial for testosterone in the long-run. But that for individuals who are not carrying an excess of body fat, caloric restriction is actually going to lower testosterone. First of all, do I have that correct? And second, are there any addendums to that you'd like to give us now? KYLE GILLETT: That's correct. If you look at an individual in a caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One is that they'll have less building blocks for hormones. Another is that they will be in a catabolic state more often, so that balance of anabolism and catabolism will be different. They'll likely have less signaling from growth hormone and IGF-1, and they'll also have the high SHBG that we defined earlier as the binding protein, so their free androgens and free estrogens will go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. So we touched on sleep being critical. I would say throughout the lifespan, trying to get enough quality sleep at least 80% of the nights of your life, and the other 20% are just what happens when there's noise outside or you're stressed. It just-- you have an exam or you're having a great time for whatever reason. There are a lot of good reasons to lose some sleep now and again as well. So we have sleep, we've got nutrition. We touched on that. We'll get back into supplementation. Now, what are some of the other pillars of creating the proper environment for hormone optimization? KYLE GILLETT: Stress is probably the next one. During both puberty, but also the 20s and 30s, individuals are figuring out how they want to cope with stress and also figuring out what they want to choose to put their effort into. So if someone is overstressed, then it can have-- it can put all the other lifestyle pillars-- and then they stop dieting well, they stop exercising, and everything else can go askew. There is also some degree of social component to this, so perhaps I need to add a seventh pillar of social. During your 20s and 30s, you may be forming a family as well. Perhaps you have children, and the health of the family unit is going to be vitally important not only-- not necessarily directly for hormone optimisation, but it's going to throw everything else off if it's off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for people that are not starting their own families in their 20s and 30s, can that social connection be extended to friendships and work relationships as well? KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. In fact, if someone's not starting a family, it is just as concerning, but for other reasons. Each individual is going to have their close group of family and friends. And if someone does not have one of those connections, that's when things can potentially get bad not just for them individually, but also society. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So when you say stress, you mean learn to manage your stress. What does that look like? I mean, if a patient has high blood pressure, or even if they don't, you just sense that they're stressed. They have a lot of pressured speech, or they're not feeling well, or communicating that they're not doing well. What are some of the things that you recommend in order to try and ameliorate that stress? KYLE GILLETT: There's different mindfulness or relaxation techniques. Going outside can often help with this as well. Dietary changes and exercise can help with this too. Some people like prayer or meditation. And a lot of people like counseling or therapy, or even just talking openly with a family member or a friend. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What would it be some of the other pillars for hormone optimization? Here, I feel like we're not just talking about people in their 20s and 30s, but again, we're wrapping our arms around basically puberty onward. I mean, gosh, looking back, I started meditating pretty early, I started weight training and running early. I gave some thought to my diet in high school, but it really was in college that I started thinking more about what I was ingesting and why and trying to do better there. But people are coming to the table at different stages of life and trying to optimize for hormones. So what would be some of the additional things that everybody should do? KYLE GILLETT: Everyone should get outside and find a movement pastime to last a lifetime. You're going to get sunlight, you're going to get some degree of heat and cold exposure, and you're also just going to move more. Being in an artificial environment, where there's artificial lights artificial air conditioning, is going to have many effects on your body. So that's vital. Another one is finding what your purpose is in life. So I call this spirit, but it's really just the self-actualization component of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is basically your physical needs, your mental needs, and then your purpose in life-- what you really like to do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, picking some goal or target. And I always say that you don't have to stick to the same goal over time. Certainly, I haven't although I got started early in the science game and I'm still in it. The idea is not to pick the end goal, it is to pick a goal. And then once you reach that goal to assess, and then pick another goal, and so on. I think sometimes, when people hear about picking a purpose, they're like, oh, my goodness, I have to define-- sort of like naming oneself-- that you actually can change your goals and purpose over time. This is terrific. Would you suggest that people actively use or avoid supplementation prior to doing all these other things? I'm somebody that likes to throw the kitchen sink at things, but I also like to do things pretty systematically. So I would say behavior is first, then nutrition, then supplementation, and then maybe if, and only if, there's a real need-- and of course, working with a doctor-- prescription drugs. But there are probably people in their 20s or 30s-- maybe even in their 50s-- that aren't feeling great, and they want to do something in order to be able to train more or to feel more confident to seek out social connection. They just try and go about the whole business from the other side as well. What are your thoughts on that? KYLE GILLETT: I see supplements and medications as very similar-- one is prescribed and one is not. In general, medications have more side effects or potentially stronger therapeutic with more efficacy. But they are just tools to reach an end goal. So depending on the goal, if there's an individual that's an athlete, then certainly they should consider supplementation. Or if someone desires optimal or a very high level of cognitive performance, they should also consider supplementation. At the same time, food is medicine, and a lot of the benefits you can get in supplements, you can get in food as well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess it depends on how much time and energy you're willing to spend and also finances. I know that when I was in college, I could afford just a few supplements, and they were basically whey protein and some fish oil-- I was fortunate that I was pointed in the direction of those things-- and some creatine. I couldn't afford much else. Over time, of course, I could afford more. But it really does often depend on finances. Before we get into some specific recommendations to optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera, I want to ask you a question I've been wondering about for a long time. So often in the discussion about male hormone optimization, people will say, well, if your libido is suffering, you might want to be concerned about testosterone-- or even estrogen because we know that estrogen can impact libido as well. Sometimes, having estrogen too low is detrimental for libido. Or that people will say, you're not recovering from workouts or you're just you're feeling kind of depressed. The problem is, it's all subjective. [CHUCKLES] So how does one know whether or not their recovery from workouts, their energy, their confidence, their libido is within a healthy range? I mean, obviously, for people in a relationship they can know whether or not their libido matches the sort of cadence of the relationship and their partner. But how should people think about this and maybe then start to talk about it? Because one of the big differences, I think, between males and females is that, because females have a monthly cycle, they are familiar with the changes that occur in their hormones over time because every 28 days, those hormones are changing dramatically in ways that impact their physiology and psychology. But for males, I feel like there's a dearth of language to get into the more subtle aspects of this. It also has to do with privacy issues and people feeling like they don't want to overshare too much-- not knowing what's appropriate to share. But when you talk to a patient who's in their 30s, or maybe even their 70s or 60s-- it doesn't matter-- a male patient, what are you listening for? And I know you're not a psychiatrist, but what are your ears tuned to in order to try and figure out whether or not this person could really use some help with hormone optimization or whether or not something else-- or maybe they're just doing great and they don't realize it because they're placing demands on themselves that are excessive? KYLE GILLETT: You want to use a lot of open-ended questions. This process is called motivational interviewing. And your goal is to listen to the patient and not plant an idea in their mind that they can follow because everybody is going to have a different goal. Some people are better at reading their biofeedback or telling how they feel on a daily basis. There is screening questionnaires designed-- for example, an ADAM questionnaire to look at men's men's health and hormone-related health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's called ADAM questionnaire? KYLE GILLETT: ADAM questionnaire. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it available online that people could administer it to themselves. Although we don't want people making clinical diagnoses of themselves or anyone else, is it that sort of exam? KYLE GILLETT: It is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. KYLE GILLETT: I don't believe it is a clinically-validated tool like an ASCVD, which is like a risk of heart attack and stroke tool or many other tools. There's one for depression, there's one for anxiety. They're called PHQ9 and GAD7 respectively. But anyway, there is often an in-- the ADAM questionnaire-- and what you hear from the patient, if you are a very careful listener, is often different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can you give me an example of some of the questions on this ADAM questionnaire or the sorts of motivational interviewing that you might do? So let's say I'm your patient. I sit down. What sorts of questions would you ask to probe these kinds of dimensions of hormones? KYLE GILLETT: Questions about libido, questions about athletic performance, questions about motivation. And often, the patient will answer one thing, but what you hear from them subjectively is far different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Can you give me an example of a question? I'm happy to be the guinea pig here. KYLE GILLETT: A classic one is, a guy comes in-- and a lot of times, they say, oh, no, the wife made me go to the doctor. I go once a year, that's it. I don't want anything, I don't want any medications. Their screening questionnaires might be zeros across the board, so nothing. No issues. They're apparently in perfect health. They talk to you for a while, they get some rapport, they like you, and then right as you're finishing up the visit and about to go out the room, they mention that their libido isn't quite there, and they're having a little bit of ED as well, and perhaps they're even having some chest pressure or tightness. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. So right as you're leaving the room, a patient will tell you that they're having some sexual side effects-- or not side effects. They're having some sexual challenges, and then they'll mention chest pressure. Is the chest pressure a general decoy for, it's got to be my heart, or is it related to the other things that they're reporting? KYLE GILLETT: It can be related. In fact, erectile dysfunction is known as the canary in the coal mine. So coal miners would take the canary down, and it would-- the canary would die before the coal miners would of, I believe, carbon monoxide poisoning. And often, one of the causes of ED is plaque buildup, which can happen in the coronaries as well. But sometimes, they notice the symptom in the genitals before they do in the coronaries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for such a patient, let's say that patient was a young person where plaque buildup in the arteries and veins is not all that likely if they're, let's say, in their 20s or 30s, what would be your next step of the interview at that point, and what would you consider? Would you immediately order labs for that person to try and rule out any kind of actual hormone level deficiency? KYLE GILLETT: I certainly would order labs. There are some individuals that are very similar, and they come in, and they have the same symptoms, and one individual might have a very, very high testosterone, and one individual might be severely hypogonadal. So there's a big difference between the subjective and what the labs look like. So I certainly order labs. You also ask them about if it's situational or not, you ask them if they have ED if they're-- you ask them about their habits. You even ask about porn, and masturbation, and all these issues. And of course, that's between the doctor and the patient. And depending on what they tell you, you can often determine if there is a situational component-- some people call it psychogenic ED, but I don't love the term psychogenic ED, because it kind of puts some blame on the patient's mind. But a lot of the time, that is the case. There is even a test. And this is very rarely ordered, but it's called a nocturnal penile tumescence. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, is it true that there are periodic erections during sleep-- correct? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. So you basically put a cuff to see if you were having a normal sized erection during sleep. And I believe about 90% of the time they do that test, they are indeed having erections. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which would point to this psychogenic origin of whatever challenges they're having in terms of sexual interactions. You mentioned porn and masturbation. This topic has come up a bunch of times on this podcast and on other podcasts I've gone on because of the relationship between dopamine sexual motivation and sexual behavior. And I've been of the pretty strong stance that, while I'm not judging porn or masturbation, it can create a brain wiring situation where males in particular essentially teach their brain to be aroused by watching other people have sex as opposed to being the first person actor in sexual interactions. So in that sense, that's more about the brain wiring, and neuroplasticity, and dopamine. But what are your thoughts on porn and masturbation as they relate to hormones? I mean, this is a big debate on the internet. In fact, one of the most common debates is whether or not masturbation increases or decreases testosterone in males. Certainly, it will decrease motivation to go find sexual partners. We know this. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there are more and more data on this all the time. In terms of the effects of pornography and masturbation-- and here, I suppose we need to be somewhat specific and operationally define what we're talking about. We're talking about porn and masturbation to the point of ejaculation, because my understanding is that the ejaculation and orgasm associated with causes an increase in prolactin, which blunts libido for some period of time. The duration of that will vary from person to person and circumstance to circumstance. But basically, all of this points to the fact that porn and masturbation can really limit libido in the real world. And to me, pornography and the screen is not the real world. Although screens exist in the real world, the real world doesn't exist in the screen. KYLE GILLETT: That's an accurate statement, and prolactin does have a significant acute increase after ejaculation. It does to some degree after orgasm as well, but prolactin acts on the pituitary to inhibit the release of the hormones LH and FSH, of which LH can increase testosterone. So this may be one of the cases where the dose makes the poison. And if it is a very frequent habit, certainly daily or more than once a day would be very detrimental from a hormonal component not even taking into account the neural wiring. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Listen, I think it's terrific that you've actually defined frequency, because this is the problem on the internet or even in the doctor's office. You'll see descriptions about pornography being dangerous for certain things or detrimental to hormones. People say frequent, but what's frequent? So you're saying daily or multiple times per day would be potentially detrimental to the hormone profile of a male of essentially any age. KYLE GILLETT: And that's just for masturbation. With pornography-- with porn use as well, it would likely be worse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And why is that? Just the sort of dopaminergic drive of the stimulus-- just the really intense visual stimulus? KYLE GILLETT: Dopamine sensitivity. I think that using the analogy of a dopamine wave pool, it would deepen the pool, but not increase your supply of dopamine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe you could describe the dopamine wave pool because I think it's such a powerful way of thinking about dopamine and what dopamine does. In fact, I've always credited you when I've done it, but I've generally stolen your analogy of the dopamine wave pool because it's so astute. KYLE GILLETT: The dopamine wave pool describes the natural variation of ups and downs in your dopamine or your motivation. And in the wave pool, depending on how high the peak is, you often have a deeper trough. So you do not want to high of a peak. In addition, if your peak is very, very high-- for example, when you're using many substances like cocaine or like amphetamines, your dopamine can go so high that you lose almost all the water from the wave pool, and then when you crash from that, not only is the trough low, you have less dopamine in the pool to begin with. The dopamine receptor is extremely sensitive, as is the Gaba receptor, which is an inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine is technically a stimulant more related to adrenaline and noradrenaline. The depth of the pool can change very quick. So you want to have that happy medium where you're fairly near the top, but you're not so near the top that the depth of the pool is going to go down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I interpret that in the context of this discussion about libido, sex, porn, and masturbation, if somebody has a very intense sexual experience-- and here, we're not necessarily talking about an intense orgasm-- we're talking about just a lot of intense visual, so very-- a lot of intense imagery, or auditory input, or both-- that is going to lead to a situation where dopamine is going to be depleted afterwards. A guest on this podcast before-- my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke, who's an expert in addiction, talked a bit about this-- the sort of seesawing. Like, here, we're talking about a wave and a crashing out of the water from the wave pool. There, it was a seesawing from pleasure and pain. There's going to be a longer and deeper period of lack of pleasure following that. And I think a lot of people think, oh, well, that's great. They want the intense experience. But if that intense experience is coming from pornography and masturbation-- or I suppose coming from high adrenaline activities, like life-risking parkour hanging off the side of a building-- it inevitably is going to lead to depressive episodes, low libido episodes that follow. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct-- in a similar physiologic way to withdrawal from stimulants, like amphetamines. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, is sex with a partner different? Because there are many people who are chasing more and more intense experiences with a partner as opposed to through pornography and masturbation. Again, here, we're talking about all ages. And I should always say, anytime we're talking about sex with a partner, we're talking-- the four conditions that I always lay out on the Huberman Lab podcast are that we're talking about consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate interactions. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, and this is also a case where the dose makes the poison. So if there's-- obviously, meeting all those criteria, if they have one preference that, for both of them, is a positive experience, then that is likely OK. You're not going to be able to maintain dopamine over a certain threshold for a long period of time, so there very well may be a crash from that experience as well. And that crash may be different in one partner than the other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. So I'll draw an analogy to food. It would be like you don't have to serve the banquet meal seven nights of the week, maybe just two. Is that right? And there are other delicious foods out there? Can-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we use that analogy? KYLE GILLETT: --that is very reasonable. I'm not trying to be PG-13. I'm just trying to parsimony Occam's razor the ability to describe a lot of things in a few words. I'd like to return to the key things that people should do-- or I should say, the key things that men should do to optimize their hormones. So we talked about getting some movement, getting some sunlight, getting quality social connection one way or the other, avoid excessively frequent masturbation and viewing pornography. And for some people, zero might be the optimal number. And I keep coming back to this-- KYLE GILLETT: For most people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --for most people. Interesting. I feel so fortunate to have grown up prior to the availability of internet pornography. I've never been a big consumer of pornography. It's just not been my thing, but I hear so often from males of all ages about their addiction to it, their affliction by it. It's really a serious issue, and that's one of the reasons why I'm grateful that you're willing to talk about this and your clinical experience with these patients. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Green since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2. In terms of exercise, here's-- again, it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great to get exercise, but I'm familiar with-- if I train an hour a day-- 10 minutes of warm-up in 50 minutes to an hour of weight training or 50 minutes to an hour of cardio, I feel great, especially if, once a week, I take a complete day off. That's sort of my general schedule. I'm also familiar with when I go out for runs that are excessively long-- two hour runs or I spend 90 minutes in the gym to frequently, I start to feel like garbage. Everything suffers. My sleep starts to suffer. It doesn't matter how much I eat-- I don't seem to recover. I don't feel well. So I realize that recovery ability varies between individuals, but what do you think is a healthy, sustainable exercise regimen that anyone can follow that will also support their hormone status? KYLE GILLETT: For really vigorous exercise, around three to four times a week is very sustainable over a long period of time. On top of that, you could add in 3 or four more instances of less vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for less vigorous, would you mean zone two cardio where you can hold a conversation, but beyond which you can't? And for more vigorous you're thinking weight training or high intensity interval type training? Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. You can also weight train and have some benefit even at a low to moderate intensity. If you think about weight training where you have-- and it's not necessarily related to the incidence of DOMS, which is Delayed Onset Muscle soreness. But if you weight train lazy or easy from time to time-- obviously, you want to weight train very heavy from time to time as well because of more lean body mass growth. But if you weight train lighter, you're going to be able to do it more often, and it can still help with the hypertrophy of collagen-- for example, in tendons and ligaments. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So here, again, I'd like to perhaps drill into this notion of intensity and light weights because for me, some of the most brutal workouts I've ever done were in what I would consider a high repetition range-- 15 to 50. Actually, I went up to Oregon to watch the International Track and Field Championships. We went by to Cameron Haynes's place-- the Cameron Haynes-- and he and his trainer put us through a workout that was 25 to 50 repetitions per set, and it was done in circuit, and it was brutal. So it was light-- I mean, those weights were nothing. In some cases, it was body weight. But the number of repetitions was brutal. So when you say limiting intensity, are you talking about limiting the number of sets to failure, are you talking about really being kind of a lazy bear in the gym? I like to do that every once-- so a long rest, that sort of thing. What are your thoughts on that as it relates to hormone optimization? So I'll just mention-- and then I'll let you answer-- I feel best overall when I'm training for 10 minute warm-ups and about 45 or 50 minutes of weight training, where I'm pretty lazy between sets. Two to three minute rests, training somewhere in the 6 to 10 rep range, going to failure every once in a while, but mostly getting that sort of last rep before what I would think is failure. No forced reps, that kind of thing. And then jogging on the other days, nice and easy. When I do that, I feel fantastic in all other dimensions of life. When I train more intensely than that, even with lightweight, so faster cadence and lower rest, I feel like garbage. I get a headache, I'm kind of ornery, everything suffers. So what are your thoughts on defining a optimal exercise strategy for hormones. I've never measured my hormones in those two different contexts, but I have to imagine that it's cortisol related. KYLE GILLETT: When they study the effect of exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one area that's been studied is vigorous exercise-- episodes lasting longer than an hour. And they usually track it by a rating of perceived exertion, which isn't perfect, and it's not extremely actionable, but it's helpful for clinical science. But the takeaway from that is, basically, do not-- it is not hormonally helpful to train, especially regularly train, vigorously for longer than an hour. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm happy to hear that because it sounds like for most people, that hour of work is really the threshold. I think this is important for people to hear, especially males because I think with all of the incredible examples out there of people like Cam, like David Goggins, people who are training for very long periods of time-- and leaving aside all issues of what people are doing in order to optimize the recovery, I think an hour a day of exercise is just a great program that most anyone can follow. And beyond an hour, you start running into challenges. And the occasional 90-minute or two hour workout is no big deal. But if you start doing that more than once every two months, I think you're headed for trouble. Have you seen that in people's blood work and in their hormones? Do you ever see people that are just badly overtrained because they're just training too hard and too often? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. When the blood work is particularly bad, they're often in a large caloric deficit as well. There's a synergistic effect between a caloric deficit. Even if you're maintaining adequate protein intake, you might not be maintaining adequate iron intake or adequate vitamin D. And you're also just literally in a caloric deficit. Perhaps low carbs as well, very low free testosterone. And they're simultaneously doing a lot of vigorous exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. I often hear, and I'm starting to wonder whether or not, some of the quicker-to-results nutrition tactics-- things like dropping all carbohydrates, or the quicker-to-results exercise habits, like starting to do six day a week really intense workouts-- whether or not, in the short run, they work because they cause the cosmetic changes that people are seeking, but that they really undermine the overall goal, which is, at least to me, to have your hormones Maybe. not optimized to 100%, but to always be aiming for 100% and be close to it at every stage of life. KYLE GILLETT: Consistency is key here. If you are not consistent, then the law of diminishing returns certainly applies. So 80% or 90% of the benefit over many, many months is far better than 100%, but only half the time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. One thing that I found to be tremendously useful is to finish the workout while I still have energy, to not take myself to exhaustion. And then I'm able to talk about the dopamine wave pool. I'm able to sort of ride that into the rest of the day feeling great. I sort of save or bank some of the vigor from the training to bring it into my work. But then again, I'm not an athlete. I get paid to think and to speak, not to lift weights or to run. KYLE GILLETT: Another component of that is the balance between your sympathetic, which is your fight or flight nervous system, and your parasympathetic, which is your rest or digest nervous system. There is an anecdote, which is likely true, that many elite bodybuilders are very parasympathetic besides while they're lifting weights. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mean they're lazy and they like to eat a lot. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The lazy bear in the gym kind of phenomenon. KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely. But that being said, after a very, very vigorous workout-- for example, one where you're trained to failure, which bodybuilders and power lifters do all the time-- you feel the tiredness-- or you feel the strain from that heavy sympathetic activity when you are lifting a heavy weight, and it can potentially affect how you feel the rest of the day. So many people who have a job where that is highly cognitive do not like to have an extremely vigorous workout in the morning, which is when a lot of people are able to exercise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I exercise early in the morning-- that is, before 9:00 AM-- I have more energy all day long. If I do it mid-morning, I have experienced more of an afternoon crash. There's probably some circadian biology in there. I also noticed-- and I've actually seen in my bloodwork-- that if I don't get out for a 45-minute jog at least once a week, all of my blood profiles suffer in a direction that I don't want them to go. In particular, testosterone and estrogen move in directions that are not conducive to my goals. I'd like to talk about some of the approaches that people can use in order to optimize hormones. And these days, for better or for worse-- I think for worse-- younger guys are asking about and using testosterone replacement therapy-- so-called TRT. And I just want to frame this up by saying there is no strict cutoff for what is TRT. There are plenty of people whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are within the normal reference range and decide to start doing these things. Of course, they can limit fertility. There are a bunch of issues even at non, quote, unquote, steroidal performance enhancing dosages. I'd love to frame this up by first defining our terms, because one of the challenges on the internet is people talk about TRT, then they'll talk about performance enhancing drugs, they'll talk about steroids. They're all steroids. I mean, testosterone, estrogen are both steroid hormones. But what one considers replacement therapy versus what one considers performance enhancing is going to depend. So here's my question. Why in the world-- [EMPHASIS] why in the world-- would any male in his teens or twenties, or even 30s, whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are at the appropriate levels, meaning within the normal reference range, take exogenous testosterone given all the negative effects on fertility, some of the challenges that it can present if the dosages aren't quite right, et cetera. Why would they do that, certainly if they are not being paid for a particular endeavor, like they're not making money? If they are playing a sport, chances are they're not allowed to do that anyway. It's on the banned substances list. So to me, it just seems like a crazy idea. But then again, I'm of a generation that really hasn't thought about doing that stuff until people were in their 40s and 50s or even never. So is there ever a case for somebody in their 20s or 30s to take testosterone if their blood levels are within the 300 to 900 nanograms per deciliter reference range? KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases. The reason for any performance enhancing drug, whether or not it is a steroid, synthetic, bioidentical, or otherwise, varies a lot. Some individuals do it only for cosmetic reasons even if it can have deleterious effects on the cosmetic appearance, for example, of your skin in the long run. But everyone has their different reasons. As far as like when does the benefit outweigh the detriment, not very often if you're in your 20s and certainly-- probably-- almost hardly never. There's always rare cases, like Coleman syndrome and whatnot, but almost never if you're very young. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people in their 20s, 30s, and beyond-- 40s, et cetera-- whose testosterone and estrogen levels are at the appropriate ratios, and then within the normal reference range, and they feel pretty good-- [CHUCKLES] we talked about the ADAMs exam-- or this sort of like feel-pretty-good is code for libido, energy, recovery, et cetera, and are feeling at least workable for their lifestyle. For those people, what can they do besides get great sleep, train, but not too hard or too often, et cetera, et cetera? What are some of the things in the realm of supplementation that can help them optimize their testosterone and estrogen without suppressing their own endogenous production of testosterone and estrogen? KYLE GILLETT: Let's mention creatine is the first one. Creatine is interesting because it has multiple different effects. It helps with amino acid synthesis. It also helps with oxidative stress. It can also serve as the backup fuel tank for your mitochondria, so holding backup ATP. And it does slightly increase total testosterone, and it also increases the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, so potentially it's especially useful in men in even their teenage years and their 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and there is mythology out there that creatine can increase hair loss, I'm guessing because there's at least one study showing that creatine can increase DHT-- dihydrotestosterone. And DHT is one of the primary hormones that can promote male pattern baldness. So the question therefore is, does creatine supplementation increase the rate of hair loss? KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically, it can, but in each individual, preventing hair loss is a very poor reason to take creatine, because it's not going to take you to a supraphysiologic level, it's not going to increase your androgens to a unnormal level of binding. So I feel like this-- if that was a reason to not take creatine for hair loss, then that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mean-- sorry-- hair loss is not a reason to avoid taking creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Hair loss is not a reason to avoid taking creatine. Think of it as just bringing you to what you are naturally inclined to have. If your conversion of testosterone to DHT is already high, then often, creatine does not affect this. It just kind of resets your balance between testosterone being aromatized to estrogen or being 5-alpha reduced DHT. So it's not going to speed up hair loss more than just naturally being a male does. So in some individuals, it will have no effect. In some individuals-- for whatever reason, they have almost no 5-alpha reductase activity-- it will return them to natural or normal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. Well, I take 5 grams a day of creatine monohydrate. I do it for the tissue volumizing effects, so for exercise benefits, but also for the cognitive effects. I don't know if it's increasing my hair loss. I mean, I've got a little bit of widow's peak type hair loss. That's where it is for me. I suppose beard growth is associated with DHT too. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Yes ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I learned-- but then again I haven't been into those literature in a long time-- is that because of differences in receptors, that DHT causes hair growth on the face and hair loss on the head. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, and the amount, and the sensitivity, and density of those receptors is genetically determined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And is it true that if your mother's father was bald that you will be bald in the same pattern, and if he wasn't, you won't? KYLE GILLETT: That is a decent correlation. Part of the proposed mechanism of this-- well, there are several genes, and you can actually test your genes for hair loss. You do get a decent amount of them from your mother. The unique thing you get from your mother that she may have gotten from her father-- that she got one of the copies from her father-- is your X chromosome. And the androgen receptor gene is on your X chromosome, so all men got their androgen receptor gene from their mother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's on their X chromosome, not on the Y chromosome. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Even though all of the, quote, unquote, male promoting genes are on the Y chromosome, like malaria, and inhibiting, et cetera. Interesting. So 5 grams a day of creatine for most people should be fine. Beneficial for tissue volumizing-- so strength, bringing water into the muscles-- and for the cognitive effects. And the clinical support for creatine, I think, is quite strong at the 5 gram per day dosage. What other sorts of supplements can people benefit from? We already talked about the omegas and making sure that people are getting enough prebiotic fiber to support the gut microbiome and vitamin D. So what other supplement-based tools can people consider? KYLE GILLETT: Another one we can loop in with creatine is betaine. Some people are nonresponders to creatine, so you can increase that to 10 grams, or you can use its cousin betaine to help with amino acid synthesis and shunting of energy. Along with that, I would put l-carnitine which is actually the smallest peptide hormone. It's just two amino acids that are put together, so it's a-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a hormone? Interesting. I'm not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just-- I'm not challenging it. KYLE GILLETT: I would call it a peptide more than a hormone. So I would not call l-carnitine a hormone, but I would call dopamine a hormone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I could-- a neurohormone. It's so hard to define things as transmitters or hormones at some level. I agree. So l-carnitine-- actually, I should backtrack. Betaine-- do you recall what dosage people typically would take if they're a creatine non-responder? KYLE GILLETT: 1 to 3 grams. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Per day? KYLE GILLETT: In fact-- yeah-- several versions of creatine have betaine mixed in because it helps with the processing of methionine and homocysteine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if somebody is already taking creatine and likes it and responds to it-- I'll raise my hand-- such as myself, would adding betaine help or is it redundant with creatine? KYLE GILLETT: Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated. And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker that can build up if you're not converting enough of it down stream. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How would I know? KYLE GILLETT: Just a blood test or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism, which is basically how you add methyl groups to many things in the body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Any side effects of betaine that people should be aware of? KYLE GILLETT: Not that I know of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can look it up on-- examine.com is a great site for that. They'll surely list it. They just revamped their site by the way, and it was awesome before, and it's platinum now. So l-carnitine-- what are the ways to take l-carnitine? I know that there is oral forms in capsules and there's injectables. The injectables, I think you need a prescription. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. You need a prescription for the injectables, or you should really get a prescription for the injectables. For when you inject it-- of course, at the supervision of your doctor-- it's usually done intramuscularly. It's an aqueous solution, so it does not have an oil or a carrier oil in it like TR-- like testosterone esters do. However, if you inject it too superficially, it's not going to make or break anything. Often, it just burns if you inject it subcutaneously and it does not disseminate throughout the body as well. L-carnitine potentially has localized effects if you inject it. If you ingest it orally, then it has a very low bioavailability-- maybe only 10%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I think most people are going to be able to get l-carnitine only-- or in its capsule form. So what are the dosages of l-carnitine that one needs to ingest then if they want to get a benefit because if only 10% is being absorbed, it's probably a lot of l-carnitine. How much should people take per day? KYLE GILLETT: Usually, I recommend for oral l-carnitine between 1,000 milligrams and up to 4,000 or 5,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 1 to 4-- maybe even 5 grams. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. Up to 5 grams a day. If you're on that much, especially if you have a dysregulated gut microbiome, you should be concerned with TMAO which is a potential carcinogen that both carnitine and choline can convert into. And your gut microbiota determine how much that happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it true that I can offset any negative effects of alpha GPC-- choline that is-- and l-carnitine that I take by ingesting garlic? Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: There's a compound in garlic called allicin-- I believe it's A-L-L-I-C-I-N. It's also part of the scientific name-- the genus of types of garlic. And this can help decrease the conversion to TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases the conversion to TMAO as well probably through alteration of the gut microbiome. And then just optimizing your gut microbiome can decrease conversion. So not everyone needs allicin, but it's something that you should certainly consider if you were on a high dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm going to continue to take the 600 milligrams of garlic every time I take my l-carnitine, but I'm going to skip the berberine because berberine gives me brutal headaches and it makes me crave carbohydrates because it drops my blood sugar. KYLE GILLETT: It has many other effects, including the dawn phenomenon where it drops your blood sugar when you're sleeping and you can't even realize it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I am not a fan of berberine, and I'm sorry for those of you that are. I'm not trying to offend anyone, although frankly, if you're being offended by my stance on berberine, then maybe we should have another discussion. In any case injectable l-carnitine, if one can get that through a doctor, how much is absorbed and how much should one take? KYLE GILLETT: Almost all of it's absorbed. In general you're taking between 500 milligrams up to-- you can take a pretty high dose up to 2,000 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what we did not talk about is what l-carnitine does? So why should why should someone go through all of this? Is it to optimize testosterone, is it working on the receptor side? What's l-carnitine doing? KYLE GILLETT: It's a shuttle. So I think it's named carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. Basically, it just takes nutrients from outside your mitochondria and puts them in. It also has a unique effect-- well, not too unique because tadalafil actually has this effect as well-- is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor and the cytoplasm of your cells. So even if your androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't change and even if your testosterone does not change, you will have more testosterone binding to that increased number of receptors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does one need to cycle l-carnitine, creatine, betaine? KYLE GILLETT: No reason to cycle any of those. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What other supplements can one use to try and improve hormone profiles? And here, I realize we're using a very broad brush because when we say improve hormone profiles, what are we really talking about? And for me, at least, I think about the subjective stuff. Do people feel like they are going to have more energy as a consequence of doing these things, are they going to have the more optimized libido, or are they going to have more optimized recovery from exercise? Because, I mean, it's not clear to me that taking one's testosterone from 600 to 800 is always going to be a good thing, especially if estrogen is increasing in parallel. That could cause issues. It could certainly make things better. It could certainly make things worse. So with that backdrop, what are some of the other things people can take? And then we'll go back to this issue of what really is optimization. KYLE GILLETT: Let's briefly mention vitamin D, which is also a hormone. It's actually a sterile hormone. And if you have deficient vitamin D and you replace it, then you will optimize your testosterone. Let's also mention boron. So if you have a very high SHBG, boron can acutely help lower it usually in a dose of 5 to 12 milligrams per day. It's not really a sustained effect, but boron is depleted in soils in many countries. I believe it's very high in soils in Greece and Turkey. So eating dates or raisins that are from those areas potentially have more boron. Boron also might be one of the reasons why the reference range for testosterone is much higher in those countries than other countries. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And just to remind people, that SHBG sex hormone binding globulin is attaching to the testosterone molecule and limiting the amount of so-called free testosterone that's available to have its impact on cells. When Dr. Peter Attia was on this podcast-- in fact, sitting in that very chair-- he said that the ideal level of free testosterone in males should be about 2% of one's total testosterone. Would you agree with that number or disagree? I'm sure Peter would be fine if you said either. [CHUCKLES] KYLE GILLETT: 2% is a good rule of thumb. Usually, the reference range is between about 1% and 4%. Some people do have genetic polymorphisms in SHBG, a specific gene mutation where they have very low SHBGs. Also men that have varicose veins in their testes, also known as varicoceles, tend to have very high SHBGs, so that percentage would likely be less than 2%. So just because your percentage of free T to total T is a little bit above or below 2%, that's OK. We just need to figure out the reason why it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How would somebody know if they have varicose veins in their testicles, especially if their testicles are still in-- attached to their body? KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes, it's hard to tell. There are several grades. If you have a grade 3 or a grade 4 varicocele, it has what's called a bag of worms appearance. So think about if you've just resistance trained, or it's a really hot day, or you're wearing very tight fitting clothing, then if you feel it and almost feels like there's worms in the scrotum. The other way is to do-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a scary visual. KYLE GILLETT: --yeah, bag of worms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it was just that-- yeah, anyway. I think parasites when I hear that, but that's not what you're referring to. You're talking about just the texture. KYLE GILLETT: The best way for most people to check is to valsalva for a long period of time. When you valsalva, venous return will decrease. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can you explain valsalva for people? KYLE GILLETT: It's bearing down like you're lifting a weight or having a bowel movement, where you swallow. And a lot of times, you can almost see build up of blood in you're jugular veins as well. So you have decreased blood return to the heart and increased blood in the veins themselves. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular bloodwork done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So vitamin D3-- I'm guessing you're talking about vitamin D3 specifically when you say vitamin D-- and then boron, 5 to 12 milligrams per day. And then what are some of the other things to optimize testosterone that are in supplement form? KYLE GILLETT: We can talk about things that affect the steroidogenesis cascade. So we could touch on tongkat ali. I know we've talked about that a little bit before-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I'm guessing a number of people probably haven't heard that conversation. KYLE GILLETT: Also known as Long Jack. And that upregulates several different enzymes in the steroidogenesis cascade. And by that, what you mean if-- and this is another good thing to Google-- I think anybody interested in hormone optimization should understand where sterile hormones come from. They come usually from cholesterol and they can be shunted off to vitamin D very easily, they can be shunted off to testosterone, or estrogens, or progestins quite easily as well. But tongkat helps with the conversion of multiple key steps where you synthesize testosterone. Another-- think of it as like a coenzyme or a cofactor-- an upregulator of these steps is insulin and IGF-1. So a good rule of thumb is if you are not expecting as much growth hormone, insulin, and IGF-1-- for example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits, you're trying to cut body fat or body weight-- then tongkat is going to be theoretically especially powerful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What sorts of dosages of tongkat do you recommend to your patients? KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere from 300 to 1,200 milligrams a day. With tongkat, you need to be careful with the standardization because-- and if you're thinking about a general tongkat supplement, which is by far the most well-studied-- then you're looking at the eurycomanone content, which is a plant compound that is likely the main active pharmacologic effect. So that's the compound that's having the effect on the body. And if you standardize the eurycomanone very, very high, then theoretically you're having more effect at a lower dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I take 400 milligrams of tongkat ali per day. I take it early in the day because it has a bit of a stimulant effect, and if I take it after 2:00 PM, it starts to inhibit my sleep. I've been taking it for years. And I rather like that the effects. It seems subtle but consistent. I've never cycled it. Do you recommend cycling it? KYLE GILLETT: I don't see any reason to cycle it. There is a reason to cycle some supplements, but no reason to cycle tongkat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My blood work tells me that it causes an increase in free testosterone for me and also a slight increase in luteinizing hormone for me. What are some of the other effects on various hormones that you've observed in the bloodwork of your patients taking tongkat ali? KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. And if you have a very high SHBG-- again, that's the protein that binds up your androgens and estrogens-- an extremely important protein-- the higher your SHBG, the more it helps decrease it. So they've studied tongkat in populations with very normal SHBGs and it does nothing for SHBG. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Does that mean it does nothing for somebody overall? So if somebody has an SHBG that's in the normal range, will taking tongkat benefit them in any other way? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll increase their total and free testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. Does it-- is it known to have effects on anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, or is it purely in these steroid synthesis pathways? Or steroid-- I should say synthesis, and receptor, and modulation pathways. KYLE GILLETT: There's no direct effect on those pathways. However, any time you alter your free androgen or free estrogen, particularly one without altering the other, it will alter the binding protein that binds thyroid hormones. So any change you make, whether it's natural optimization or hormone replacement, you're going to slightly skew your thyroid hormone profile. One common actionable example of this that I see often clinically is someone starts, let's say, estrogen replacement or testosterone replacement-- maybe they're taking an AI with their testosterone replacement-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Aromatase inhibitor? KYLE GILLETT: Correct, an aromatase inhibitor, which blocks the conversion to estrogen. If they're taking testosterone and they have very little estrogen, then you're going to decrease the binding protein, also known as thyroxine binding globulin, which binds active thyroid hormones. So if you start TRT and you either have low aromatase activity or no aromatase activity-- no conversion to estrogen-- then your free thyroid hormones will go up. Even just acutely, usually feedback inhibition, which is how the body talks to itself and says, we need to make more of this or less of this. But acutely, there's not always enough time. You're going to have very high thyroid hormones and you can have tachycardia, which is a fast heart rate or you can feel kind of like overly fight or flight due to increased thyroid hormone activity in the in tissue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. So tongkat ali-- just a broad range-- 300 to 1,200 milligrams per day. And I realize that the source matters there. What are some of the other hormones that you prescribe to your patients who do not want to go on testosterone replacement therapy or take exogenous DHEA or anything like that? KYLE GILLETT: We can talk about fadogia next. Fadogia is interesting because-- it's a genus of plants. Fadogia agrestis is one of them. There's many others that are very interesting. That species is likely the most well-studied, and it will increase LH, so I would not consider it an LH mimetic, so it doesn't really mimetic. But it increases the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary. That's a hormone that binds to the Leydig cell to the LH receptor kind of like hCG does. And it will increase the release of testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. So I think for people who aren't familiar with hCG-- so human chorionic gonadotropin-- is basically synthetic luteinizing hormone and luteinizing hormone is the hormone released from the pituitary that is going to travel down to the testes to stimulate the production of sperm and testosterone, but mainly testosterone. Is that correct? KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic LH is also known as little r LH, or recombinant LH. And hCG can be synthetic, but often, it is just refined from the urine of pregnant ladies since the placenta makes it. That's why it's called chorionic gonadotropin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So where are they getting all this pregnant women's urine? I mean, there a location? I mean, not that I want to go there, I just-- KYLE GILLETT: Donation? ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really-- so there are women that-- KYLE GILLETT: First trimester pregnant ladies. It's very high. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Donating their urine, and then they're purifying it, and then men are injecting it? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. KYLE GILLETT: And that's actually the same for menopausal ladies. So first trimester pregnant ladies, that's how you can make non-synthetic hCG. And then for menotropins which are also known-- there's a couple of different names for it, like menopur. You have menopausal ladies that have very high LH and FSH, and then you refine the FSH and LH. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving away from the sources and from urine, Fadogia agrestis, what dosages do you have patients take? I've heard of some potential toxicity to the testicular cells. KYLE GILLETT: There is one study-- and this is a rat study, but you can equate the dose of toxicity in rats and humans. They did not give these rats any antioxidants, but it increases a couple of different proinflammatory markers. One is GGT, or gamma glutamate transferase. It comes from both the testes and the liver, and one is alkaline phosphatase, also known as Alkphos, again, coming from both areas. There are several different ways that you can attenuate this increase. And you can also just check to see if you have increased. In the rat dose that equates with humans that had no effect-- so the safe dose-- was an average of 300 milligrams a day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that would be 300 milligrams a day in humans is the dosage that did not have toxicity. Correct? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. And often, even if there is toxicity in rats, there is not toxicity in humans. So it's not directly equitable, but to be safe, another regimen that I have people take is 600 milligrams every other day or 600 milligrams three times a week-- often Monday, Wednesday, Friday. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is very interesting and relevant, because I've been taking fadogia for some period of time. All my markers and tests indicate that there's no toxicity. But I've been taking 600 milligrams per day, but I've been cycling it for about 8 to 12 weeks on and then a few weeks off. But based on what you're saying, I'm thinking maybe three times per week or every other day might be better. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: If you weren't going to get any labs, that is certainly the regimen that you want. If you're going to check your GGT and ALK phos, or even take other things to prevent those from increasing, then you can certainly be more aggressive with your fadogia dosing. You can increase it quite a bit, and it has a dose dependent response in both the activities associated with high testosterone and also just LH and testosterone. So the more aggressive regimen would be 600 milligrams daily for a month and then take one to two weeks off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. I think that's more or less what I've been doing. Terrific. In terms of other hormones, what are some of the supplements that can support growth hormone-- a hormone that's associated with tissue repair and, in some cases, metabolism and fat loss? What are some of the tools, nutritional and/or supplement-based, one can do to tap on the growth hormone pathway? And let's lump IGF-1 in there too since they're essentially working along the same dimensions. KYLE GILLETT: A quick synopsis-- growth hormone is a peptide hormone, and it is released by the pituitary. There's growth hormone releasing hormone and ghrelin that stimulate the release. So there's also peptides that are very analogous to these two things. You have that pulsatile secretion of growth hormone in a very fast half life of just minutes, and then it increases IGF-1. There is both peripheral IGF-1 and central IGF-1 and IGF2, but no need to get into the specifics. There is a happy medium to where your growth hormone is at an adequate level and your IGF-1 is an adequate level. Usually, those two are congruent. So in most cases, we just check an IGF-1 and, occasionally, the binding peptides for IGF-1 kind of like SHBG that we talked about earlier, but you're estimating a free IGF-1. It's kind of confusing because all hormone-- almost all hormones have binding proteins to help regulate them. But often, you want to look at free testosterone, free estradiol, free IGF-1-- or at least estimate it-- free cortisol even, and free thyroid hormone. But when you're talking about growth hormone and IGF-1, usually you don't need to do anything to optimize it. If you are diabetic, then-- and depending on the type of diabetes, your IGF-1 and growth hormone can be too high. Specifically, in type 1 diabetes, your growth hormone is extremely high, but your IGF-1 is low. So if you're in a dysregulated state or have pathology, I would just talk to your doctor about IGF-1 or growth hormone. Taking amino acids before you go to bed could potentially help with growth hormone release just because most growth hormone is released while you sleep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've heard that fasting can increase growth hormone. And I know there are certain patterns of weight training that can increase growth hormone. Some of those regimens in the weight room that increase growth hormone have been covered by Dr. Duncan French, who was a guest on this podcast, and so maybe we'll refer people to that episode for the specific protocols-- these high volume training. KYLE GILLETT: During those training exercises, it usually does it transiently for a period of a few hours. And a lot of this IGF-1 is released by the muscle itself. So it's not necessarily released by the liver. IGF-1 that is released directly due to growth hormone signaling-- usually, the growth hormone comes from the pituitary and binds to the liver where usually, it has a half life of about a week, where the paracrine or autocrine-- think of it as like the peripherally acting or acting in the muscles itself, which is also helpful-- is released and is not as concerning because it's not related to insulin resistance, but it is related to the training itself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So fasting and growth hormone-- is it true that fasting can increase growth hormone? And maybe as a little related tangent, I've heard that limiting food intake for the two hours before going to sleep can increase the pulse of growth hormone that one experiences during sleep. Of course, everyone gets a pulse of growth hormone during sleep, but especially carbohydrate-laden meals can blunt that peak that occurs during sleep quite substantially. So two questions-- does avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep help increase growth hormone release? Maybe it's being overly neurotic. Maybe people need to avoid food in the four hours before sleep. But regardless, what is the relationship between fasting and growth hormone release? I find this really interesting. KYLE GILLETT: Fasting certainly potently increases growth hormone release. However, the IND binding to the receptor is less sensitive. So although fasting does increase growth hormone, the genes that are downstream to it-- both the growth hormone genes and IGF-1 related gene transcription activity-- will not be significantly higher. However, if you are optimizing the growth hormone that is released as a pulsatile secretion, it is helpful to avoid eating for two hours. So the general rule of thumb is avoid eating about two hours before bed. I think that's clinically significant and helpful. But fasting otherwise specifically for growth hormone optimization in someone who already has normal growth hormone signaling is not helpful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's extremely useful to hear because one of the major reasons why people fast is to get that growth hormone increase. But if they're adjusting things on the backend that negate that, well, then, no such luck. Not that I have anything against fasting. I do a pseudointermittent fasting mostly because I prefer to eat at fairly regular times of day. So it doesn't sound like there's a lot that people can take in supplement form to improve growth hormone. What about thyroid hormone? What are some of the things that people can take or do in order to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are appropriate? KYLE GILLETT: You want to have a balance of iodine and you want to have a good source of iodine. So there are some camps that say you should use a huge high dose of iodine and there's protocols for it. And there are some that say you should use just barely enough iodine-- I believe it's like 200 micrograms per day. But you want to balance. One of the things that I see that many people do not talk about when it comes to iodine and thyroid is there's compounds known as goitrogens. And these goitrogens are neither good nor evil, but they're actually kind of a nice check and balance. You need more iodine if you consume more goitrogens. And some examples of these are some of my favorite foods-- cruciferous vegetables. Boron is also a goitrogen. So higher goitrogens, higher iodine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So ingesting iodine containing salt is useful? Yes or no? KYLE GILLETT: Iodized salt does prevent goiter, but it is not necessarily the ideal form of iodine. Good forms of iodine often come from the ocean. If you look at a chart of hypothyroidism, there is a tendency to have more hypothyroidism the more inland you go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So trying to eat some cruciferous vegetables each day would be the best way to improve thyroid hormone. KYLE GILLETT: Along with plenty of iodine. You don't want too much iodine signaling. Many people are familiar with radioactive iodine tablets, and that's basically an extremely high amount of iodine to block out the radioactive iodine that comes from after like a nuclear meltdown or whatnot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So we've got creatine, betaine, l-carnitine, with allicin garlic to offset the TMAO. Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat ali, fadogia, some fasting. I'd love to talk to you about peptides. So I can imagine a hierarchy. A hierarchy starts with behaviors and nutrition. Behaviors, of course, includes training, and limiting stress, and all the things we talked about before-- sunshine et cetera-- and optimize nutrition. Then, we talked about supplements-- all the things we just listed off to optimize testosterone. And we can get into this, but estrogen as well, which is important for libido, and brain function, and tissue function, and joints feeling good, et cetera. But then we get into the realm where one might, or could consider, exogenous hormones. Get-- taking a small dose of testosterone or taking a small dose of GH even if that were appropriate and certainly only working with a doctor. But in between, there's a step of so-called peptides. And of course, there are many peptides. We've already talked about some of them. But when people talk about taking peptides, the ones that I hear most often about is a category that increases GH and IGF-1, and those to my knowledge go by the things like sermorelin sort of a kit of things that are taken separately or in combination to increase GH and IGF-1. But then other people, for instance, are taking peptides like BPC 157 to try and improve tissue healing and recovery. There's a lot of interest in peptides. Please, if you would, tell us about what you know about the safety of peptides in terms of their sourcing and the utility of peptides. Is this something that people should consider before thinking about hormone replacement? Should people be wary of these things? I am very wary of particular sources that are sold online that are not clean. They contain contaminants and that could be dangerous. I really would love your thoughts on peptides. So I'm just going to sit back and let you riff on peptides, but if you could touch on some of the ones that I mentioned, I'd be most grateful. KYLE GILLETT: A peptide is just a chain of amino acids between two and a couple hundred in length. So I think of peptides as several different categories. And the GHRPs that you mentioned, I would consider those-- and that stands for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide. You have two main types-- the ghrelin agonist that are-- or they hit the ghrelin receptor, and it helps release growth hormone because of that. And then also the GHRH-like peptides. So they're very similar to growth hormone releasing hormone. Often, they just change a couple amino acids, and it acts like that. Tesamorelin is one of them, sermorelin is another one, and CJC is another common one. I believe those are all in the class of GHRH-like peptides, whereas ipamorelin or ibutamoren, which is also known as MK-677, those two are in the class of ghrelin agonist. So they're more like they hit the receptor that ghrelin does whereas the other ones hit the GHRH receptor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think of ghrelin as making me hungry. KYLE GILLETT: Hungry and angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why would I want to take something that would increase ghrelin signaling? KYLE GILLETT: Some people are trying to gain weight. It also does increase your growth hormone. So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it. Ibutamoren is a long-acting-- so it has a long half life, also known as MK-677. It was well-- it was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do these people get angry also? KYLE GILLETT: They can. Many people report a side effect of anxiety or significant hunger. Most people take it in the evening so they don't notice that hunger as much. It can also greatly increase your blood glucose. So if you're insulin resistant or pre-diabetic, it gets especially concerning. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is one of those rare moments where I hear something and I think, even though there is this kit of compounds that can increase GH and IGF-1, based on everything you're telling me, maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people, because growth hormone, at least it's-- synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone. I mean, certainly not taking anything might be the ideal. But for those that want to increase growth hormone and they want to use pharmacology to do that, it sounds like these peptides are pretty precarious. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, it kind of depends on the situation. If there's an individual that struggles with hunger and not eating enough-- for example, someone who has a very small stomach or they just have a very low hunger drive, sometimes you want more of that orexigenic signaling. The hypothalamus, you have anorexia signaling, which is kind of like anorexia, and orexigenic signaling, which is-- I call it the hangry center of the hypothalamus or the hangry center. And if there's an imbalance between those two, then perhaps it'd be helpful. Potentially theoretically helpful in anorexics, of which, the incidence of anorexia in men is increasing significantly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As you're telling me this, I'm remembering being 14 or 15 years old, and I would go into the kitchen sometimes, and I was so hungry I would just obliterate all the food. And I do remember being-- I've always been a pretty high energy guy, but having an immense amount of energy. I can't recall if it was a hangry feeling or not, but I'm guessing that was growth hormone. I grew one foot in a single academic year, so I imagine that was at least in part due to growth hormone. In any case, sermorelin is the peptide that I hear most often about. I admittedly tried a run of it. I was researching a book, and decided to take it before sleep on an empty stomach. It gave me a tremendous depth of sleep, but that sleep was really truncated, which is just nerd speak for saying deep but short sleep. I would wake up after very intense dreams. I can't say that it helped me recover from exercise that much. I didn't notice any additional fat loss or anything. Sort of abandoned it except for occasional use. Again, this was prescribed by a doctor. I'm starting to get the sense that these peptides and their effects are somewhat vague, and distributed, and highly individual. Is that a fair way to describe them? KYLE GILLETT: Part of the problem with the effect of peptides is many people take them and levels that are far above the physiologic range. Even individuals who are checking their IGF-1 while they take these different GHRPs, most of them do not check the binding peptides-- for example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, or 3. And their free IGF-1 level might be significantly different. So common doses that people will take these off-label for as a supplement are often much greater than the therapeutic or physiologic range. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which, for me, just underscores the fact that it's pretty precarious. I mean, I'm not coming in here as the referee of what anyone should or shouldn't do. I'm just trying to gather and distribute information. But I've heard, for instance, that some companies where people can acquire these things without prescription, those companies are not good at cleaning out the lipopolysaccharide-- the LPS-- which can cause an inflammatory response. In other words, these are dirty compounds. And that just sounds risky. It just sounds-- frankly, it just sounds really dangerous to me. KYLE GILLETT: LPS is a common additive in many companies that are not pharmacies, but they're selling things that people often use as human consumption. One interesting note about lipopolysaccharide is your gut microbiome actually makes a lot of it as well, especially prevotella which is a specific species, that can have to do with your baseline body temperature. So your baseline body temperature might also change depending on if you're on a peptide that has LPS in it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes, yikes, and yikes. [CHUCKLES] But I tend to be pretty conservative when it comes to taking anything exogenous. But I do rely on many of the supplements that we talked about earlier and I do try and optimize the behavioral things and nutritional things for a long time. So then leaving peptides behind, we are now I suppose in the territory of exogenous hormone. So let's say that somebody decides they're not concerned with fertility, or they're going to bank sperm, or they already have kids, or they're going to defer on this issue of wanting to have kids, my understanding is that nowadays, a lot of people are using testosterone-- let's not even call it replacement therapy, because some of these people have 600, 700, or even 800 nanogram per deciliter read. So they're not replacing anything that is diminished. They're just trying to augment what's already there-- increase what's already there. My understanding is that taking a low dose more frequently is going to be more beneficial than the kind of old school way of giving 100 or even 200 milligrams in a single injection once every two weeks. Is that right? And what do you do with your patients? So let me give you a hypothetical. Somebody comes into your office, they do their blood work, and they have blood levels of, let's say, 600 nanogram per deciliter testosterone. Their estrogen is also in normal range. Everything else checks out, but they're complaining of slightly diminished libido, slightly poor recovery from workouts, maybe reduced motivation and drive, although no major depression. And you come to the conclusion that testosterone therapy-- not replacement, but testosterone therapy might be a good option to explore. What's a typical dosage range and frequency of administration range that you might consider exploring? KYLE GILLETT: And some of this depends on the SHBG and free testosterone as well. So if that same individual had a very high SHBG which, again, is the binding protein that binds up the testosterone and all androgens and estrogens, if it is extremely high and they have a free testosterone of two, then they might need a different dose because they need enough testosterone in order to have a normal eugonadal free testosterone. But a general normal dosing range, especially for someone starting, is around 100 to 120 milligrams divided over the course of a week, usually either every other day or three times a week-- occasionally, twice a week. Many people with SHBG a bit higher can get away pretty easily with twice a week. This is assuming that the ester is cypionate or enanthate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So two 60 milligram injections of testosterone cypionate per week. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, very common dosing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: To hit that 120 milligrams per week is kind of the typical average. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. And I would consider this like a physiologic eugonadal dose. For many people, even 200 milligrams a week is far above the reference range. All of this is said with the caveat that testosterone is normally released in a pulsatile manner. So it's high in the morning, low in the evening. Whereas if you're on testosterone therapy, then you're going to have a steady state. So your testosterone level is going to be pretty much the same even in the evening. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And in your experience, when patients do that, I'm guessing they report that normal constellation of positive effects-- improved mood, improved energy, improve sleep, recovery, et cetera. What are some of the hazards or things that can crop up in bloodwork or just subjectively that can be warning signs that even a dosage of 120 milligrams divided into these two or three dosages per week is too high? KYLE GILLETT: Every organ system in the body. So this is when you really have to be at least well-versed in every organ system, not just the gonadal genital system. You need to have dermatology prowess. Acne is very common change. Lots of different skin pathologies or even bruising can be related to hormone replacement. Hair loss is very common to see as well. Mental status changes. It could occasionally even induce as a manic or a bipolar episode because testosterone is also dopaminergic. And then a cardiovascularly not just in the heart, but also concerns for like microvascular ischemic disease. Ferritin buildup because the estrogen also increases. And then fertility concerns as well and lipid concerns too. So you really have to be hematologist, dermatologist, cardiologist, lipidologist, the whole 9 yards. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So another reason-- or set of reasons rather to, if one is considering using testosterone therapy, to really do this in close communication with a really good physician because that's a lot to monitor. Knowing whether or not you have acne or not is one thing, but knowing whether or not your LDL is going up, your ApoB is going up, that's a whole other biz and that needs to be done through bloodwork is what I'm hearing. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. And if your physician that is managing or prescribing your testosterone therapy or your HRT is not well-versed in these systems, you would want him or her to be part of an interdisciplinary team where they have other experts that can monitor those systems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I skipped over a sort of still intermediate set of things-- prescription drugs-- but maybe talking about testosterone first was a bit of a mistake on my part because I'm aware that there are-- actually, I think there are companies, but certainly groups out there that say, no, wait-- don't go straight from nothing to supplements to testosterone. Once you're doing behaviors and optimizing nutrition supplements-- let's forget peptides-- instead of going straight to testosterone therapy, one idea that many people are pursuing is to take the prescription drugs that trigger luteinizing hormones-- so taking hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin, which my understanding is will increase testosterone, but also estrogen. Or they'll take things like clomiphene. In fact, I think there are a bunch of companies out there now that are saying don't take testosterone-- it shuts down spermatogenesis, it shuts down testosterone production-- clomiphene is the way to go. Maybe you could educate us about the hCG monotherapy, I think it's called, where you're just mono-- one-- just taking hCG and clomiphene as a-- and/or clomiphene as a tool to ratchet up hormones. KYLE GILLETT: So a quick points on hCG-- human chorionic gonadotropin-- made during especially the first trimester of pregnancy, it has effects other than binding to the LH receptor. It also binds to the TSH receptor in the thyroid. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it's thyroid stimulating hormone? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. In fact, if you look at a molecule of hCG and thyroid stimulating hormone, they are extremely similar. However, you need a relatively high dose of hCG to bind to the TSH receptor. This is the normal mechanism in pregnancy that accounts for the increased need of thyroid hormone-- usually, about 30% to 40%. So that's why if someone has hypothyroidism, you increase their dose of thyroid, because the hCG is not going to be doing it for you. The Clomid, or clomiphene, there's two main-- I believe it's diastereomers. And one of them is enclomiphene and one of them is zuclomiphene. And these two work slightly differently. Enclomiphene, I believe, has a faster half life and it is potentially slightly better tolerated. However, they were studying it-- Clomid is a very commonly prescribed drug, and obviously, there is plenty of enclomiphene in Clomid. However, the drug which was Andrew androxal-- A-N-D-R-O-X-A-L-- did not go all the way through the FDA approval process despite Clomid being FDA approved. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So there's Clomid which contains clomiphene, but there are also-- because we're talking about male hormone optimization this episode-- there are males out there who want to increase their testosterone and other hormones-- maybe growth hormone, et cetera-- who opt to not take exogenous testosterone-- so no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cypionate-- but decide to take clomiphene a couple of times a week. My understanding-- I've never done this. I would say if I had. My understanding is that taking clomiphene-- maybe two 50 milligram tablets a week is what I hear people are doing-- will increase what-- luteinizing hormone, the various estrogen receptor subunits? Could you explain how clomiphene would benefit anyone, and is this a good strategy? I'm hearing that it's being done quite a lot now. KYLE GILLETT: It will increase testosterone in a dose dependent manner, but it has many other pharmacodynamic effects, which is the effect of the drug on the body other than its effect on the hypothalamus and the pituitary. So in the hypothalamus and the pituitary, it does what's called negative feedback inhibition or it blocks the action of estrogen. So it crowds out estrogen from the estrogen receptor on the hypothalamus and the pituitary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what's this objective effect that would cause? So to my understanding and experience of estrogen is that if I ever took-- and I did take a very low dose of an aromatase inhibitor once and I felt terrible. Actually reduced libido, joints felt achy. That's when I discovered that, wow, estrogen is actually really important for your brain function, for joint function, and for libido. And suppressing estrogen, for me, it just turned out to be the wrong idea. But my levels indicate that it's within reference range. So why would I want to take something that would increase the activity of an estrogen receptor? I just can't find the rationale for that. KYLE GILLETT: The main rationale behind taking a serm is as a very temporary measure that is not going to suppress pituitary or hypothalamic function if your testosterone is just so drastically low that it is unlikely to recover anyway. So most of the time it is not clinically useful, and serm should not be prescribed very often, certainly not as long term testosterone replacement or testosterone optimization in most individuals. There's always exceptions to everything. But there's five different estrogen and estrogen-related receptors. There's two main estrogen receptors. And clomid and every serm has a very unique profile because they selectively inhibit some receptors in some tissues, but not other receptors in other tissues. For example, Clomid can inhibit receptors that are in the eye, and it can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially at higher doses. And it also acts in every other tissue of the body. So a side effects from Clomid and other selective estrogen receptor modifiers are very common. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm at least-- by my mind, I'm going to pool them with peptides and say it sounds precarious and probably not ideal for most people. Going back to testosterone therapy then-- and notice, folks, I've deleted the replacement part because I think so many people are using testosterone therapy without the need to-- the sort of reference range need to replace anything, but rather are building on what they already have for purposes of increasing vitality, et cetera. Going back to that, my understanding is that taking hCG several times per week can help maintain spermatogenesis and fertility even while people are on testosterone. But-- and you and I were talking about this earlier-- that there's tremendous variation. Some people will take a small amount testosterone and just crush their sperm count. They just won't make any viable sperm. Other people can maintain viable sperm production while on testosterone, especially if they're taking hCG. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. And there's many reasons for this. Some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes, so potentially cold therapy could be helpful for that. And-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just avoid-- and certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna and hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT: Stopping the daily hot tub can restore fertility in many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know a number of people that are trying to conceive children that go into the sauna, and they'll just put a cold pack in their shorts or between their legs depending on whether or not they're wearing shorts or not when they go in. Or they'll alternate ice and heat in a way that maintains coolness of the milieu in which the sperm live. In other words, they're cooling their scrotum deliberately in order to avoid killing the sperm. Actually, I saw an interesting paper that said that for every two degree increase in temperature of the scrotum, there's a 20% decrease in spermatogenesis and viability of sperm. And that actually, if you look at the difference between people who stand a lot, sit a lot, and drive a lot, what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm count because when people are sitting, there's an increase in temperature, and then when they're sitting on the hot seat of the car, there's an-- or using the heated seats, actually, it kills sperm. I think there are good data on that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, and anecdotally, you see it as well. I've had several patients come in for fertility consultations. And all we do is like, no medications, no supplements. We change their-- several lifestyle things. Very tight fitting clothing is another one. And soon, they have fertility again and they're no longer-- they have sperm whereas before, they did not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. I'd like to talk about some of the do's and don'ts, but we have talked about a lot of do's-- things that one can do to optimize hormones. Maybe we could just do sort of more rapid fire Q&A on some of the don'ts and maybe throw in some science where you feel it's appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC-- yes or no-- it diminishes testosterone levels? KYLE GILLETT: Smoked cannabis, I would say, diminishes testosterone, increases prolactin. That's a no. Other cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So CBD? KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD, I'm not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about edible cannabis and THC? KYLE GILLETT: As far as I know, edible cannabis and THC does not significantly increase prolactin to a point where it would be disruptive of hormones. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever you want to call it, increase gynecomastia-- the growth of male breast tissue? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it certainly can, and there's a pretty good association between smoked THC and gynecomastia. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about nicotine and testosterone and estrogen and other hormones-- smoked nicotine? KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine is particularly concerning not only for testosterone, but also for estrogen. Part of it is, if you're talking about nicotine from tobacco, there's many other carcinogens in it, especially if it's smoked. But nicotine, even if it is chewed in a dose dependent manner-- so if you can use an extremely small amount of nicotine, then it's not as concerning in the long run. But it's a vasoconstrictor, and one of the main concerns with it would be cardiovascular disease or even microvascular ischemic disease that can lead to neurodegenerative disease, so like a type of dementia that can be partly due to nicotine. If you use nicotine for a very long period of time, especially at a higher dose, it's a dose-dependent effect on your hormone profile. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that also true for Nicorette and other nicotine gums? KYLE GILLETT: At high doses, if you can use an extremely low dose of a nicotine gum, then theoretically, that would be maintainable. It's not going to overload the nicotinic receptor. You have acetylcholine and the cholinergic system is one of your main nervous systems, of course. And you have muscarinic receptors and nicotinic receptors, and there's just better ways to optimize your nicotinic receptor activity. For example, acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine. Weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, potentially have a part as well. And then other alkaloids. So nicotine is an alkaloid from the tobacco plant. There are other plants like cytosine and that genus of plants, and that alkaloid is also a nicotine receptor agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it true that cycling for too long-- literally, bicycling-- sitting on a bike seat too long can damage the prostate? KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it can be very concerning, especially if you're seated while cycling, especially if you're putting a lot of pressure on the perineum. Your core is kind of like a box where your diaphragm sort of makes the top and your abs and serratus make the front and the sides. Your back muscles make the back, and then your pelvic floor makes the bottom of the box, which is arguably the most important part of your core. And that pressure can weaken and even lead to incontinence and impotence. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So we were talking earlier today in the gym about how heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts, those kinds of things a lot of guys are doing to increase their testosterone, done correctly, can actually augment and build up the strength of the pelvic floor. Done incorrectly, can actually weaken the pelvic floor and lead to all sorts of issues, including sexual effects-- negative sexual effects. So how does one go about learning whether or not their movements are being done properly to support pelvic floor or to destruct pelvic floor? KYLE GILLETT: The pelvic floor is a constellation of muscles just like any other kind of like system in the body. And form is important. If you're doing the valsalva maneuver, which again, is that bearing down or deep breath where you feel all of your abs are tight, you can also notice that your pelvic floor is tight as well. If you have a history of an inguinal hernia, which is a hole kind of like connecting the abdominal cavity down through the pelvic floor or even the scrotum in some cases-- and that can be a sign that there is weakness in that area, and you might have to concentrate it on it most, or even have a physiotherapist or a physical therapist specifically target the pelvic floor. Many exercises in which you valsalva or use your glutes or legs, you can learn to squeeze them and have that mind-muscle connection in order to help build up the pelvic floor. And there's other things. Many people are familiar with kegels. That is just one of the many different exercises that can help your pelvic floor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My understanding is that while strengthening the pelvic floor is good, excessive contraction of the pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow to the pelvic area, the penis, and so forth. So this is, again, a double-edged sword. I mean, you don't want guys out there to just start doing endless number of kegels every day because they're actually going to constrict blood flow to that area. There's-- and in fact, the erection response is parasympathetic. It's a relaxed induced response, right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for the-- the reason I chuckle is that for-- because we're talking about things, we don't have visuals or charts, and certainly, it's hard to know whether or not a given exercise like kegels are going to be good or not good. If it's excessive, what-- how many sets and reps does it take before it goes from good to bad. Is there a kind of general rule of thumb for people to think about this? I mean, clearly blood flow to that area is key for sexual performance. And yet when one trains the legs or even walks, you're getting blood flow. So my understanding is this that a combination of weight training to stimulate the positive hormonal, and muscular, and connective tissue growth is key provided it's not overtraining, but so is casual exercise like walking, and stretching, and the sorts of things that will then return blood flow to that area. Is that an overly basic way to think about it or will that suffice? KYLE GILLETT: I think that's a good way to think about it. I think the main point with kegels is they're just one of many different things. So if you're having some pelvic floor pathology certainly or even just concerned about your pelvic floor, don't just take the advice do kegels and you'll be OK. That is not near enough. It's just one of the many aspects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So going back to the rapid Q&A, and then we'll come back to this issue of blood flow because there's some interesting science and protocols there-- the question I have is, alcohol, does it increase aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen or not? And is there a dose dependence there? KYLE GILLETT: It significantly does. There is a dose dependence. In general, I would not recommend more than three to four standard drinks. One huge glass of wine is probably five standard drinks. But I'd say every two weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, that's consistent with what I discovered researching alcohol in an episode we did on alcohol. That no alcohol is definitely better for all aspects of health than any alcohol. And anyone that says that, well, red wine contains these various things, well, it doesn't contain enough of those positive things to have a positive effect. But that if people do opt to drink alcohol, that two drinks per week-- and meaning 20 grams of alcohol, so that's probably two 12 ounce beers or two 4 ounce glasses of wine-- is going to be the upper limit beyond which you're going to start seeing all sorts of negative effects. KYLE GILLETT: The other thing to keep in mind with alcohol is it has a lot of calories-- seven kilocalories per gram, almost as much as fat, which is 9. And then it's also very GABAergic, so it can activate inhibitory neurotransmission, and that can also affect how much LH and FSH is released. So that can also decrease testosterone almost kind of similar to how opiates can decrease testosterone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I feel very lucky that I don't enjoy alcohol-- never really did. I can kind of take it or leave it. I certainly don't like sedatives like Valium or anything like that, which, as you just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. You said the word fat, so I'm going to pick up on that and say, in order to optimize hormone production, is it important to have some saturated fat in one's diet? And what happens on very low fat diets to testosterone, and estrogen, and other steroid hormones? KYLE GILLETT: Fat is interesting because there are so many different beneficial fats. Omega 3s-- almost every American gets plenty of omega 6s-- in any developed country really. When it comes to saturated fat, there is more of a correlation with hormone optimisation. If you're eating things with saturated fat, you tend to have-- those are things with more fat soluble vitamins and things that are very nutrient dense otherwise. But it is not vital. In general, you want to eliminate any trans fat unless it's trans fat from the ruminants. There's always an exception to everything. So there are healthy trans omega 3 fats, which are formed in the stomach of grass fed and finished ruminants. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But ingesting mostly olive oils, maybe nut butters in limited amounts because they're very calorie dense, but-- unless people are trying to increase their calories, in which case, they're a great source of calories, small amounts of butter, ghee, probably OK, but not excessive amounts? Is that the idea? KYLE GILLETT: Yes. Fat is perfectly fine. Cholesterol has an interesting-- so cholesterol and, in general, phospholipids make the bilayer that's around the cell. But cholesterol is also a hormone in and of itself because it binds to the estrogen-related receptor alpha. So I consider that like in the estrogen receptor category, and that can help with metabolism, but also potentially have concerns for cancer and tumor risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want to go back to the prostate and talk to you about something that's kind of a newer emerging trend. I know that you've talked a little bit about this in previous podcasts, that a number of men-- or I should say a number of physicians are prescribing low dose tadalafil, also known as Cialis, to their male patients. So in dosage ranges of like 2.5 milligrams to 5 milligrams per day, but not for erectile dysfunction, but rather for improving prostate health. And presumably, they get sort of a boost in terms of blood flow to the genitalia as well. But again, not specifically to deal with erectile dysfunction, but to deal with prostate health and blood flow to the prostate. Is that something that you sometimes-- often prescribe to your patients, and of what age? KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil is a very underrated medication. The age would kind of depend on the indication. So tadalafil is also a blood pressure medication. It can very slightly decrease blood pressure, especially at higher doses. At higher doses, it-- a high dose would be 20 milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams. But consistently, it can somewhat affect with the cones in the eye that have to do with red and green sight. Although, if you remove it, that effect is reversed. So basically, if you don't need really, really good red/green discrimination, you can take higher doses. But in general, I recommend no higher than 10 milligrams a day-- usually just two or 5 milligrams. One other benefit or other use of tadalafil is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor similarly to l-carnitine. So that's an interesting benefit. Another benefit is that if you give it to people with nocturia, which is urinating at night in general, it will cut the episodes in half. So it could go from 2 to 1, which can make a big difference for your sleep, which will secondarily make a big difference for your growth hormone and testosterone optimization. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. So you said 2.5 to 5 milligrams per day is typical for these prostate enhancing effects. KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you mentioned the potential side effects on adjusting visual perception. As a vision scientist, that rings in my mind. But in terms of red/green color discrimination, I'm guessing unless you're going to be a subject in one of the experiments in my lab or you want to be a fighter pilot, chances are you can probably get away with a little less red/green color discrimination. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. It's not considered clinically significant unless someone is a commercial pilot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. KYLE GILLETT: So if someone's getting their pilot exam, that's one of the things we look for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So commercial pilots aside, you might want to ask your doctor about low dose tadalafil for sake of enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate specific antigen is important. I can give an anecdote there. When I tried sermorelin, one of the surprising side effects that was not welcome was a dramatic spike in my prostate specific antigen. No one could explain to me why that would happen, but when I stopped taking sermorelin, it went back to normal. So that's one reason I avoid sermorelin, at least, frequent use of sermorelin. PSA should be kept-- what-- below levels of somewhere between 1 and 4 is considered healthy? Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: It depends on the age. If there's a 20-year-old, likely between 0 and 1. If there's a 40-year-old, likely between 1 and 3. And then if there's an 80-year-old, it would not be abnormal to have a PSA of 5 and have that be well within the reference range. Another thing we should mention about PSA is if you do take a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride, often these will cut your PSA in half. So if you-- for example, if you have a PSA of 6 and you start finasteride or dutasteride, and then you recheck it in six months and it's 6.5, that is a huge concern, because that's actually doubled. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad you brought this up because I almost overlooked the fact that I get a lot of questions about drugs to offset hair loss. Most of those drugs are going to operate through the DHT system-- the dihydrotestosterone system-- for the reasons we talked about before. DHT receptors being on the scalp and causing beard growth on the face. Is it the case that a number of people taking things like Propecia and other things to block the DHT or disrupt the DHT pathway are going to experience diminished sex drive, diminished motivation and general vigor? And if, so are there alternatives like topical DHT antagonists that they might use if they want to keep their hair, but not have those negative effects? KYLE GILLETT: The way that I think about hair loss is you have your fertilizers, also known as growth agonist, and then you have your anti-androgens. Whether they're systemic or topical, there is both, but that's the general laymen's way to think about hair loss. If you're only putting fertilizer in your hair but you have androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness, then those hairs will still miniaturize, and eventually, you'll still have loss. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such a great word-- miniaturize. It's enough to send anybody off to find a therapeutic. KYLE GILLETT: And by the way, it's difficult to tell if miniaturization is happening unless you have a magnifying glass. And you can use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I almost didn't know-- for a second there, I didn't know whether or not you were making a joke. You're talking about miniaturization of the hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what can reverse that miniaturization? Gosh, it's just a fun word to say. I'm going to just keep saying it. KYLE GILLETT: Each individual has-- again, we mentioned the androgen receptor. Males only have one androgen receptor gene that's on their X chromosome. So depending on how sensitive that androgen receptor is and depending on the density of the receptors in the hair follicle, you can have an arbitrary threshold. And you don't know what this threshold is until you start to have miniaturization and loss of hair. But over the threshold, the follicle will die and eventually the stem cell will leave. But under the threshold, you're OK. Every androgen binds to the same androgen receptor. So there is nothing special about DHT. DHT is just a stronger androgen. So the higher your SHBG-- things that increase SHBG are beneficial for hair loss prevention because you have less binding of that receptor. So if you think about hair loss-- specifically, androgenic or male pattern baldness in the terms of that androgen receptor and everything in general binding to it-- not just DHT, but also testosterone-- it's helpful. It's just that DHT is a huge battering ram whereas the other androgens are just light presses on the door. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. So are some of the topical DHT receptor antagonists going to be a better choice for people that want to maintain their hair or grow more hair if they want to avoid side effects? KYLE GILLETT: Likely so. Some individuals benefit from systemic-- a systemic decrease in DHT for a couple of reasons. One could be prostate and then one could actually be hypertrophy of the myocardium. So DHT also disproportionately thickens the ventricle. So for someone on TRT, that might be a benefit that is prone to thickening of the ventricle at baseline. However, many people that have just a bit of predisposition, they can use things that are topical anti-androgens. Ketoconazole is one of them, caffeine is actually another one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wait-- drinking caffeine? KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I was going to say my hair tends to grow pretty fast, so it might be-- but I drink a lot of caffeine. So topical caffeine? Really, rubbing coffee on their head-- KYLE GILLETT: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or taking caffeine tablets-- and how does it-- wait, you have to explain how this works? How do people get caffeine into the hair follicle. KYLE GILLETT: Topically, the caffeine enters the scalp and crowds out-- somewhat crowds out the androgen. It is a weak effect. It's likely just strong enough to be clinically significant. Usually, caffeine is put into formulations with other things like ketoconazole that are also weak anti-androgens. Of note, spironolactone can be prescribed topically, but it is absorbed systemically because the size of the molecule. So unless your doctor specifically prescribes that for you, especially as a male, do not use topical spironolactone. Topical finasteride is also a smaller molecule, so it is also systemically absorbed, but it is not extremely well systemically absorbed. If you take topical finasteride, then usually your systemic DHT will decrease by about 30%. Topical dutasteride is likely a tiny bit systemically absorbed, but it's unique because it's half life is much faster at a lower dose. So topical dutasteride will not affect your systemic DHT at all, and I've seen this anecdotally on many people on topical dutasteride therapy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're going to have to get you back on here to do an episode all about DHT, and hair loss, and hair growth. Again, not a topic that I focus on a lot for myself, but that I get a lot of questions about from men and women. KYLE GILLETT: One thing that we could mention-- I got a ton of questions about turmeric and curcuminoids after the last episode. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah, I had reported my own anecdotal experience that taking turmeric really crushed my DHT levels and I did not feel good. I mean, it crushed all sorts of positive feelings of vitality. The moment I stopped taking turmeric, felt great again. KYLE GILLETT: Many people report this. And the interesting thing about turmeric is most of it's beneficial action-- not all of it-- some people benefit from systemic turmeric. And some people that can tolerate it-- well, it's actually great for the prostate. But most of the action, it does not need to be bioavailable. It acts on the gut microbiome. So you can take turmeric, and if it is not absorbed-- some turmeric is put in special formulations like micellar, or liposomal, or complexed. But a lot of it is put with black pepper fruit extract, which is also known as bioperine, which is actually also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and it affects liver cytochrome. And so many supplement companies put this black pepper fruit extract-- bioperine-- in almost everything. So some people are on really high doses, and that could also be making most of the effect of people who do not tolerate turmeric well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I avoid turmeric like the plague based on that one previous experience because it was clearly turmeric that caused the negative effect. Coming off it, everything reversed rapidly. And the bioperine-- the black pepper extract-- I also avoid that like the plague based on everything you just said. I want my 5-alpha reductase, I want my DHT to be optimized simply because my understanding is DHT is the more powerful androgen and it's the one that-- yes, it causes a little bit of hair loss and I've got a few patches here and there, but I'm willing to live with that based on all the other wonderful things that DHT optimization does. I'll quickly mention a few other things. One, saw palmetto is also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, but only a couple of the isoenzymes. There's three main isoenzymes, and a lot of the problem is that you're inhibiting a couple of the isoenzymes, but not the other one. Finasteride inhibits 1 and 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits all three. And finasteride inhibits the isoenzyme that is in genital skin, but not in the skin throughout the rest of your body. So a lot of the side effects of finasteride, which is loss of sensation and loss of erectile function, have to do with the disconcordance between the sensitivity of the genital skin and the skin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, another reason to not disrupt 5-alpha reductase. And we'll definitely get you back on here to talk about-- I think we should just do a whole episode about DHT, because so often when people are thinking about optimizing hormones, especially males trying to optimize their hormones, they're thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, they think a little bit more about free testosterone and maybe they think about estrogen as also being important-- not to crush estrogen. But DHT is, at least to my mind, the linchpin of so many of the things that subjectively people are really focused on-- libido, motivation, drive, et cetera. I have one final question-- it's just a brief one, but many of us have heard that the BPAs that are present in plastic bottles and even in certain aluminum cans and phthalates-- a difficult word to pronounce, but a fun one nonetheless-- phthalates-- and work by Dr. Shanna Swan has shown that phthalate exposure to the fetus-- to pregnant mothers and to fetuses very likely is negatively impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, and even changing genitalia size for the worse in males nowadays. I saw a beautiful lecture that Dr. Shanna Swan did on this when I was in Copenhagen. And it's very clear that it's negatively impacting the male fetus. She was also on Joe Rogan's podcast. I hope to get her on this podcast. However, what she couldn't answer for me was whether or not phthalates, and BPAs, and these things present in plastics, and some people claim in tap water, are bad for males after they're born and after puberty. What are your thoughts on-- or I should just ask you, do you drink water out of plastic bottles? Do you avoid drinking out of cans that are not specifically non-BPA containing cans? And do you actively avoid phthalates? My understanding is that phthalates are most enriched in pesticides, and that's why you're seeing dramatic drops in sperm and testosterone levels mainly in rural areas where they're dust cropping. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah. So I do avoid drinking out of cans that-- or plastics that may have BPA or bisphenol A in them. Bisphenol A is known to bind to what I would consider the fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma. So it I would consider it a xenoestrogen. So phytoestrogens are estrogens from plants, and in general, they're not concerning or clinically significant. And xenoestrogens are just other estrogens. So I do avoid BPA and I also test my water. I use a water testing service and I test it both after it's through my water filter and the tap water that my two boys drink almost every day. And it's very interesting. I only found one microplastic just a bit over the reference range, so it wasn't a terrible tap score. But even in developed countries, these are widely variable. As far as phthalates, again, very difficult and interesting to pronounce, but I remember learning about these because there is I believe a lawsuit that had to do with mac and cheese. And this was probably five years ago, and I was coming up with my list of-- each provider that does obstetrics has a list what to avoid for the pregnant lady. Sketchy deli meats or high mercury fish like swordfish and salmon, and I actually added processed mac and cheese to that list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. Well, thank you for that. I'm going to extract your statement that you avoid drinking out of plastic bottles when possible. I'm guessing you're not neurotically attached to that. If you were dying of thirst, you might crack a plastic bottle of water to survive. But listen, Kyle-- Dr. Gillett-- thank you so much. You gave us an enormous wealth of knowledge, everything from behaviors, to psychology, to supplementation, to prescription drugs. We will make sure to point out where people can get a hold of you on Instagram, and on Twitter, and on other websites in our show note captions.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an ask me anything or AMA episode, which is part of our premium subscriber content. Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which still comes out once a week, every Monday, and of course is zero cost to consumer. The premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future. If you'd like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium. And there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year. We also have a lifetime subscriber option. For those of you that are already Huberman Lab podcast Premium subscribers and you're watching and or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium podcast feed. And for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab Premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode and hopefully that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber. Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible. The first question is about how to improve sleep. In particular, how to improve deep sleep that is sometimes called slow-wave sleep. This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard and they got a lot of up votes. Now, we've done multiple full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep, including the Master Your Sleep episode and Perfect Your Sleep episode, as well as a toolkit that is available completely zero cost at hubermanlab.com. It's a downloadable PDF that lists out the behavioral tools and other tools that you can implement to improve your sleep. Now Jack's question is specifically about how to improve deep sleep. He asks, I have a sleep analyzer and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep, that is rapid eye movement sleep. For him, he says it's 30% of his total sleep is rapid eye movement sleep. But he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%, and I would like to know if there are any science-backed protocols I can use to specifically increase my deep sleep. Okay, so for those of you that may not know what is deep sleep. Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep, that is slow-wave sleep and deep sleep are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the same thing. They aren't necessarily the same thing, but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella. What is that mechanistic umbrella? Well, when you go to sleep at night, you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep. And in the early part of the night, I would say in the first half of your night or so, most of your sleep is going to be slow-wave deep sleep. But then as you transition into the second half of your night, more of your sleep will be rapid eye movement sleep. Now that's the typical pattern that is observed when you're not disrupting your sleep architecture with things like caffeine and alcohol. We'll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes. Deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep, at least for sake of this conversation, is vitally important in particular for repair of bodily tissues. During deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone and in fact you secrete growth hormone every night when you go to sleep. But most of that growth hormone release is restricted to the first half of your sleep night. The other feature of deep sleep is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep tend to be of a less emotional nature than the sorts of dreams that one experiences in rapid eye movement sleep. So just to give a broad top contour of what deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep is really about, it tends to occur in the first half of the night, it also occurs in the second half of the night, but in the first half of the night, most of your sleep is going to be occupied by deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep. It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired in part by release of growth hormone, which is involved in metabolism, but also protein synthesis, muscle repair, repair of all cell types and tissues. And during deep sleep, your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane, sometimes a little bizarre, but typically not very emotionally loaded. That can change if you're dealing with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances in your waking life, but in general, the sleep and dreams that occur in the first part of the night is deep and it's not terribly emotionally ridden. Your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism. Now, this relates to recent findings just this last year in which researchers monitored the output of people's breath and the various metabolic factors present in the breath as well as through blood draws, So basically doing all this while people are asleep in a laboratory. And they observe that during the first half of the night while people are in deep sleep, their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently than it does in the second half of the night. I'll come back to this in a little while, but this turns out to be very important for establishing your metabolism and the way you regulate insulin and blood glucose during the daytime. So all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep, slow-wave sleep, is vitally important. And Jack's asking how he can increase the amount of deep sleep that he's getting because by his sleep tracking method, he's observing far less deep sleep than rapid eye movement sleep. Now that raises the question of how much deep sleep one should be getting overall. In general, the goal should be to balance the total amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the night. However, I would not want people to obsess over getting exactly 30% rapid eye movement sleep and exactly 30% slow-wave sleep. Your body is much more resilient than that, but the closer those two numbers are to one another, the better overall architecture of your sleep. And he doesn't list out exactly how he's measuring his sleep so I do want to put an asterisk on both the question and the answer I provide by stating that a lot of sleep trackers, whether or not they are WHOOP trackers or Ouras or whether or not you're using a mattress based or mattress cover based sleep tracker like Eight Sleep or other, is using heart rate and heart rate variability and body movement to estimate or to kind of predict whether or not you're in slow-wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. And that's because during rapid eye movement sleep, you tend to be in what's called atonia, you tend to be paralyzed, you can't move. And during slow-wave sleep, that's not the case. But no matter what the sleep tracking method is, if it's a standard commercial sleep tracking method, WHOOP or Eight Sleep, et cetera, it is an estimate or a best guess at what stage of sleep you're in. Whereas when you go into a sleep laboratory, like the sleep laboratory at Stanford, at University of Pennsylvania or other of the great sleep laboratories that are out there, they're going to use other methods including EEG and EMG. These are just acronyms that refer to ways to record brainwaves. They actually are going to try and observe for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera. So sleep trackers give you a best guess as to what stage of sleep you're in. They are not perfectly accurately, at least none of the commercially available sleep trackers are perfectly accurate. So we do want to highlight that. Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly, which is how to increase the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Well, there are a couple ways. First of all are the don'ts and then we'll talk about the dos. Two things that you can do to really disrupt your slow-wave sleep are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime or even at all. Some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow-wave sleep and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep that they get at night is reduced and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted. This has been shown again and again. Likewise, avoiding caffeine within eight and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable. And if you're not a caffeine drinker, obviously you don't have to worry about this at all, but avoiding caffeine intake within that 8 to 12 hours of bedtime will greatly assist in you getting more slow-wave sleep and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep. This has been shown again and again. And as well avoiding cannabis use and maybe even CBD use within 8 to 12 hours of sleep can be very beneficial if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep. Now, I know a lot of people rely on alcohol, cannabis and CBD in order to get into sleep. However, it's been shown many times in human studies, and this was discussed in the podcast episode that we did with the great Matt Walker, who's a professor of neuroscience and psychology at University of California, Berkeley, and a world expert in sleep and sleep science. Matt and I discussed the research showing that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, even though cannabis can help you fall asleep, and even though CBD can help people fall asleep, that it does disrupt and in many ways reduce the quality of sleep that one gets. So that's disappointing news I know for a number of the people that rely on cannabis, CBD, or alcohol to fall asleep, but I would encourage you to check out the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast that we did about alcohol and about cannabis, including some of the health benefits of cannabis in certain situations, but also some of the detrimental effects of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations in particular for improving slow-wave sleep. So that's actually three major don'ts. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis, and let's put under the umbrella of cannabis, THC and CBD in the 8 and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep if your goal is to improve the total amount of slow-wave sleep that you're getting and your overall sleep architecture. In addition, it's well known that avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep is going to greatly assist in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve during the early stages of the night and the depth and duration of slow-wave sleep. Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement by saying if you go to sleep too hungry, it can also disrupt your sleep. So you're going to have to arrange your eating schedule and your sleeping schedule such that you're not eating too close to bedtime, but you're also not going to bed so hungry that you can't fall asleep or that you don't get into deep sleep and stay asleep. I can personally attest to the fact that if I'm too hungry, I can't fall asleep. Now for me, most nights I'm going to eat dinner sometime between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM depending on time of year, schedules, what's going on, traffic, et cetera. And I tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM plus or minus an hour, again, depending on time of year and what else is going on in life. So I normally have that buffer of two hours or so before going to sleep. However, there are some nights where even if I eat dinner around 7:00 PM, I'm quite hungry at 9:00 PM and I want to go to sleep. In that case, eating a small amount of food, ought not to disrupt your slow-wave sleep too much, but you do want to avoid eating large meals right before going to sleep unless, unless completely fasting and not eating something late at night will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all. In other words, it's better to make sure that you're getting to sleep than it is to avoid food just so that you get increased growth hormone output and into slow-wave sleep. I hope that's clear. You know, I have had times in my life where I'm working very, very hard and I missed dinner or something comes up and I know some people can fall asleep quite easily on an empty stomach. I've been able to do that, in particular if I'm very exhausted. I also rely on a handful of supplements to fall asleep each night, although I've not dependent on them. There have been times when I haven't been able to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep. But the point is that you don't want to be so hungry that you can't fall asleep. And yet in an ideal circumstance, especially if you're trying to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, you would avoid food in the two hours or so before going to sleep. If you can avoid food for the three or four hours prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily, that's even better for sake of increasing slow-wave sleep and growth hormone output. Now, there are some additional tools for improving slow-wave sleep, in particular, the transitions between slow-wave sleep and the other sleep stages because even though, as I mentioned earlier, the early part of your night is occupied primarily by slow-wave sleep, all night long you're transitioning from slow-wave sleep into an intermediate stage of sleep and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again. It's just that in the early part of the night, more of that time is going to be occupied by slow-wave sleep. The two ways to improve slow-wave sleep that are well documented in the literature, and here we can point to some really nice papers that I'll reference in case you want to read further, is the first one is entitled, Exercise Improves the Quality of Slow-Wave Sleep by Increasing Slow-Wave Stability. Slow-wave Stability has to do with, as researchers call it, the amount of power present in the different aspects of slow-wave sleep, So this gets a little bit technical, but this is an instance in which they brought subjects into the laboratory, they measured brainwaves by EEG, they had some other measurements as well included in subjective measures of sleep, and they looked at whether or not people were doing exercise or not prior to sleep. Now, when I say prior to sleep, I mean not within six hours prior to bedtime. In fact, exercising intensely in the six hours prior to bedtime, for many people, not all, but for many people can disrupt the total amount of slow-wave sleep that they get and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep. So the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward. It was a randomized crossover trial. Basically, they had people either sleeping and monitoring their sleep or they had people doing an hour of exercise at 60% of their so-called VO2 max, you can look this up, for 60 minutes. 60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity. It's breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard. If we were going to map that to the so-called zone, zone 2 cardio being the kind of cardio you can do steady state while holding a conversation. This would be somewhere in the probably zone 3 or zone 4, although that's not exactly what 60% of VO2 Max is going to map to every time. Think about relatively challenging cardiovascular output for 60 minutes, and they had them do that at least six hours prior to bedtime, and, this is an important and, They did have the subjects in this study in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol, so that's very important. And what they observed was an enhancement of slow-wave sleep. So exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form of improving slow-wave sleep. Now, I do not know, because the study as far as I know has not been done, whether or not doing resistance training or some other type of exercise would've led to the same effect, although I have to imagine that if it's moderately intense to intense resistance training provided it's done far enough away from going to sleep prior to six hours before sleep, that one ought to see the same effects. Although that was not a condition in this study. But it's a very nice study. They looked at everything from changes in core body temperature to caloric expenditure. They didn't see huge changes in core body temperature changes, so that couldn't explain the effect. It really appears that the major effect of improving slow-wave sleep was due to something in changing the fine structure of the brain waves that occur during slow-wave sleep. In fact, and this is an important point, the subjects in this study did not report subjectively feeling that much better from their sleep. So you might say, well then why would I even want to bother? However, it's well known that getting sufficient slow-wave sleep is important not just for repair, excuse me, for repair of bodily tissues, but also for repair of brain tissues and repair and wash out of debris in the brain. And that debris is known to lead to things like dementia. So getting the best quality slow-wave sleep is extremely important for body and for brain. And getting an hour of exercise that's moderately intense and making sure that you're not doing that exercise within the six hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime, but I would say in the 8 to 12 hours prior to bedtime would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all, or I know there are people out there that don't drink caffeine at all, I'm not one of those people, but restricting that caffeine intake to the very early part of the day, that has been shown to improve the quality and the overall architecture of sleep and slow-wave sleep in particular. That's really what this study points to. There's another tool that can improve the amount and quality of slow-wave sleep that you achieve at night. This is actually a tool that I've started using over the last six to eight months or so. As many of you know, I believe in getting behaviors right before embracing changes in supplementation or prescription drugs. Behavioral tools consist of dos and don'ts, and the dos and don'ts for sleep are well documented in the Master Sleep episode and the Perfect Your Sleep episode and the toolkit for sleep. They include getting morning sunlight in your eyes or bright light of other kinds, avoiding bright light from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM, et cetera, et cetera. All that information is in the toolkit for sleep and those other full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast. Now, there are supplements that can greatly improve the depth of your sleep and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep. And here I'm not referring to melatonin, as many of you perhaps already know, I'm not a fan of melatonin for a variety of reasons, mainly the fact that most melatonin supplements out there don't actually contain the exact amount of melatonin that's listed on the bottle. They contain either much, much more or much, much less. And that melatonin is a potent hormone that has impacts on not just sleep, but on other hormone systems as well. The supplements that I've suggested and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep are magnesium threonate, spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E. And interchangeably with that one could use magnesium bisglycinate. I do consider those interchangeable because both cross into cells and cross the blood brain barrier in much the same way that makes them better candidates for improving sleep than some of the other forms of magnesium. So magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, and something called apigenin, which is essentially what you find in camomile that is the reason why camomile can make you sleepy. A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin. The dosages for those et cetera are described in the toolkit for sleep and why some people might want to avoid theanine. I'll just tell you, for those of you that have very intense dreams or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors, you might want to avoid theanine because it can enhance the kind of emotional and elaborate nature of dreams. Other people like that. So I'll take magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin as a so-called sleep stack about 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep. I do not take them during the day. There is, however, another supplement that used in combination with the sleep stack that I just described or alone can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep. And in particular, people who are following a low carbohydrate diet who have trouble falling and staying asleep seem to benefit from it, and that is so-called inositol. Now, inositol comes in different forms, but the form that I'm referring to here in terms of enhancing slow-wave sleep is myo-inositol. There are an enormous number of studies on inositol for sake of mental health and for sake of enhancing various aspects of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep. I'd like to just highlight one paper, title of this paper will make it clear what it's about. The title of the paper is The Impact of Myo-Inositol Supplementation on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Study. Now, as I just told you, the study was carried out on pregnant women, but there have been other studies of inositol on other populations. And the major takeaway from these studies is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep and can adjust the architecture of sleep in ways that make it a great candidate for improving the structure and maybe also the duration of slow-wave sleep in particular. I find that if I'm following a lower carbohydrate diet, which I do from time to time, I sometimes have trouble falling asleep. Or if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime, then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime. And sometimes if I'm exercising very hard or if I'm working a lot, even if I eat dinner around seven and I go to sleep around 10:00 PM, I might be a little bit hungry still at 10:00 PM. In that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol in addition to the other sleep stack that I just described greatly enhances my ability to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep. I do monitor my sleep. I do that two ways. I do that these days with my Eight Sleep sleep tracker, and I use a WHOOP sleep tracker when I sleep. The combination of those two taps into different aspects of sleep tracking, heart rate variability, movement, et cetera. In a future episode, we'll talk about what are the best devices for monitoring sleep, which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages. But I certainly see it in the objective data that is from the sleep tracking data. And I also observe subjectively that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep, again 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep, can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep and for me to stay asleep throughout the night. I also noticed another effect, which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, which I often do, I find it much easier to fall back asleep. I don't tend to get into kind of looping thought and things of that sort in the middle of the night. And that may relate to the fact that myo-inositol has been studied in many cases for its role in controlling anxiety that is for reducing anxiety. And that's one of the reasons, in fact, one of many reasons why people take myo-inositol during the daytime. There are studies of myo-inositol for dealing with anxiety, for sleep as we're discussing now, and even for improving fertility and things of that sort, in particular in women. So again, 900 milligrams of an inositol can be a useful tool. 60 minutes of exercise, as described previously, can be a tool, and certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Jack had a second part to his question, he asked is having a high level of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower level of deep sleep likely to cause any health issues? And to be honest, it's not really clear that it would cause any specific health issues, although if we think about what the specific roles of slow-wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are, again, rapid eye movement sleep being laden with highly emotional dreams, It's thought to act as a sort of trauma release where people are paralyzed in body and that's a healthy paralysis, they're so-called sleep atonia, but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff within their dreams, and there is a lack of ability for the body to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep, that's thought to be important for emotional repair, if you will, during the night. Certainly studies where people have been deprived of rapid eye movement sleep have shown that their ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduced. Certainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep for multiple nights, that's going to be the case. The only caveat to that is that there are certain forms of treating depression that involve specifically depriving people of rapid eye movement sleep. That's a whole other story that was covered in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams. So if you want to learn more as to why that's the case, check out that episode. But because slow-waves sleep, which occurs again during the early part of the night, is when growth hormones is released and when there's this periodic washout of debris within the brain, and to some extent within certain tissues of the body, you could imagine that reduced low-wave sleep would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise, from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system. However, I am personally not aware of any studies that specifically looked at the ratio of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, and that focused in particular on reduced slow-wave sleep for bodily repair. Those studies might be out there, I was not able to find them. If you are able to find them, please put them in the comment section and I would love to check out those studies. So I don't think that one needs to be overly concerned if you're not getting a balance of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, that's perfect. However, and as I mentioned earlier, it would be good to strive to try and balance the amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night. If you think about it, that will also tell you whether or not you're getting sufficient total sleep. And I don't want to open up another set of questions here as I'm about to close out an answer to this question, but I do often get asked the question whether or not four hours is enough, or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough. Well, it's impossible to know exactly how much sleep each individual person needs. And of course, each individual person will need a different amount of total sleep depending on the amount of stress and physical strain and various other things they're dealing with in their daily waking life. However, it's generally the case that kids and people that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy need more sleep than adults do. So as you age, you do in fact need less sleep. One good metric of whether or not you are getting enough sleep is whether or not you're sleepy during the daytime or not. If you're falling asleep a lot during the daytime, you're probably not getting enough sleep at night. That's sort of a duh, but it's an important duh to pay attention to. And for those of us, like myself, that need a 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great. That doesn't necessarily mean you're not getting enough sleep at night. So if you get sleepy enough to want a nap in the afternoon, that's not an indication necessarily that you are not getting enough sleep at night. However, if you're only sleeping four or five hours per night, it's very hard to imagine that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours and certainly 8 to 10 hours per night, the probability that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep greatly increases. So if I were to throw out a number, I would say for most people, that is for 95% of people out there, getting at least six hours of sleep per night, at least, and ideally more like seven or eight is going to be the goal. However, I've noticed, for instance, for myself, unless I'm exercising extremely intensely or I'm going through a lot of emotional or physical stress in my daily life, getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night allows me to feel really good and refreshed throughout the day. And that's especially the case if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon or use NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest. So I hope that answers your question, Jack, and there are, of course, I'm extending the answer to all others who upvoted that question or who might be interested in improving their slow-wave sleep. There are some dos, there are some don'ts that I just described. I suggest trying various things one by one to see what works best for you so you don't necessarily need to leap to doing the 60 minutes of exercise plus the inositol, et cetera. However, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol and caffeine within the 8 to 12 hours prior to sleep. And again, if you're not using either of those, that would be even better, at least in terms of sleep architecture. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything Sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and Premium Tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium Channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the Premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast 101
Published: 2022-12-05 13:00:31 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how to use caffeine to enhance mental and physical health and performance, including the optimal dosages and intake schedules for caffeine. I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing caffeine. Caffeine is one of the most widely used substances on the planet. Estimates are that more than 90% of adults and as many as 50% of kids that is adolescents and teenagers use caffeine on a daily basis. Caffeine is an amazing molecule. Most people are familiar with caffeine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue. And indeed, it does that. But what most people are not aware of is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer. What I mean by reinforcer is that, when caffeine is present in a drink or food-- and yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods even unbeknownst to us. When it's present in drinks and foods, we actively come to like those foods and drinks more than if caffeine were not contained in those foods and drinks. So it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks. And indeed, it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine. That is, caffeine is not just a stimulant. Caffeine is a reinforcer. And it's a reinforcer that plays an active role in almost everybody's daily life. We can say that with confidence because, as I mentioned a moment ago, more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine. And most people think that they consume caffeine because it makes them feel more alert. But there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine. And I'm not going to tell you that consuming caffeine is necessarily bad. In fact, today, I'm going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine, including neuroprotective effects, antidepressive effects, and certainly performance-enhancing effects, both for mental performance and for physical performance. Now that said, there are certain situations in which you want to avoid caffeine, and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine. That's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine not just as a stimulant but as a reinforcer. In fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that, if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present in certain foods and drinks, you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks over other choices, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what sorts of food and drink choices you're trying to make. So today, I'm going to inform you about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level. I promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature and such that, even if you don't have a background in biology, you will be able to digest that information easily. And then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage or conversely how to avoid caffeine at certain times to your advantage. So today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of caffeine to improve mental health, physical health, and performance. Before we go any further into today's discussion, I want to tell you about some recent results about a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated beverages and that has been proven to be very useful for both weight loss, mental performance, and controlling blood sugar levels. And that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide 1. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is found in the brain and body. It acts both on the brain and body. It does many different things. But one of its primary effects that's been discovered is to reduce hunger. And it does that in two ways. It does that by activating certain neurons in your hypothalamus. So that's a brain region that controls hunger and satiety. It makes us feel full at the level of the brain, so it makes us feel sated, that is. And it actually makes us feel full. It turns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if we've ingested enough food. It doesn't necessarily make us feel as if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full. That's really interesting because, if you think about it, when we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously. And that information has to be communicated to the brain such that the brain can then send satiety signals that actually shut off our hunger. And believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals to reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full. And GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain to create these feelings of satiety as if we've had enough and to reduce our desire to eat more. And GLP-1 acts directly on the gut to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut, which then is communicated to the brain. So really, there are two parallel signals being sent when we have GLP-1 present in our system. Now a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1. It was actually discovered in Gila monsters. These are these reptiles that can go long periods of time without eating. And a very clever scientist decided to study why it is that certain animals like Gila monsters can go a long period of time without ingesting anything. And it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1. They isolate the peptide from GLP-1, then they looked for the analogous peptide in humans. And it turns out that does exist. And as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated. Why am I telling you all this? Well, today we're going to talk about caffeine. And there's one particular caffeine source, which is yerba maté, and there are some other forms of teas similar to yerba mate that stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly. There are also nowadays drugs which are called analogues of GLP-1. So these are drugs that mimic or are identical to the kind of GLP-1 that you would make. And those drugs are proven to be very effective for the treatment of certain forms of diabetes and for the treatment of obesity, but they trigger enormous amounts of GLP-1 pathway activation. So those are extreme cases for people that are really struggling for weight loss. But the clinical trials and the data that are out there in the general population now are very, very promising for GLP-1 analogues. Yerba maté tea, provided it's not the smoked variety-- and I mention that because a number of people have cued me to the fact that yerba maté teas come in smoked varieties and nonsmoked varieties. And the smoked varieties are thought to perhaps be carcinogenic. That is, procancer-causing. So I advise people to avoid smoked varieties of yerba maté tea. But yerba maté teas are known to stimulate significant amounts of GLP-1 release. And so they can be effective as a weight loss tool, mainly by blunting appetite. And again, they do that both at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut. Now all of what I just told you has been known for some period of time, but there are new set of findings that were just published in Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Press journal, excellent journal-- which indicate exactly how it is that GLP-1 stimulates both satiety and can trigger additional weight loss through other mechanisms. And I find the mechanism to be really interesting and actually really important, given some other topics we've covered on this podcast before. So the basic finding is that GLP-1, whether or not it's stimulated through the release of analogue drug that one is prescribed or by drinking yerba maté tea, for instance, and stimulate release of your own so-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes you feel more full at the level of brain and body. But it turns out it also stimulates thermogenesis. Now thermogenesis is the active utilization of more metabolic energy. And fat cells, in particular-- so-called beige and brown fat cells-- are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body. The basic background is that you have white adipose cells, so white fat cells. You have beige fat cells, and you have brown fat cells. And the beige and brown ones are fat cells that you actually want more of. They are not abundant under your skin. They're abundant really around your clavicles and your upper neck. They are the ones that generate heat. And the beige and brownness of them is actually the consequence of having a lot of mitochondria in those cells. When GLP-1 is elevated in your system, it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells and helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells. That is, it takes fat cells that are not doing anything useful for you except being stored energy. And I think most people out there would like to have fewer of those white adipose cells. There are few of you out there that actually need more of them that are too thin, too lean, but most people are suffering from having too many of these white adipose cells. Well, when you ingest yerba maté tea or you were to take a GLP-1 analogue or stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways, yes, you stimulate increased satiety, but you're also stimulating the conversion of these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells, which makes you more thermogenic and over time raises your basal metabolic rate. So you're burning more calories even at rest. It also makes you feel as if you're more comfortable in colder environments at rest. This is very much the same as the mechanism that's induced when you were to, say, take a cold shower or do regular ice baths or get into cold water regularly. That, too, stimulates the conversion of white fat cells to beige and brown fat cells. So I like these findings very much because they provide a mechanistic coherence. They provide that is a really nice story as to how something like GLP-1 could be so effective for weight loss. Yes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite, and that, of course, will help people maintain or lose weight. But it's also increasing basal metabolic rate. And we now know how that's accomplished. It's likely accomplished at least through this one mechanism by the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells, which don't do much for us except as energy storage units to these metabolically mitochondrial-rich beige and brown fat cells, which you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle that allows your furnace, your metabolism to burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate. So that's the mechanism. And the basic tool takeaway is that, if you are somebody who's interested in losing weight and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway, drinking a cup or two of yerba maté tea early in the day would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release. There are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release. You can get it through certain forms of exercise. In particular, fasted exercise. This is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise. There's a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio burns more fat than nonfasted cardio. And the data basically say no, it doesn't really matter. But that doesn't really take into account the longer arc of things like GLP-1 release, so that needs to be taken into consideration. So you could do fasted cardio. You could drink yerba maté tea, keeping in mind that yerba maté tea does contain caffeine. We'll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants including caffeine that maté has. But maté would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release. And then, of course, for those of you that are interested in more robust activation of GLP-1, then perhaps you might want to consider some of the new prescription GLP-1 analogues that are out there. But that's a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course. And for everybody, regardless of whether or not you're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight, I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about GLP-1 analogues and drinks and supplements and things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1 in the very near future because it does appear to be a very important biological mechanism. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. The blood glucose or blood sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate and long-term health and, indeed, your feelings of vigor and mental clarity and well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know how different foods and food combinations and timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels, you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels, and what it taught me, for instance, was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me, for instance, how to space my exercise and my food intake. Turns out for me exercising fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I learned using Levels, and it's completely transformed not just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise but also use of things like the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous learning for me that's really shaped an enormous number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical strength and endurance. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Again, that's levels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity. I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we wake up in the morning, that is in large part because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different core body temperatures, and they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday Bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 Cover.

ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford. And everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system. And I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly, for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or often to the distance. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly, so you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling. And indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time I can't even remember that they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that, while they can be used during sports activities, they also have a terrific aesthetic, and they can be used just as well for wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA. That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order.

And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. Let's talk about caffeine. So as I mentioned earlier, caffeine is consumed by basically most all adults every single day and consumed at very regular times each day. In fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake or the caffeine intake of somebody close to you, what you would realize is that they don't do so well if their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, or 30 minutes past their expected or usual intake of caffeine. That's pretty remarkable, and it brings to mind ideas that we are all, quote unquote, "addicted to caffeine" or that caffeine is somehow bad. I'm certainly not going to make the argument that caffeine is bad. First of all, I'm a regular caffeine user. I wouldn't call myself a caffeine abuser, but I am a regular caffeine user. And caffeine is known to have certain health benefits. I listed off a few of them earlier, but I'll mention those again now before going forward. Caffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects. And that is because of its ability to increase neuromodulators, such as dopamine, but also other so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine. If you don't know what those names mean, these are molecules that increase levels of alertness, motivation, and drive. And so then therefore not surprisingly the large scale analyses of the relationship between depression and caffeine shows that, provided people are not drinking so much caffeine, that it makes them overly anxious, that regular intake of caffeine is inversely related to levels of depression. So it may have some antidepressant effects. And those could be direct or indirect. What do I mean by that? Well, you can imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine and they are more motivated to do work and pursue quality social interactions, then the probability that they will have depression could be lower. It could also be that there are direct effects on the chemical systems of the brain that relate to mood and well-being that could offset depression. It is not clear whether or not the effects of caffeine in countering depression are direct or indirect. Nonetheless, there's a relationship there, and it's an interesting and positive one. Or I should say negative correlation, positive effect overall on mood and well-being, to be exact. Now it's also the case that caffeine can improve mental performance and physical performance. This has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies. I will review a few studies on this, in particular, today. But to just give you a sense of how caffeine works at the level of its timing and impact on mental performance and physical performance, when we ingest caffeine, provided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach and that our blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, we experience an increase in alertness within about five minutes. And that increase in focus and alertness peaks around 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine and persists for as long as 60 minutes. Now this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form or drinks the entire caffeine drink within a short period of time. But a little bit later, I'll talk about how you can consume caffeine at regular intervals while doing mental work or physical work in a way that can further increase mental performance and physical performance. But let's just touch on what caffeine intake really does for mental performance and physical performance. Perhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies that I've examined is that caffeine reduces our reaction time. That is, it improves our reaction time. It doesn't make it longer. It makes it shorter. So for instance, in a laboratory study where people were asked to hit a lever every time they hear a tone, you can greatly reduce the time between the tone and the pressing of the lever if people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes before they do that task. Now that seems like a trivial task, but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance and even in cognitive performance, where people have to arrive at a particular answer to a question. And the answer to that question has to be pulled from their memory banks within their brain, their hippocampus, for instance, a brain structure involved in memory. And if you are asking people, for instance, to remember the capitals of different states or cities or to remember certain historical facts, they will do that at a particular rate. But if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior, their ability to recall that information is much, much better. They are faster, and it does not appear that accuracy is reduced. In fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced. And that's because caffeine both works on the reaction time systems of the brain and body. I'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit. But it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters and so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body that give the neural circuits in the brain that are associated with learning and memory a lower threshold to activation. What does that mean? That means that we are better able to access the brain circuitry involved in learning and memory when we have a certain amount of caffeine circulating in our system. So this makes caffeine an incredible performance-enhancing compound. And I could give you tens of thousands of examples of this in humans. But before I do that, I want to just touch on what we know about the existence of caffeine in nature and what the existence of caffeine in nature and its effects on other animals tells us about what caffeine does in humans. Because as I alluded to earlier, what caffeine is doing for us is not just making us more alert, improving our memory, improving our reaction time, and so on. It's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience. And it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer of the caffeine-containing drink that we drink but also the mug that it's contained in, plus the person that we might be sitting across from when we consume that caffeine, and so on and so forth. If it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize what a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer, let me spell it out in three specific ways. We often hear about the word reward, and we think, OK, if we do certain things and we like the outcome, then those certain things are rewarded. Right? If we're doing something, we receive praise. The praise is the reward. And therefore, we are more likely to do that thing in the future. In fact, a lot of parenting is like that. And a lot of life is like that. However, when we hear the word reward, we often think about something that feels good to us. And certainly, if we've worked hard and we get some praise, that's natural for the praise to feel good to us. Or for instance, if we work very hard and we get a certain outcome-- a trophy, a financial outcome, a degree outcome, recognition, et cetera-- all of those can act as rewards, but those are all conscious rewards. We are aware that they are happening. Reinforcers are a little bit different because the word reinforcement can apply to conscious rewards of the sort that I just described, but there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers. But those reinforcers are subconscious. That is, we are not aware that they cause this preference for the activities that cause their release. So the study I'm about to describe beautifully, I believe, encapsulates how is it that humans came to consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in nature and the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent both in animals, insects, and in you and me. And the title of the paper is "Caffeine and floral nectar enhances a pollinator's memory of reward." Keep in mind that caffeine is made from plants. Some of you will say, duh, but I think some of us don't realize that the reason why there is caffeine in coffee is because coffee comes from a plant. It's a coffee bean, certain teas, which, of course, are plants that people brew. Caffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba maté. Well, why would this bitter substance-- because, in fact, caffeine is quite bitter in high concentrations. Why would this bitter substance be something that insects or animals would want to consume at all? It turns out that, in most plants, caffeine is present in small enough quantities that insects and other animals-- and in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine. If I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine, yes, it would be a stimulant for you, but you would say that it tasted awful. It's in a category of compounds that would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors on your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker and essentially walk away from whatever it is that contain that caffeine and from the experience that contain that caffeine. Well, in nature, caffeine is present in very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors within flowers, beans, and plants. And what this paper really points to is that caffeine in nature is acting as a reinforcer for bees that are consuming different nectar. So the way that it works is that bees, of course, go from flower to flower, and they are consuming the nectar. They are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive, and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony. The bees are foraging in a way that includes information about color, in particular, ultraviolet color, things that we can't see but they can see, because they have different photoreceptors than we do. And what the study shows is that plants and nectars that contain very small amounts of caffeine are the preferred sources of food for bees. And the study is beautiful because they were able to confirm that they could mask the caffeine taste. So they know that the bees are not preferring the taste of caffeine. But what they do is they pair caffeine with different food sources for the bees, then they remove the caffeine. And what they find is that the bees very strongly prefer flavors that contain caffeine, not because they could taste the caffeine but rather for the way that those caffeine-containing flavors made the bees feel. So how do those caffeine-containing flavors make the bees feel? The same way that they make you and I feel, a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work. For the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food, which then has a further reinforcing effect. So what we're really talking about here is the fact that A, caffeine exists in nature, in plants. It exists in concentrations that are very low, so low, in fact, that they are not detectable to the taste receptors of insects, and, in many cases, to the taste receptors of humans. And, of course, there can be high levels of caffeine in a plant. But if the plant also contains compounds that mask the flavor of caffeine, well then, those plants are going to essentially be even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant, OK? So now we're talking about strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine. And the most important point here is that all of these effects of caffeine are subconscious. It is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine. In fact, most people, when they take their first sip of coffee, they find it taste bitter and kind of noxious. They don't like it. You may not even remember that because it happened so long ago and because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee. You might even come to like the feeling of your mug in your hand. You might even come to like the smell of coffee and so on and so forth. And that's because caffeine stimulates the release of certain neurochemicals in the brain, in particular, dopamine and acetylcholine, two neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness and our feelings of well-being. A little bit later, I'll tell you that caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine in a way that's very much distinct from the classical dopamine pathway associated with addiction and reward. In fact, we can think of caffeine as having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems. I'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going. Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and acetylcholine not within the classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. That's just fancy nerd speak for the reward pathways of the brain. They're associated with things like sex and food and drugs of abuse, like cocaine and methamphetamine. But rather, caffeine seems to stimulate the release of dopamine in the parts of the brain that are associated with alertness and cognition, meaning the forebrain. This is very important. We have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body, and caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine directly within the components of the brain that are associated with clarity of thought and well-being, but more so clarity of thought. Now, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer in that it makes you feel good overall. And it does. And that suggests that it also taps into the more classic reward pathway. But it does that in a very interesting and frankly almost diabolical way. When we regularly ingest caffeine, it stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors at multiple sites throughout the brain but, in particular, within the reward pathways of the brain. So not the areas of the brain that are associated with focus and clarity of thought and cognition. It does that, but it is also increasing the level of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway. And what that means is that, for any dopamine that's released in response to a positive experience, social experience, or any number of the other things that can stimulate dopamine release, there are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will, for that dopamine to arrive at and to exert its increases in mood, increases in motivation, and overall feelings of drive and excitement. So there are four ways that caffeine works that we need to understand. First of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent. It increases the probability that you will return to and engage in a certain activity or consume a certain beverage or food. Second of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine, which are both neuromodulators in the forebrain, which helps us improve our ability to think, to modify our rule sets. That is, to adjust our strategies for different social situations and mental demands and physical demands. And third, it increases the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain. That is, it makes things that would feel pretty good feel even better. And fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine, which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the accumulation of adenosine that occurs as we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day. So let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent. Again, this was first most beautifully demonstrated in this study on honeybees where the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine. And that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology of bees and flowers that contain nectar. There's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation, that the flower benefits because of distribution of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers and the bees benefit, because they're getting food. And so there's a kind of a symbiosis there. But with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing beverages for our sake. I don't think we have it in mind, nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly, that we're trying to preserve the plants that provide the caffeine. I think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants were gone, certainly. But most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and caffeine-containing foods because we're thinking about the plants they come from and we want to help those plants. We're thinking about how we want to help ourselves. And yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine are that they are largely subconscious. We are not aware of them. Now you might say, no, that's not true. When I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good. So I'm aware that it makes me feel good. In order to illustrate how reinforcement really works, let me give you the counter example, which would be an aversive agent. So we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents. Let's say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive. And indeed, they are. And let's say that these compounds were present at such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them. Let's say you wake up in the morning and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up and you are thirsty, and so you reach for a nice rich red-containing beverage in a glass jar. Maybe it looks like cranberry juice or something of that sort. Or even a nice clear glass of water. It looks like a jug of water or a glass of water, and you drink that. Taste fine to you. Maybe even tastes great to you. And then let's say about 30 minutes later, you feel a little queasy, you feel a little off, you feel like going back to sleep, you just don't feel very good. You don't know why, but your nervous system is a predictive machine, and it has a process in which it back integrates. Or I should say integrates backwards into your immediate experience that preceded that not so good feeling. We can reliably say that there is a much lower probability that the next day when you wake up that you would reach for that same beverage or for that same container even. And maybe if you're in a novel environment, maybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel or something of that sort, you might even find that you don't really like the kitchen in which you consume that beverage in the first place. And you don't know why. And unless you got very, very sick the day before, it's unlikely that you would have such a strong response that you would entirely avoid, for instance, water or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera. Let's say you went back to the refrigerator and you consume a beverage again and you just didn't feel so well, you felt less good than you normally would. Well, even without any ability to taste what's in that beverage and even without any understanding of what was happening to you at a conscious level, there is a very, very high probability that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage and certainly at that location and in the same volume in the subsequent days. That's just the way that aversive agents work. And they work by way of activating neurons in the gut that communicate with areas in the brain that give us this feeling of queasiness. And for some of you hearing this, that pathway and that association with times in which you felt queasy and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful that you might even be feeling some of that symptomology now. For certain people that's going to be increased salivation which precedes vomiting, we know that there's a class of neurons in the brain relate to an area called area postrema that actually stimulates vomiting. And if I keep talking about this, I'll probably feel like I want to vomit, so I'm going to move on from this in a moment. So when we ingest caffeine-containing beverages and foods, it's the exact opposite scenario as to what I just described. Caffeine, as a reinforcer, makes us feel slightly better or a lot better in the immediate minutes and hours after we ingest it. So it's acting as a reinforcing agent not just while you are under the effects of caffeine but for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine, which is why you return again and again to caffeine-containing beverages, such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods that contain caffeine, even if the taste of those foods is not something that you would otherwise consider, especially delicious. In fact, most people when they take their first sip of coffee or tea or other caffeine-containing beverage, they find it to be very bitter. And that's not because of the taste of caffeine. It's because of the taste of the beverage itself independent of caffeine. However, when caffeine is present in there, they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes. In fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier, will invest a lot of financial resources and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage. What they're trying to make sure is not that they get that taste but that they get the caffeine. It is that positively reinforcing. And the taste therefore takes on new significance, new meaning, and we come to associate it as positive. And in fact, most of us, including myself, love the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee, love the taste of yerba maté even if the initial taste, the very first time that we consume that beverage, was either neutral or negative. And that is all because of the reinforcing properties of caffeine. And then, of course, there are the more direct actions of caffeine. That is, the faster actions of caffeine. And just to list those off again very briefly so that you have them in mind going forward, caffeine also increases the release of dopamine and acetylcholine, both of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain, which increases clarity of thought and your ability to rule switch, your ability to move from one context to another and change and understand the rules of engagement, social engagement, physical engagement, mental engagement, and so forth. And as I mentioned before, caffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, such that any good thing that happens to you. Any positive experience that you have will have a more potent effect on your feelings of well-being. And last but certainly not least, caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist. It reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue and your desire to sleep by parking in the receptors for adenosine and not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy, if you will, effects on your brain and body. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of Vitamin D3K2. Again, that's athleticsgreen.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of Vitamin D3K2. I'd like to just briefly talk about adenosine and some of its molecular features. And again, if you don't have a background in biology, don't worry. I promise to make this very clear to everyone. First of all, caffeine is what's called a methylxantine. It's a plant alkaloid. That's why caffeine itself is very bitter. Again, if I were to give you just the tiniest little bit of pure caffeine, you would find it to be extremely aversive. So these plants that have snuck small enough amounts of caffeine into them or that have masked the flavor of caffeine with other flavors such that bees and humans want to consume them, while we don't know what plants think, it does seem very diabolical and very clever in that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing plants, beverages, and foods even though caffeine itself is this alkaloid that is very, very bitter. Methylxantine-- that is caffeine-- binds to adenosine receptors. And there are really two types of adenosine receptors. There are these so-called A1 receptors and the A2 receptors. And they are present in different parts of the brain and body at different levels. We don't have to get too far into receptor subtypes. More importantly to understand is that adenosine makes us feel tired because of the way that it taps into the ATP pathway. The ATP pathway is central to energy production and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body in all cells and organ systems. When caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, it prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components of the energy production pathway. And the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP. So basically, when we ingest caffeine, we are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects of these cellular pathways. Now it's really important to understand that, in biology, even if you block a receptor or you prevent the activity of an enzyme and-- at least, in this case, you end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy. You're not really getting more energy. You're actually borrowing energy against an overall system that is frankly nonnegotiable. What do I mean by that? Well, let's say that you were to wake up after six or eight hours of sleep and to drink a lot of caffeine and keep drinking caffeine throughout the day blocking those adenosine receptors. Yes, you'll offset fatigue. You'll offset sleepiness because that adenosine simply can't function. But at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged from the adenosine receptors, you will have a massive glut, a backlog of adenosine, and you will feel extra, extra sleepy. So really, there's no way to create more energy in your system. Really, what you're doing is you're changing the timing in which the sleepy signals and the more energetic signals are arriving. And this is really important to understand as the backdrop to the various tools that we're going to get into next, in which you can use caffeine for enhancing mental performance and physical performance and other aspects of health. But it's very important to understand this concept that, when you wake up in the morning provided that you slept well and enough the night before, your levels of adenosine will be about as low as they will ever be. Actually, in order to get your adenosine levels really bottomed out, you want to avoid caffeine in the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking. We'll talk about why that is because it turns out there's a way to completely clear adenosine out of your system in the hour or so after waking. But for most people, adenosine levels are going to be close to their lowest after a good night's sleep. But there's really no negotiating the accumulation of adenosine that's going to occur and going to bias you towards feeling more sleepy than you would. Otherwise, that's going to occur throughout the day. There's really no way to eliminate adenosine. All you can really do is block its function. So it's sort of like borrowing energy against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel. Now this actually has a very important socioeconomical relevance. Before caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings, we were really slaves to the light/dark cycle. And this was especially true before the presence of artificial lighting. But even before the advent of artificial lighting, humans were largely constrained to the outside light/dark cycle. We need to be active during the day and working during the day, and we need to be asleep at night. Caffeine allows us to divorce ourselves from that circadian cycle. Circadian just means about 24 hour. Caffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat by way of increasing our alertness. That is, spiking our alertness at various times throughout the day and even at night. This is how we can have shift workers, for instance, that can sleep during the day and then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8:00 PM and then work into the night. That ability completely transformed our society. Now, of course, the healthiest schedule-- and we know this with certainty. The healthiest schedule for brain and body is going to be alert during the daytime and asleep at night. There's no question about that. Shift workers run into all sorts of health problems. And thank you shift workers for doing the important work that you do. We need you. Air traffic controllers, paramedics, firefighters, police officers, et cetera. But we know that there are serious health consequences, negative health consequences, that is, for shift workers. But for most people out there, about 95% of people follow a typical schedule. They're awake during the day and asleep at night. And yet it used to be before the advent of caffeine-containing beverages that, if you were sleepy in the afternoon, you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness, that your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms were governed by these circadian changes in availability of sunlight and when you slept. And you just didn't have the ability to ingest a beverage that would increase your levels of alertness because you block adenosine. So this is important to understand that, nowadays, we certainly live in a time in which we use-- in fact, 90% or more of adults and half or more of adolescents and teenagers use caffeine as a way to negotiate with, to borrow against this natural pattern of adenosine making us sleepy. But again, you're just offsetting the effects of sleepiness that adenosine causes. You can't eliminate the adenosine entirely. The important point is that adenosine as a pro-sleep molecule is a nonnegotiable aspect of your biology. In fact, it's so nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, you are going to release adenosine, and you're going to release adenosine in direct proportion to how long you've been awake. So the longer you've been awake, the more adenosine circulating in your system. There are really only a handful of ways to completely clear out adenosine. The major one being to get sleep. The other is to take a short nap, which, of course, is sleep, but it's shallow sleep. Or non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR, has been shown to reduce levels of adenosine. And there are certain things such as viewing morning sunlight, which because of its effects on cortisol, can quote unquote, "clear out adenosine." We'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes. And there's also evidence that certain forms of exercise, provided that it's brief and intense, can also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects. Now that we've talked about some of the incredible mechanisms by which caffeine changes our experience of life, increases alertness and mood, et cetera, I want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool. Now caffeine is a very potent and useful tool for enhancing mental health, physical health, and performance. But there are certain considerations one has to keep in mind, in particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody will respond to the same dose of caffeine the same way, but we can reliably say that your body weight is a good measure by which you can estimate what a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be. So for most people, ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight is going to be the range in which caffeine can have positive effects without making us feel overly anxious and give us that feeling that we're jumping out of our skin and turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine into an aversive one. For those of you that aren't familiar with thinking in terms of kilograms and normally think in pounds, I'll just quickly give you some general estimations that, for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds. So for me, I weigh 100 kilograms. That means that 1 to 3 milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth of a gram. 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight would mean for me. I could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine in a single dose, in a single drink, if that's the way I'm consuming it, or pill form if that's the way that I'm consuming it. And it's very likely that that will be a tolerable dose. However, if you are not somebody that's accustomed to drinking caffeine on a regular basis, I suggest you start on the lower end of that 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight range. So for instance, if you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms, that's approximately 110 pounds. And you would be pretty comfortable ingesting somewhere between 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine. So what I recommend is that people who are considering using caffeine as a tool or who are already ingesting caffeine, start to think about the dosage of caffeine that you are ingesting or plan to ingest and the timing in which you ingest that caffeine relative to certain tasks throughout your day, your waking, and your sleep. And we'll talk about that in just a moment. But the first step for you is to figure out how much you weigh in kilograms and then to go to that number of 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. And that's a good range in which you might want to explore the use of caffeine in a single application, meaning a single dose. Now, I do realize that some people out there are drinking coffee all day long or having coffee in the morning and again in the afternoon. What I'm referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine in a single bout, right? 1 cup of coffee or 2 cups of coffee, for instance, to achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range if that's what's appropriate for your body weight. But to avoid any confusion, when I talk about dosage of caffeine, what I'm really talking about is not the total amount of caffeine ingested per day. I'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested in one sitting or setting, that is. And if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine multiple times throughout the day, you can imagine-- for instance, let's say the appropriate dose for you in order to get an enhancement in mental performance or physical performance is 200 milligrams. And you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning, and you want to have that lift in the morning to be able to focus better. And you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon or vice versa that you would ingest 200 milligrams of caffeine at two separate times per day separated by about four hours. Now you don't have to separate them. You could put them two hours apart, for instance. But we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth. Just keep in mind that, if you're ingesting 200 milligrams of caffeine and that's the appropriate dose for you based on your body weight and then you are ingesting another 200 milligrams of caffeine an hour later, you are effectively ingesting approximately 400 milligrams of caffeine, which is going to start exceeding the dose in which you can normally tolerate without feeling anxious and jittery. With all of that said, there is a range of tolerance for caffeine that's based on two things. One is a preexisting disposition that is whether or not your genetics and nervous system and the backdrop of your life, how much stress you're experiencing tends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery before you ingest any caffeine. And the other is how so-called caffeine-adapted you are. We often hear about tolerance. Tolerance means something very specific. It's the ability to ingest more and more of something with a plateau that is a no increase or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing. But here we're not really talking about tolerance to caffeine. What we're talking about is being caffeine-adapted. A simple way to understand whether or not your caffeine-adapted or not is that, if you drink caffeine and it tends to increase your heart rate and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious, then chances are you are not caffeine-adapted, provided the amount of caffeine is within the healthy range for you, that is, the ranges we talked about a moment ago. However, here's somebody who drinks caffeine and you actually feel alert and relaxed, chances are you are caffeine-adapted. And so at various times during today's episode, I'll talk about people who are caffeine-adapted and people who are not caffeine-adapted. We'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day. I know a few habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just the simple mention of that probably sounds aversive. But there is actually great utility to using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day. But just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine and not get much of a lift from it at all. Other people will drink caffeine, and they will feel extremely anxious even at dosages far lower than that 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight range that I described a moment ago. So you have to take into account individual differences. That said, 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight for a given sitting. For your morning coffee or your morning yerba maté tea is a good range from which to start. And I do encourage you to go online and look up the various beverages and foods that you might be eating that contain caffeine. For instance, some people are surprised to discover that the coffee that they get from some of the more standard popular vendors out there, the small coffee or the medium coffee, for instance, can contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine. And the large coffee that is often sold at those commercial vendors can contain as much as 1 gram, 1,000 milligrams, of caffeine. Now you may be adapted to that such that it doesn't make you feel anxious, but if you wonder why you feel irritable and you get a headache when you don't get that caffeine or that amount of caffeine at precisely the time that you're used to getting it each day, that's because you are consuming quite large quantities of caffeine on a regular basis. So I do recommend whether or not you drink soda or coffee or tea that you figure out the source of that. OK, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from, what kind of coffee, and go online and spend a little bit of time because the information is out there to discover what levels of caffeine you're actually ingesting. Now if you happen to be ingesting more than 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine, that's not necessarily bad. However, you do want to be careful about ingesting very high levels of caffeine over long periods of time in your life because there can be issues that start to arise. In particular, a bias towards higher levels of anxiety and depletion of certain electrolytes. Because caffeine is a diuretic can cause you to lose sodium and other things of that sort. And also just from simply a dependent standpoint, it does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine that is exceeding the dosages that normally you could get away with and get just as much mental-enhancing and physical-enhancing benefits that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature. You can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks, and you can become actually quite irritable when you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine. So I do encourage you to figure out not just what an appropriate caffeine dosage would be for you but also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting. The first tool I'd like to talk about is one that I've mentioned before on this podcast several times. And it's something that if you haven't heard of will be very useful to you. And if you have heard this tool before, I'm going to add some additional features to the description of this tool that should make this worthwhile for you as well. And that is to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days. And I'll be very clear as to days in which you might want to ingest caffeine more closely to when you wake up. Why would you want to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking? The answer to that is very simple. Many people wake up in the morning. They drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes within 2 minutes of waking. And they feel more alert naturally. That makes sense because of the effects of caffeine in blocking the effects of adenosine that I talked about earlier and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems. But then what they find is that, in the early afternoon, in particular, after lunch, they experience a dramatic dip in their overall levels of energy, the so-called afternoon crash. And in most cases, the way they respond to that is to ingest more caffeine, which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness. However, as we'll soon talk about, there is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon if it falls within 8 or 10 or dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep. And that is, the caffeine ingested in the afternoon-- for most everybody, let's say for 95-plus percent of people-- disrupts the architecture and quality of their nighttime sleep. And I should say that it doesn't necessarily impact their ability to fall asleep and maybe even sleep through the night but that the depth and quality of that sleep is disrupted by consuming caffeine in the afternoon. A little bit later, I'll talk about how you can offset some of those negative effects if you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon. But there's a huge advantage to restricting your caffeine intake to the early part of your day but not consuming caffeine within the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking. In fact, many people find that if they delay their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up that they feel more alert in the morning, and they completely avoid that afternoon crash. Now that said, many people, including myself, do need a short nap or non-sleep deep rest or other form of relaxation for 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon. That is natural and healthy. I'm not referring to the need for that when I refer to the so-called afternoon crash. What I'm talking about in the afternoon crash is a inability to recover energy and focus and a need to consume more caffeine just to make it through the afternoon. By delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking, there are a couple of things that are accomplished. First of all, you offset that afternoon crash. And this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking. And the reason this works so well is the following. As I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake. It is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep. So when we emerge from sleep regardless of how long we've slept, our adenosine levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night. If you slept well enough and long enough, those adenosine levels can be very, very low, but they are never completely zero. When you wake up in the morning, even if you're one of these people that springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day-- and here I'm certainly not describing myself. I'm not one of those people. I tend to wake fairly slowly. But if you're one of those spring up and attack the day or you're one of the people who moves more slowly into your day, regardless, there's still some residual adenosine in your system. And this is particularly the case if you did not get enough sleep or enough depth of sleep the night before. The correct ratio is a slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. And for those of you interested in optimizing sleep, I'll just refer you to our master your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, the perfect your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast. And we have a tool kit for sleep all of which are available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera at hubermanlab.com. You wake up in the morning. And your adenosine levels are low, but they're not zero. And if you didn't sleep that well or deeply enough the night before, you're going to have more adenosine in your system. You might think the logical thing to do is therefore to drink caffeine and to block the adenosine that's there. But what happens if you do that is there's an accumulation, a sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around. And then in the afternoon, when the effects of that caffeine start to wear off, you will experience the so-called afternoon crash. As I mentioned earlier, there is a way to clear out the adenosine that's present when you wake up in the morning and to clear it out essentially completely without just blocking its receptors and letting it accumulate or hang around. And the way to do that is to deliberately spike your cortisol. Now, many of you have heard of cortisol, the so-called stress hormone, as a bad thing. And indeed, chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing. It depletes your immune system. It's bad for psychosocial effects. It tends to make us feel anxious and on and on. But cortisol itself is not bad. Cortisol is wonderful. Cortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system. It makes us alert and focused. It stimulates our metabolism. It does a huge number of positive things, provided that it is released in a circadian fashion. That is, at the appropriate times every 24 hours and that it tends to peak very close to waking. In fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning, assuming that you weren't woken up by some noise or sleeping in an environment that's too warm, et cetera, is that your cortisol levels start to rise. And shortly after waking, your cortisol levels will start to reach their peak. And when I refer to a cortisol pulse, that's just biology nerd speak for a rise and peak in cortisol. You want that cortisol pulse to occur early in the day close to waking, and you want that for a couple of reasons. First of all, if you don't restrict that cortisol pulse to early in the day, it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day. And actually, a late shifted cortisol peak is one of the hallmark signatures of depression, low-level depression, and serious depression. And it can start to disrupt sleep and certainly can disrupt mood metabolism and your immune system. So you want that cortisol peak early in the day. How do you ensure that that happens? Well, you wake up in the morning. And whether or not you're a bounce-out-of-bed type or you're more groggy, you kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am, you wake up, and you don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, in fact, beneficial to hydrate with water and electrolytes. Terrific. In fact, I would say necessary to get bright light in your eyes ideally from sunlight. I've talked about this many, many times before on the podcast. If you wake up before the sun comes out, then turn on bright artificial lights. But then certainly once the sun is out and even on cloudy days, in fact, especially on cloudy days, get outside for anywhere from 5 to 20, maybe even 30 minutes. Do some work outside, take your breakfast outside if you're a breakfast eater. Get something done outside even if it's just to get outside and get bright light in your eyes. Why? Well, because it's been shown in studies on humans that getting bright light in your eyes in the first hour after waking or as soon as possible after waking increases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, 5-0. And that cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases alertness, but it does one other very important thing, which is that, through an indirect pathway, it can clear out any residual adenosine that might be present in your system when you wake up in the morning. Again, this is going to be especially important for those of you that are not getting as much sleep or as much quality sleep as you would like. It's going to be very important for you to get that morning bright light ideally from sunlight, get that cortisol peak going. Other ways to increase that cortisol peak would be to do some physical activity. If you don't have time to do a full workout, well then, getting some movement-- 10 minutes of skipping rope or even 5 minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks or walking if that's all you have time for ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes. But that's going to zero out the adenosine present in your system. If, however, you were to wake up and immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol a little bit more than it would otherwise be present in your system. But by blocking those adenosine receptors and because of the indirect effects of caffeine on the cortisol system, you actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine that would otherwise occur. So I realize that's a mouthful. Just to be very clear, if you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away, you're blocking the adenosine receptor, but you're not clearing it out. You're also preventing cortisol from having its normal increase and rise such that it can directly clear out adenosine because cortisol can clear out adenosine. And that's what you want. You want to be at maximum alertness and focus in your morning and throughout your day. And by delaying your caffeine to 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you set up your system so that you get that morning cortisol peak. Ideally, a peak that's even greater because you're getting your bright light viewing. And then when you ingest your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking, not only will you be craving it just a little bit, but you will be drinking that caffeine on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness for two reasons. One is adenosine is zeroed out, and your cortisol peak is higher. And so now when you ingest caffeine, you can actually ingest levels of caffeine that are a little more reasonable that almost with certainty are going to fall in this 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage and will allow you to feel really alert and will carry that alertness well into the afternoon hours without the need to drink more caffeine and thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine and disrupting your nighttime sleep. And, of course, by getting better nighttime sleep, you're going to zero out your adenosine even more. So what I'm describing here are essentially two tools. I'm telling you to get morning sunlight and maybe some exercise in conjunction with that even if it's brief exercise. But the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking has immediate effects, but it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness the next night and the next day and so on and so forth. Now I realize there are some people who just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason. First off, let me say that, if you are somebody who likes to wake up and do very intense exercise within the first 90 minutes after waking, well, in that case, it would be appropriate to ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise. Not a problem. Not a problem. But you should expect that the combination of drinking caffeine very shortly after waking plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking will increase the intensity of that early afternoon and afternoon fatigue that you feel. Now for some people, that's a great thing. They can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep deep rest, step away from work, and so forth. In that case, I strongly encourage you to do whatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial. In fact, we did an entire episode called tool kit for fitness that describes a couple of different but really one main structure that allows you to get the appropriate amount of resistance training and cardiovascular training and flexibility training throughout the week. I happen to follow that program, and it works very well. And it does involve some of those workouts to come very early in the morning shortly after waking. And in those cases, I do ingest caffeine just prior to those, so within 10, 20 minutes of waking. However, on other days, I personally delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes, and I've done that to great benefit. And most people, if not, all people that try that, have reported the same. I should mention that some people will find getting out to that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult because they're so accustomed to ingesting caffeine close to waking up. In that case, maybe just push out your caffeine intake by about 15 minutes each day until you hit that 90 to 120-minute mark. And that will make it much easier. It might take you a week or so to get there. But once you get there, you'll find it to be quite easy to maintain. The other thing is that, if you are somebody who insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking, I would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then and then the other half of your caffeine about an hour later. That also will help offset some of the afternoon crash for reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine. Caffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours. That means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee at let's say 8:00 AM-- and let's say 100 milligram coffee just for sake of simplicity, that about 25% of that caffeine action-- we wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, but about 25% of that caffeine action will still be present at 8:00 PM that night, which is pretty remarkable. So there's a long arc of caffeine effects, and this is why it can impede sleep if we take caffeine in the afternoon. But again, if you're somebody who wakes up and you really need caffeine right away and you refuse to do this 90 to 120-minute delay thing that I'm talking about, well then, in that case, I would drink half of your caffeine upon waking and then a little bit more or the other half about an hour later. And that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects such that you don't need it again in the afternoon because you won't experience the afternoon crash. Because of the way caffeine works, I should mention that, if you ingest caffeine on an empty stomach, it will have a more potent stimulant effect. That will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness that caffeine can produce. Later, I'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness, but I'll just tell you one tool now. Many people opt to take 100 milligrams of theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, as a way to offset some of that jitteriness. Theanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine, which is why many energy drink manufacturers and even some coffee manufacturers are now putting theanine in energy drinks and in ground coffee because, no surprise, it allows people to consume more of that beverage and thereby purchase more of that beverage, which is what these vendors want without feeling overly anxious and jittery. So you can take pill form theanine if you want with your caffeine. I don't tend to do that. Rather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine. I do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach because I do restrict my caffeine intake to the early part of the day. And I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM, and then I generally my last meal some time around 8:00 PM or so. Those are averages. I would say plus or minus an hour. And that's not because I'm religiously following any kind of time-restricted feeding. It's just that tends to work best with my schedule and my appetite. But again, that's a general theme. There are days in which I wake up and I'm very hungry, and I might ingest something, small snack or something. Or if I'm meeting somebody for breakfast, sometimes I'll have breakfast. Sometimes I won't. And so on and so forth. The point is that you can get away with drinking less caffeine to get the stimulant effect if you do it on an empty stomach. And if you're somebody who likes to exercise on an empty stomach-- and I'm one of those people-- well then, ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise can be a fantastic tool. A little bit later, we'll talk about some of the physical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine. But I'll just briefly jump to a point about that as we relate to morning exercise. If you are somebody who regularly ingests caffeine-- and we can define regularly by, if you've ingested caffeine every day for the last two weeks, you're a regular consumer of caffeine. Whereas if you're somebody who only ingests caffeine somewhere between two and four times per week, well then, you are not a regular consumer of caffeine. You're an intermittent user of caffeine. Well, if you're somebody who's a regular user of caffeine, the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine are going to be most dramatic if you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine, which to my mind as a-- I don't want to call myself a caffeine addict but a regular caffeine user. That's a horrible notion to me, it is an aversive notion, because I do like the effects of caffeine so much. But if you really want to see the maximum performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you will do either one of two things. You will either abstain from caffeine for a few days or three days prior to ingesting caffeine, or you will use caffeine on an empty stomach. It's very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach enhances both the mental and physical enhancing effects of caffeine. And, of course, all of that has to be stated on the backdrop of consideration that you're very, very hungry, it can be make it hard to concentrate and so on and so forth. So I'm not encouraging people to starve themselves by any means. Certainly, don't do that. But if you want to maximize the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you will consume it on an empty stomach. And then as a final point to that, caffeine is a diuretic. It causes us to lose fluid and, along with that fluid, to excrete sodium because of the effects of caffeine on various processes within the kidney. So one thing that works very well to maintain mood and alertness longer given a certain amount of caffeine intake and to avoid the jitteriness and what can sometimes feel like a crash or low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision is to make sure that you consume at least an equal volume of water with your caffeine. And ideally, that water would contain maybe a small pinch of salt or some sort of electrolyte drink-- or powder, rather. For me, I use element. Full disclosure, they are a podcast affiliate and sponsor. But you don't need to do that. You could simply just have a glass of water alongside your coffee or espresso or your yerba maté and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that or evem just playing table salt. And that will help offset some of the jitteriness of caffeine. A lot of people think that, when they ingest caffeine, they get the jitteriness and crash because their blood sugar is low. And while that can be the case, oftentimes, it's simply because of the excretion of sodium that's occurred when they've ingested caffeine. So I encourage you to hydrate well and to hydrate with something that contains a little bit of sodium. Obviously, not so much that increases hypertension or something of that sort but a small amount of sodium or an electrolyte drink like Element. And there are other electrolyte drinks out there that can accomplish the same, of course. Just a couple of quick notes about theanine because there are a growing number of products out there that contain theanine. And there's certainly a growing number of people out there who are using theanine for the effect that I described before, which is to offset some of the jitteriness associated with caffeine-containing beverages or foods. And, of course, I should mention that I've talked about the effects of theanine on sleep at that sleep tool kit that you can find as a free download. You don't even have to sign up for. Anything you just download it from hubermanlab.com. Go to the menu, go to a newsletter. You'll see the tool kit for sleep. You'll see that the so-called sleep stack that I use and recommend includes magnesium 3 and 8, something called apigenin and theanine, although that sleep stack is designed to be taken 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep. And I make the point there, and I'll make it again here that ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams, night terrors, or night walk-- sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera. In that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.. . However, a number of people are using theanine, and products are using theanine to offset jitteriness from caffeine-containing products during the daytime, daytime consumption, that is. A couple of notes about theanine-- theanine is something that is present in green tea, right? It's now been created as a supplement. It's what's called a nonprotein amino acid. So while there are amino acids and proteins, there are, of course, amino acids and nonproteins. And theanine is one such nonprotein amino acid. Theanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate and glutamine pathway. It's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine, and it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects of the nervous system. But the general effect of theanine is to compete for the receptors for certain neurotransmitters. And the neurotransmitters I'm referring to are all excitatory neurotransmitters, things like glutamate. And they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking and action and feeling, et cetera, because they're present at so many connections between neurons in the brain. Theanine competes for the receptors for glutamate and tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness. So really, when people take theanine along with caffeine, what they're doing is they're really taking a slight-- I don't want to call it depressant to the point where it misleads people and makes people think that it will make you depressed. The word is a little bit misleading. But it tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory pro-alertness actions of neurons in the brain. So when you take it alongside caffeine, tends to, quote unquote, "even things out a bit." I should mention that the dosages of theanine that are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine is 200 to 400 milligrams, and the studies that I was able to find showed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day can be safe. But that's a very high dosage of theanine. In fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness to the point where it wouldn't feel good. There are also some positive effects of daytime consumption of theanine that are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine. For instance, there's a study demonstrating that 17 days of ingesting theanine at these 200 to 400 milligram dosage at one to three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety. There are also some good data out there showing that theanine can have positive effects on endothelial cells-- so blood vessels, capillaries, and so on-- and increase some of the function of blood vessels, allowing them to pass more blood through them and give them a little bit more elasticity, if you will. So theanine has certain pro-sleep effects if it's taken prior to sleep. It can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep. Again, if you're a sleepwalker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams from which you wake up in the middle of the night, probably best to leave out theanine or maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams. And if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely. But theanine can be terrific for enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep. It can also reduce the jitteriness associated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods. And it has certain antidepressant and pro-endothelial effects. That is, it can offset depression. It can offset anxiety, although those are minor effects, subtle effects. And it has been shown to improve endothelial cell. That is, vessel and capillary function and structure in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body. Now one final point about theanine that's worth paying attention to is that the kinetics of theanine are such that you don't need to take theanine every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage. When we ingest caffeine, the peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes after we drink it. And there, I'm assuming one takes it all at once. And this is a key point that we'll come back to later rather than sipping your coffee slowly over a couple of hours or an hour. If you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine in your coffee or 600 milligrams of your coffee if you're getting one of those commercial coffees and you take theanine along with it, theanine will block some of the jitteriness and anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine that can occur for much longer than the effects that caffeine lasts. So the peak in theanine occurs about an hour after ingestion. I suppose if you want to get really fancy and really dial in the kinetics, you could ingest theanine about half hour before you ingest your caffeine. But I think that's getting a little bit excessive in terms of controlling your microenvironment, if you will. I think it would be perfectly fine to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine along with your coffee or tea or so forth and just realize that if you drink more caffeine or you extend your caffeine intake over several hours that you don't necessarily have to take theanine repeated times throughout the day. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Let's talk for a moment about when to avoid caffeine. And in the same stroke, let's also talk about some of the myths around caffeine. For instance, one of the major myths around caffeine is that it can increase osteoporosis. It turns out that, while there is a relationship, of course, between calcium and osteoporosis-- that is reductions in bone density. And it is the case that caffeine can extract calcium from certain tissues. The large scale studies that are out there essentially prove that, if people are ingesting enough calcium through their diet, which most everybody is-- although certainly, there are some people that need to supplement calcium or make it a point to consume more calcium-containing foods. But assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium, there is no direct relationship between caffeine intake and osteoporosis, at least not that I'm aware of. I know this was debated for a number of years in the literature, but the literature seems to have arrived at a general consensus now that caffeine itself is not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis, provided people are getting enough calcium through their diet. That is, through foods, through supplementation, or both. Some of the other myths around caffeine are that, for instance, caffeine will reduce testosterone levels or will reduce estrogen levels. Other myths out there are in exact opposite to that, that caffeine will increase testosterone levels, in particular, free testosterone levels. There have been some large scale studies addressing the hormone effects of caffeine. They are a little bit difficult to do. I should just mention that caveat. And the reason they are difficult to do is because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine. And therefore, you can imagine it's very hard to find a control group to compare the caffeine consumers to. In particular, a control group that's well controlled for other things like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera. However, when one controls as well as one can for all the various factors that could impact hormones, what one discovers is that caffeine intake, at least at the dosages we talked about earlier, 1 two 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight or even up to double that, that there are no consistent increases or reductions in testosterone or estrogen in men or women that can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake. And I say directly attributed because in these association studies, one always has to wonder, for instance, if because people are ingesting more caffeine, they have more energy and therefore exercising more. And exercise is known to have effects on testosterone, estrogen, and other hormones, whether or not the effects of caffeine on those hormones is indirect and so on and so forth. And this all just underscores the challenges of doing studies on humans in the wild in their natural habitat of living as opposed to an acute study as it's called to bring someone into the laboratory and studying them just for those hours or moments. With all that said, there does appear to be a relationship between caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone binding globulin, which is a protein present in the body of both men and women that binds to the sex steroid hormones-- testosterone and estrogen-- and prevents them from being in their free or active form. It has been shown that ingestion of caffeine-- even in the sorts of dosage ranges that are considered safe and that we've been discussing-- can increase sex hormone binding globulin such that it can slightly reduce overall levels of free testosterone and free estradiol in women. Now those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist. If any of you are interested in reading further into the effects of caffeine on hormones, I'll just refer you to a couple of studies. We will link to this in the show note caption. The title of the study is "Consumption of caffeinated beverages and serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men." And within this study, there is a reference to a equally sized empowered study done on women, both of which converged on the same conclusion, by examining more than a thousand. So in this case, 1,410 men or more than a thousand women, that there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin associated with increased intake of coffee, in particular. But they were able to narrow that down specifically to ingestion of caffeine. So it's not coffee per se that's causing the increase in sex hormone binding globulin. It's actually caffeine itself. So again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin were not so significant that, at least to my mind, they seem like a concern, although I think that it is worth noting that if you're going to consume caffeine that you probably want to consume caffeine in a way that is in dosages and with the sort of timing that will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine but not to excess, so to derive the benefits of caffeine without for instance driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far. Now why would that be a good idea? Why would you want to make sure that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen? Well, some of that is related to the acute effects of those hormones in terms of well-being and libido and strength and mood, et cetera, but some of those also relates to the longer term effects of sex steroid hormones. Many people don't realize this, but the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors at the surface of cells to have immediate effects. But they also can enter cells and actually go into the nucleus of cells where the DNA of those cells are contained and control gene expression in those cells. So the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen, are controlling a lot of different cellular functions over long periods of time. So blunting their action over long periods of time is probably not a great idea. But again, at the dosages of caffeine that we're talking about today, 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, unlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin that one experiences from that are going to be detrimental. And certainly, the positive effects of caffeine that one experiences in terms of mental performance and physical performance and the fact that it increases energy to do the sorts of things like exercise that we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles, twofold or threefold improvement in hormone profiles. In that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine is overall a good thing, provided it's not in excess. That also makes this the appropriate time to mention one of the more impressive effects of caffeine, which is on overall levels of mood and mental health. There are several studies on this, but the one that I'm particularly fond of was published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research. And the title of the paper is "Inverse association between caffeine intake and depressive symptoms in US adults." And these are data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. And the basic takeaway is that, while, of course, there are a ton of different factors that are going to relate to whether or not people are depressed or not, life circumstances, genetics, and so on, that-- and here I'm quoting from the study. "Caffeine's psychostimulant properties-- that just means the ability to make us feel more alert and positive-- appeared to protect against depressive symptoms." And, of course, they acknowledge that additional studies are needed, but this is just one of several studies pointing to the fact that people who regularly ingest caffeine in the appropriate dosages do seem to enjoy an antidepressive effect overall. I wouldn't want anyone to consider caffeine a treatment for severe depression or at least not alone a treatment for severe depression. But provided the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine can be kept in check through use of theanine or making sure that the dosage and the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct, then caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood and prevent depression or at least keep depression at bay when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe. And, of course, there are the don'ts surrounding caffeine intake as it relates to sleep. And to put it very simply, sleep-- that is getting enough quality sleep each night-- is the foundation. It is the bedrock of mental health, physical health, and performance. Sleep and the power of sleep far exceeds any nootropic you could ever take, any prescription drug you could ever take, any health-promoting tool for your immune system, your metabolism, your mental function, your physical function you could ever take. Sleep is the bedrock. I know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep. Nobody is perfect about sleep. That's important to keep in mind. I think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep of sufficient duration 80% of the nights of your life and then as much as possible to make sure that the remaining 20% of nights you are not getting enough sleep for good reasons as opposed to hard reasons. Good reasons would include raising children. That's important. After all, every species desires to make more of itself and to preserve and extend the well-being of its young, so child-rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason to get a lack of sleep. But you really want to strive to get quality sleep most nights of your life, which means that, even if you're somebody who can, quote unquote, "drink an espresso" and then fall right asleep, that you avoid caffeine intake in the 12 hours prior to sleep. I realize not everyone will be able to do that. And in fact, I sometimes violate that, so I tend to go to sleep around 10:00 PM every night, sometimes 11:00, occasionally 12:00 midnight, but usually around 10:00 PM every night. I confess that my last ingestion of caffeine is not always 10:00 AM or prior to that, so sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11:00 AM or maybe noon. And very, very rarely, I'll have an afternoon coffee or espresso or noncalorie-containing soda or tea or something that's of that sort. But I really tried to restrict my caffeine intake to the early part of my day that is before noon, given that I go to sleep around 10:00 PM each night. And I strongly encourage everyone out there to try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake. This is something that Dr. Matt Walker, who's an expert sleep researcher out of University of California Berkeley Psychology and neuroscience department there, author of the incredible book Why We sleep. He's been on this podcast, many other podcasts, talking about the importance of sleep. He will remind us, and I'll remind you now that the quarter life of caffeine is 12 hours. I mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to repeat it again. And that means that, if you ingest caffeine at noon, 25% of its effects more or less, OK? I'm using a broad stroke here to talk about quarter life. 25% of that is still going to be bioactive at midnight that night, which will disrupt the early phase of your night, the amount of slow-wave sleep, which then in turn will disrupt the amount of rapid eye movement sleep, which will disrupt your emotional processing during the following day and so on and so forth. None of this is to say that if you have the occasional cup of coffee in the afternoon, that it's going to completely demolish your sleep/wake cycle forever. But I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine in the 12 hours prior to sleep. And if you can't do that, within the 10 hours prior to sleep. And if you can't do that, within the 8 hours prior to sleep. So really try and limit your caffeine intake in the 8 to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night. And, of course, slow-wave sleep, aka deep sleep, is the sleep that's associated with somewhat mundane dreams, which makes it sound like it might not be that important. But it's also the sleep that's associated with growth hormone release, which is important for protein synthesis, repair of all bodily tissues and metabolism. And slow-wave sleep is also critically attached to your immune system's ability to clear out bacteria and viruses that might otherwise infect your tissues. Now I'd like to talk about caffeine and performance. And that includes both mental performance and physical performance. Now I'd like to talk about caffeine and its positive effects on performance when used correctly. And here we are referring to both mental performance and physical performance. The exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool has been explored since the 1930s, at least that's some of the earliest documented literature on this. Although I have to imagine, given that people have been using caffeine for much longer than that, that long ago somebody realized that, by ingesting a certain plant, that they felt much more alertness and were able to hunt and gather or do any number of different things better and, as a consequence, decide to consume more of that plant. Now these days, we consume a lot of caffeine in the form of coffee and tea mainly, and some people consume it in the form of caffeine tablets or energy drinks, et cetera. Across the board, one finds that caffeine intake at a level of 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight improves reaction time. That is, it reduces the amount of time to take a physical action or to answer a question correctly with a verbal response. It can also improve coordination. It can also improve memory, although I do want to mention that, whereas most studies of the effects of caffeine on improving mental and physical performance involve taking caffeine at 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight before the mental task or physical task, there is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine on memory if one takes caffeine after learning certain material or I should say being exposed to certain material. We'll come back to that in a few minutes. If one examines reaction time, mood, alertness, focus, and memory or the ability to call up information from memory, or physical dexterity, power output, endurance, and overall feelings of well-being during exercise and exertion, caffeine has been shown in numerous studies in both men and women to improve all of those metrics significantly. So this is all just to say that caffeine is an incredible performance-enhancing tool. Now, what's not obvious from the statement that caffeine is a performance-enhancing tool across the board and in men and women and in different contexts is that the way in which caffeine is taken is very important. Because 90% or more of adults consume caffeine, finding controls for studies of caffeine is really challenging. That is, finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly is a very challenging task for the researcher. And as a consequence, many of the studies of caffeine on human beings involve depriving regular caffeine users of caffeine and then examining the effects of caffeine given after a period of, say, 5 to 15 days of abstinence in a person that is essentially experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms because they haven't had the caffeine that they were used to getting. So this is an important point. And it's a point that likely exacerbates the observed pro-performance effects of caffeine. Now all of that isn't necessarily a problem, provided you keep it in mind. And it actually points to a way in which even if you're a regular caffeine user, you can extract more of the benefits of caffeine. The simplest way to do this, for instance, is to look back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your cortisol increase restricted to the hour or hours just after waking in terms of mood and alertness and performance. One of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol early in the day is to consume caffeine shortly after that peak occurs. And this was really nicely demonstrated in a study entitled caffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels. We will provide a link to this study. It's a somewhat complicated study because they looked at a bunch of different times of day for caffeine intake. And I should mention, in this study, they use this 300 milligrams per day or 600 milligrams per day. So that's quite high, although for people of sufficient body weight and who are accustomed to taking caffeine, it's certainly not going to be in excess of what a lot of people out there are taking. But basically, what they observed was the following. Cortisol responses to caffeine are reduced but not eliminated in people who consume caffeine on a daily basis. What this means is that, if you wake up-- as I recommended earlier, you avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking, but you do get some sunlight or other bright light in your eyes in that time, maybe even get some exercise in that time, which would be even better-- and then you ingest caffeine, you will get a further increase in cortisol, which, provided it's restricted to the early part of the day, is a good thing overall for mood and alertness. So this is a simple performance-enhancing tool, which is to stack caffeine on the tail of that early cortisol peak. I should also mention, however, that, in this study, they had people do a five-day caffeine abstinence prior to being tested with 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams of caffeine. So the simple tool to extract from this and other studies like it is that, if you want to experience the maximum alertness-promoting effects of caffeine when you ingest it early in the day, you would abstain from caffeine for five days and then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking. I would still hope that you were doing all the other things that I described-- morning sunlight, exercise, et cetera-- correctly. But regardless, it's very clear that a five-day abstinence from caffeine however painful that might be will increase the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine when you take caffeine on that sixth day. Now, I'm sure many of you out there are saying, why would I ever want to abstain from caffeine for five days in order to just get this six-day performance-enhancing effect? Well, there are a couple of reasons for doing that. Perhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone, and you want to use caffeine as a stimulant to stay up during the day in the new time zone. That's a somewhat unusual case. Others of you might be interested in the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine. We'll talk more about these in a little bit. But you want to get the maximum strength increase or the maximum endurance increase from ingesting, in this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine. Well, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days will greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects of caffeine when you take it on that sixth day, although admittedly, those five days are likely to be pretty painful if you're a regular caffeine user. Another variation on this, however, might be to have the amount of caffeine that you ingest on a daily basis and then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake on that day in which you need the caffeine to really boost your mood, energy, and performance. Another reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine or reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time and then go back to your regular caffeine intake is simply to identify how much of an effect caffeine is really having on your overall level of daily functioning and mood. This was something that was actually covered in beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan all about caffeine. It's available on Audible. I really enjoyed that book. It describes his experience with the decision to completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months, although I confess that after hearing that book, what it basically made me want to do is never quit drinking caffeine because it sounded as if, at least my interpretation was, that even after several weeks or months of abstaining from caffeine, that he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine. But he did mention that, when returning to ingesting caffeine after a period of long abstinence, that it had almost a-- let's not call it a psychedelic property, but it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness and feelings of well-being that it really highlighted for him the extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him to just function what he thought was normally. So in other words, many of us don't even really know what our normal basal level of cognitive and physical functioning is because we're ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis. I confess that, as much as I enjoyed that book and as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence and then the return to caffeine was, I don't intend to ever find out personally. Now a very good reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine for a deliberate period of time and then return to caffeine intake is for its physical performance-enhancing effects. And here we can look to a really interesting study. The title of which is "Time course of tolerance to the performance effects of caffeine." And what I like about this study is that, while yes, it does say that abstaining from caffeine and then returning to caffeine intake can enhance physical performance in a very specific way, it also says that, if you take caffeine regularly, you can still see the physical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine. Although they are not quite as robust as they would be had you abstained from caffeine. The design of the study is pretty straightforward. They had people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days. Many people are already doing that, I realize, but they had people do that or ensure that they were doing that. Or others ingested a placebo for 20 days, so they abstained from caffeine without realizing it. Then after that 20 days of either ingesting caffeine or a placebo, their peak performance was measured in terms of aerobic output. But prior to that measurement, they had caffeine, OK? So it's 20 days of caffeine and then a 21st day of caffeine and then the physical task on that 21st day. Or it's 20 days of abstinence from caffeine. And then on day 21, you get caffeine, and you get the same physical test. And what they discovered was that the ingestion of caffeine increased peak performance in this aerobic output dramatically if people had abstained from caffeine. But for people that had consumed caffeine all the way through up until that day, it still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21 but not as effective as it would have been had they abstained. And in fact, the magnitude of what they call ergogenic effect, which is the pro-performance-enhancing effect of caffeine, was higher on the first day than in subsequent days when they allowed people to continue caffeine intake. So the takeaway from this study is really straightforward. If you want to get the maximum physical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you abstain from caffeine for 20 days. Then on day 21, when you're going to do the physical thing, the task, you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes to an hour before you do that physical challenge. Now 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough for a lot of people. I certainly don't want to sign up for this study. In which case, you might want to do five days of abstinence as we talked about before. And then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine and do the physical task. There are even some studies showing that you can abstain from caffeine for just two days, for just 48 hours. And, in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine, this allows you to, on day three, ingest caffeine at the dose that's appropriate for you and do the physical, or I should mention mental performance task and perform significantly better than those that have been taking caffeine throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge. So you don't necessarily need to abstain for 20 days in order to get the pro-performance effects of caffeine on day 21. You could do five days of abstinence prior or even two days of abstinence prior. Or if that's intolerable to you as it is in my mind, to me, to just reduce your caffeine intake slightly or even perhaps have it if you can tolerate that in the week or two weeks or maybe even three weeks preceding some physical or mental challenge. Now again, this sort of implies that you're going up against a marathon, or you're going up against a series of long tests, maybe standardized tests in one day. There, I just really want to point out that there is an abundant literature showing that people perform best on mental tests if they are in the state that they were when they studied for that material. Now in college, I knew a number of people who took this to the extreme, thinking that if they were to study under the effects of alcohol, that they would be best off consuming alcohol prior to taking exams. And it turns out to not be the case. Here we're talking, in particular, about psychostimulant effects of caffeine and other compounds. So don't think that you can drink or be under the influence of THC and then take-- when you study and then take an exam under the same influence and do just as well as you would had you not ingested anything. Please don't let that be the takeaway. However, do let it be the takeaway that caffeine's effects are made more potent by a brief to not so brief period of abstinence prior to taking a dosage of caffeine. And then the final point to make is that, if you are somebody who is not accustomed to drinking caffeine, meaning you're hypersensitive to caffeine or you don't regularly ingest caffeine, please do not ingest caffeine on the day of any important mental or physical challenge or performance, because what you will find is that because you are not caffeine-adapted, you will experience changes in your thermal regulation, in your levels of anxiety and jitteriness, and your levels of focus that could be very detrimental to mental or physical performance. So you don't want to throw yourself in the deep end by ingesting caffeine if you're not used to it. And I should mention that for people that are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine or are very sensitive to caffeine. Even 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine in the amount that's found in, for instance, a piece of certain types of chocolate can actually cause anxiety. So be careful there. Here, I'm referring only to people that are accustomed with caffeine intake. So what I recommend is to explore the ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training and then to make a decision about what you can reasonably and reliably do in terms of abstinence and then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge. I get a lot of questions as to whether or not caffeine has different effects on the nervous system and on performance in particular, depending on phases of the menstrual cycle. So I explored that in my research for this episode, and I found two studies both of which we will reference in the show note captions. The first one is entitled "Caffeine consumption and menstrual function." So it's actually the relationship between caffeine and menstrual function. We will do an entire episode about the menstrual cycle and menstrual function. But the other one as it relates to performance was published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition, which is "Ergogenic effects of caffeine on peak aerobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle." And the basic takeaway of this study is-- frankly, a very nice study, showed that quote, "Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power in the early follicular, preovulatory, and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle." Thus, the ingestion-- and again, here they use 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body mass might be considered an ergogenic aid for women who are in the menstrual cycle during all three phases of their cycle. So keep that in mind, women-- for those of you that are regular users of caffeine or you're using caffeine to enhance physical performance, there does not seem to be any menstrual cycle phase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance. That is, caffeine seems to always increase physical performance regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle you might happen to be in. I'd like to touch on a little bit more of the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance. Yes, it is the case that ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight in the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task or sitting down to doing some studying or learning of any kind, physical or mental performance, of any kind is beneficial for all the reasons we talked about before, relate to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera. But it turns out that it is also the case that spiking one's adrenaline and other so-called catecholamines-- so this would be dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine-- after a bout of learning can greatly enhance memory for the information that one was trying to learn. That's right. Spiking your adrenaline after learning can greatly increase memory for the material you're trying to learn. In fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries and was written about in a beautiful Annual Review of Neuroscience on the biology of memory by James McGaugh, where he talks about medieval practices of children being taught information and then being thrown literally into cold water to stimulate the release of adrenaline and that increase in adrenaline. While the mechanism wasn't completely understood, it was understood that that sort of shock to the system from the cold water led to better memory and retention of the information that these children had been exposed to. And it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults in the laboratory or kids in the laboratory. And here I'm not suggesting throwing anyone into cold water. If you want to get into cold water, there's a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure on the podcast is that it should be deliberate and controlled by you, not by somebody else. And if it's controlled by somebody else, that might be military screening or something. But here we're talking about deliberately increasing your levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera. You can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck in cold water of any kind. But the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline by ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine after sitting down to try and learn some material I confess that, more often than not, I use caffeine in the same way that most people use it, which is OK. I'm going to sit down. I'm going to research information for a podcast or assemble some information for a paper or grant, and I want to focus. So I will drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of that and maybe even throughout that or a couple of yerba maté at the beginning or throughout that. Or I'll sip on one or both throughout trying to learn. And that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus and alertness and retention of information, but it is indeed the case. That is, the research supports the fact. And I've experienced the fact that, if I abstain from caffeine while I'm trying to learn something-- but then I drink caffeine immediately after. Somewhat surprisingly to me but certainly in a way that's consistent with the research literature, memory for the information that I was focused on prior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater. And here I'm talking about as a personal anecdote, but this is actually what the data point to both in animals and in humans. And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense because the way that the memory systems of the brain are organized is that we go through life experiencing things. We encounter surprises both good and bad. We go through the motions of things both typical, mundane, exciting, and novel, and not novel. And then every once in a while, something will happen that will spike our catecholamines. Dopamine, typically if it's a positive surprise. Adrenaline, which can be associated with both positive surprise or positive events and negative events or surprises. And without fail, increases in the catecholamines tend to lock in memories for things that preceded the increase in those catecholamines. Again, the catecholamines being dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, sometimes all three in combination, sometimes just two of those, sometimes just one of those, depending on the experience. So it makes perfect sense that using caffeine at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory for the information that we are trying to learn. So if you decide that you want to try and extract this performance-enhancing effect of caffeine, what I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine for a day or two prior. But if you can't, you just continue with your normal caffeine intake. But then when you sit down to study or learn something to not ingest any caffeine as you do that but then afterward to ingest caffeine. Now in theory, you could probably further enhance the memory encoding effects of adrenaline and the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine and then taking a cold shower or doing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to or had the ability to or doing some sort of intense form of exercise. And we'll talk in a moment about how caffeine, exercise, and the adrenaline system interact. But as a brief but relevant to side, brief bouts of intense exercise ranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so have been shown to improve memory for information that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise. This is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU as well as other laboratories, some of the work that's being done at Stanford in the Mind, Body Laboratories. And our laboratory points in the direction of these kinds of effects as well. They all come back to the same general neurochemical theme, which is that, when we experience an increase in these catecholamines that include adrenaline, dopamine, and norepinephrine, the memory systems of the brain flip on in a way that try to capture the information and the perceptions and the experiences that we were exposed to just prior to the increase in catecholamines and caffeine but also exercise and also cold water. And, of course, any of those alone or in combination all increase the levels of catecholamines, so it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense as to why this would work. And in fact, it does work. If you want to remember specific information, you might consider using caffeine as you move through and absorb and are exposed to that information. But you might also consider using caffeine after being exposed to that information because studies in animals and humans show that that is a potent way to increase memory for what you are just exposed to. I should mention that what I just described also pushes back on something that I know a number of people perhaps have heard about and maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino. I remember hearing about this a few years back. It was sort of trend, if you will. The trend involved drinking a cup of coffee or a double espresso and then going down for a nap typically in the afternoon and then waking up. And the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system right at the time that you awake from the nap and that you would be better able to focus and exercise. There are a couple of things about that practice that I don't like. First of all, it implies, in most cases, that you're napping and ingesting caffeine in the afternoon, which I realize for many students and for people that are comfortable staying up until the wee hours of the night and then waking up late the next day might be compatible with their schedule. But again, because of the sleep-diminishing effects of caffeine-- and we talked about earlier. I'm not crazy about the idea of people ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon in order to perform better in the late afternoon. Far better would be to restrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day as we talked about earlier. The other reason is that the data on things like non-sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon-- and again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap. But if you want to nap, it's been shown that naps of 90 minutes or less or non-sleep deep rest protocols-- and you can find those-- for instance, there's one with me speaking. You just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube. You can hear that. It's completely zero cost. There are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course, if you prefer those, that those can all lead to increases in one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine. That's been shown in a really nice neurotransmitter labeling study, not from my laboratory, but from another laboratory, but also can improve mood, focus, and alertness on its own without the need to ingest caffeine prior to going into those states. And in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap or ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and NSDR in restoring natural levels of alertness and focus that would lead to the performance-enhancing effect. So I'm not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino, although if any of you out there have derived great benefit from it, definitely let me know your protocol and what you've experienced. Put it in the comment section if you would. I'd appreciate that. There's another very important and potent use of caffeine for enhancing performance. And this relates not just to the dopamine and epinephrine and the arousal-inducing effects of caffeine. And it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine on enhancing frontal lobe function. It does include all that, but it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine that we talked about at the beginning of the episode. And the best way to illustrate these performance-enhancing effects of caffeine that stem directly from its association with reinforcement is to highlight a study. And the title of the study is "Blood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running." And as the title suggests, this was carried out in men, but there's no reason to think that the same results wouldn't also be present in women. There are some sex-dependent effects of caffeine. I'll touch on just briefly at the end. But those are largely present in kids. That is, adolescents and teens as opposed to adults. So this study is really interesting. What they had people do was run on a treadmill and either ingest caffeine-- again, 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight-- or to not ingest caffeine. And then they looked at levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters and hormones, such as prolactin and cortisol. And the basic takeaway is, as the title suggests, that exercise, while on its own, can increase cortisol in healthy ways, provided it's not too intense and too long. A little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high-intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes. Or 90 minutes probably being the outer threshold. I realized that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise. But most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis. And limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less-- that doesn't include the warm-up-- is going to be beneficial. See the episode on tool kit for fitness if you'd like details on that. Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol, and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently and things like testosterone and estrogen in ways that we know are beneficial to us and, of course, have all these positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects. But unbeknownst to most people, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release associated with exercise specifically. And this has two important effects. First of all, that increase in dopamine is great because it provides a long-lasting increase in focus alertness and motivation, not just during the exercise, but also after the exercise. And second, it-- that is, caffeine and dopamine in combination-- act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise and the period immediate after exercise more pleasant and, in fact, reinforcing. So in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine that's beneficial for mood and alertness is to ingest caffeine prior to exercise. Now this is important because a number of people out there are exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love doing all the things that are beneficial for their health, but a number of people out there really don't like to exercise. And that serves as a serious block for their willingness and their consistency to exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise. It increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones that are good for us during exercise. But as I'm highlighting here, it also increases the reinforcement pathways associated with exercise. That is, it creates a positive feeling about the general theme of engaging in exercise, and it creates a general positive experience of the things that follow exercise. So I think this, if nothing else is a call for or support for the idea, that ingesting caffeine as a performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. But for those out there that don't enjoy exercise, in particular, certain forms of exercise, ingesting caffeine can change your relationship to that exercise. In other words, make it more positive, much in the same way that ingesting caffeine alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral or maybe even negative can actually make the taste of that particular drink or food positive. So again, this brings us back to the reinforcing properties of caffeine that are subconscious. It's not just about the enhanced performance in the test or the enhanced performance on the treadmill or with the weights in the gym. It's enhanced feelings of mood and well-being that are genuine because of the effect of caffeine on certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems, but it also is creating an overall milieu of reinforcing all of the things that led in to occur during and occur after exercise. I do want to point out something that's very important as it relates to combining things like caffeine and exercise in order to increase dopamine. This is something that came up in the episode that I did on dopamine, motivation, and drive, which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes. Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com and links to all formats with time stamps, et cetera. This also came up in the episode on ADHD because of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine. And that's this notion of dopamine stacking. In the episode on dopamine, motivation, and drive, I pointed out that, while there are a near-infinite number of things that can increase dopamine release, most notably positive surprise or positive anticipation or experiencing a win. Certainly, there are compounds, both drugs of abuse, food, sex, and certain supplements that can increase dopamine to varying levels and to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy. That's all contained in that episode on dopamine, motivation, and drive. But what I pointed out is that, if you are somebody who tends to experience difficulty with motivation-- that so-called dopamine stacking as I called it might be something that you want to avoid. What's dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking would be combining a highly caffeinated energy drink that also includes the amino acid tyrosine, which is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music plus getting yourself really ramped up then an intense workout. All of that can be great if you do it every once in a while. But what you will quickly find is that the extent to which your dopamine peaks also dictates the extent to which your dopamine will drop after that peak. And when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline. So a lot of people find that, if they stack a lot of things to peak their dopamine, then they experience a low, and it does take some time for them to return to baseline. And I highly recommend not engaging in activities or consuming compounds that are in attempt to accelerate that return to baseline because all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower. So this requires being able to tolerate a drop in dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera. Now the reason I'm bringing this up now in the context of this caffeine episode is I just described a study in which using caffeine prior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise. And so you might be saying, especially if you heard that earlier episode, wait, isn't that dopamine stacking? Aren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine? Well, in some sense, yes. But keep in mind, I'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise. So just as in that earlier episode, I emphasized the fact that, while stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera-- for exercise or for mental work or for any experience for that matter is OK to do every once in a while for most people, you don't want to get in the habit of doing it consistently every time you exercise or every time you go out, for instance. And so you really want to be cautious. That is, you want to protect your both baseline levels of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine. That said, for people that want to experience an increase in mood, alertness, and performance, or who want to condition themselves-- because that's really what it is. It's conditioning yourself by the reinforcing effects of dopamine to increase your liking or maybe even your loving of exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine or frequently using caffeine prior to exercise is fine but be very careful. And by being very careful, what I mean is pay attention to how you feel in the hours and days after that dopamine increase wears off. So for instance, if you ingest caffeine and then exercise very intensely and you're feeling great afterwards but then eight hours later or the next day, you're feeling a little bit low, I suggest you don't go back and do the exact same thing right away. I would give yourself a little bit of time to let that baseline of dopamine return to normal. So again, stacking different things, chemical and behavioral, in order to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way that's beneficial to you, depending on your goals. But be careful about not stacking too many stimuli for dopamine too often. That's the key. Early in the episode, I mentioned one possible caffeine-consuming schedule that works very well that doesn't fortunately subject you to long 20-day bouts or 5-day or even 2-day bouts of abstinence. And that's the every other day schedule of caffeine. If you look at the half-life of caffeine and you look at its effects on the dopamine system and its performance-enhancing effects and how a period of abstinence can, in fact, increase the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine-- but also take into consideration that caffeine can be habit-forming, and we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine. Well then, what emerges from all of that is that being a person who consumes caffeine every other day can actually help you maximize most of the positive effects of caffeine without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs if you're accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day and then suddenly go into a 2 or 5 or 20-day abstinence. So I myself have never tried an every other day caffeine approach, although I'm considering doing it based on the literature that I've read. And I'm considering doing it in a very specific way, which would be to only consume caffeine on the days in which I resistance train. And since I tend to do that about three or four days per week organized in a way that's every other day-- again, if you want to see the exercise schedule that I follow, including cardiovascular exercise and weight training and all the reasons and rationale for what I do and how it maps on to the scientific literature, relate to health span and lifespan, vitality, et cetera, you can find that at hubermanlab.com. And we had a tool kit for fitness that ought to be posted to our website before long. The every-other-day schedule of caffeine intake, to me, seems like the most rational one if one wants to maximize on the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine without suffering the effects of caffeine withdrawal that are associated with being a regular consumer of caffeine and then stopping caffeine intake, such as headache and irritability and so forth. Not I nor anyone in my life wants me to experience those effects, and I'm sure you don't want to experience those effects for you either. So if you're somebody that decides to try the every other day protocol or you are somebody who's already doing that protocol, please let me know what your experiences with that are. At least by my read of the literature on caffeine and it's performance-enhancing effects but also the effects of caffeine on neurotransmitter and hormone systems, the every-other-day caffeine schedule does seem to be the most rational and scientifically grounded one in order to maximize on all those effects. In addition to so-called performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, there are also the well studied and now fairly well mechanistically understood pro-health effects of caffeine. Now, here when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine, I want to be very clear that, if your schedule of caffeine intake-- that is, your timing of caffeine intake or anything else for that matter-- offsets getting regular high quality sleep of sufficient duration, well, then you are undermining the pro-health effects of that thing. This is true for exercise. This is true for caffeine. This is true for supplementation. This is true for prescription drugs. Again, you don't want to be neurotically attached to the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night because that's simply not true but is absolutely the case that anything, whether or not it's good for you or bad for you in the short term, that disrupts your sleep because of the timing in which you're doing that thing is going to undermine your immediate and long-term health before long. So with that said, there are several well described health-promoting effects of caffeine ingestion. And once again, when I say caffeine ingestion, I'm referring to that 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight dosage. There are really nice studies showing that being a regular consumer of caffeine can help offset some of the probability, some of the probability of developing Parkinson's and maybe Alzheimer's-related dementia as well. These are not terribly controversial data because of the fact that caffeine is known to increase the release of those catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, as well as acetylcholine. All those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems are the ones that are known to be defective in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, although there are other transmitter and hormone systems that are defective as well. There are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases. They're quite extensive. And I'll just refer you to one and the references therein, and we'll provide a link to this in the show note caption. So the title as the topic at hand suggests is the neuroprotective effects of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases. This was published in 2016. I'm sure there have been other reviews since then, but it includes many, many quality references and studies, both in animals and in humans, pointing to the fact that specific enzymes that are associated with the health of, in particular, dopamine neurons are made more robust by regular ingestion of caffeine. It also points to the fact that the increase in dopamine receptors that is induced by regular ingestion of caffeine that I referred to earlier is another way in which dopamine, however many dopamine neurons remain around in people with Parkinson's or people who are aging that lose dopamine neurons naturally, that dopamine can have its maximal effect because of the increase in receptors for dopamine that caffeine induces. And there are other biological mechanisms that further support why caffeine ought to be neuroprotective, including its effects on the acetylcholine system, which is one of the major systems disrupted in Alzheimer's dementia. So in other words, it makes perfect sense as to why caffeine would be neuroprotective. Caffeine has also been shown to diminish headache, particularly when taken in combination with aspirin. And that's because of the effects of caffeine and aspirin on blood flow. There's also evidence that caffeine can provide brief but substantial relief from asthma. So I wouldn't want people to rely on caffeine as a lifesaving approach to an asthmatic attack. That said, for people that suffer from minor asthma, that caffeine intake-- again, of the dosages that we talked about before has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms of asthma for anywhere from one to four hours. And I know this is of relevance to a lot of people out there. Because caffeine increases the catecholamines and in particular because caffeine increases dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex-- this area of the brain that's associated with focus and rule setting and context and task switching-- caffeine is known to improve focus and alertness, in particular, in people who have symptoms of ADHD or other attention and focus issues. Now caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent for the treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin, Adderall, modafinil, or modafinil and Vyvanse. If you would like a sort of head by head comparison of prescription drugs, supplements, and things like caffeine as well as coverage of behavioral tools and nutritional tools, et cetera that can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD, please see the episode that I did on ADHD. Again, that's available at hubermanlab.com in all formats. But that said, caffeine does increase focus, and it does it through a number of different mechanisms, not the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission in the forebrain just as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall would, although not to the same extent as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does. Before we close today, I do want to just briefly return to the reinforcing effects of caffeine that we talked about earlier. This study on the honeybees that showed that bees prefer certain vectors because they contain caffeine. Even though they are not aware that those vectors contain caffeine, they just come to like the feeling that those nectars provide them so much that they associate that in a subconscious way with the flowers themselves, and they come to like those flowers. Or human beings. For instance, children that ingest caffeinated beverages come to adore the taste of those beverages. And beautiful studies have been done that describe how children and adults truly cannot distinguish between the taste of a caffeinated and noncaffeinated beverage. And caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food. In fact, the studies have been done with yogurt. If you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors-- even plain yogurt which most kids don't like-- they will come to prefer whatever flavor contain the caffeine even if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor. Now eventually, their preference for that flavor will be extinguished, but all of this is just to say that so many of the things that we like, whether or not it's coffee or tea or a given flavor of food or a given experience or even exercise, occur because we ingest caffeine in conjunction with those activities. Now these are not tricks that your nervous system plays on you. These are real neurochemical-reinforcing effects. And I think that we would all do well to think about and to leverage these reinforcing effects much in the same way we would do well to think about and hopefully not leverage aversive effects of certain compounds, right? The simple way to put this is I or anyone could get you to dislike something, someone, or some place by making you feel slightly less good, lower mood. I don't even have to make you feel nauseous but less good after ingesting something or having a certain kind of interaction or being in a certain environment, very straightforward to do that, because of the way that your nervous system is wired for conditioning. However, there's the positive side of all this, which is that it's very straightforward to reinforce the experience of a given food, including its taste, but all the context around it, the container, the texture, the people you consume it with, where you consume it, et cetera. For instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine with broccoli. And here I'm not suggesting that people actually do that experiment or play that trick on people, but you have to sort of imagine that, if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer of all sorts of things, in particular, things that we ingest and would want to ingest more of if it's paired with caffeine, well then, you actually can use caffeine as a tool to increase reinforcement of different things. And you can avoid caffeine as a way to further reinforce things that you would like to stop. And here I'd like to just give the example of sugar cravings. A lot of people ask me, how do I avoid sugar cravings? I've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that. I've talked about making sure you're getting enough essential fatty acids and essential amino acids as a way to reduce sugar cravings. Please note, however, that if you are somebody who likes to have your sugar, whether or not it's a piece of chocolate or your dessert, et cetera-- I'm not saying that's bad, but if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings, ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine? Could be the caffeine contained in that sugar-containing food like chocolate. Or it could be that you're having a cup of coffee along with your pastry, and then you're struggling with sugar cravings. Well, think about it. You're not just being reinforced by the sugar and the effects of sugar on dopamine which are real and both conscious and subconscious through the gut to the brain dopamine system and direct on the brain dopamine system. But by coingesting caffeine, you are also further enhancing the reinforcing effects of sugar. The flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine as a way to increase your appetite for certain things. I actually know somebody. I won't reveal who this person is, but they are quite prominent podcaster who ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of in tablet form along with herbal tea and use this as a way to develop a preference for herbal tea because they found that coffee was giving them other effects that weren't good for them. So it works quite well in animals, and it works quite well in insects. And it works quite well in humans. I suppose animals, insects, and humans are all animals at the end of the day, so no surprise there. But it all underscores the extent to which caffeine is an absolutely fascinating molecule. I mean, its ability to offset the sleepiness system, if you will, this adenosine system, and to control our schedules in that way to essentially take a withdrawal against the bank that is adenosine and then pay that back later in the form of getting sleepy later as opposed to when we want to be alert, its ability to enhance focus, alertness, and mood. And if taken after trying to learn something and remember it, to enhance memory, especially. And its ability to increase VO2 max, increased strength. We didn't even talk today about it, but I'll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested in the sorts of doses we talked about earlier. Because its effects on the neuromuscular system and the calcium system associated with neuromuscular exertion and fatigue can increase peak power output and muscle contractability. It's enhancing performance there as well. And, of course, caffeine does a number of other things just generally related to overall and basal level of mood and alertness, not the least of which are these increases in dopamine. So caffeine is really an incredible molecule. It's affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems but not haphazardly. It's increasing dopamine and acetylcholine in the forebrain to increase attention. It's reducing fatigue. It's improving mental and physical performance for some obvious and some not so obvious reasons. And what I think is among the more miraculous and powerful effects of caffeine, it is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer of things, foods, people, and experiences. And it's one that you can leverage in any direction that you like once you understand the way that caffeine exerts those reinforcing properties. So today, I've really tried to cover as much as I could about the mechanisms of caffeine action in the brain and body, as well as tools and schedules and dosages in which you can leverage caffeine in order to meet your physical performance, mental performance, and frankly mental health, and overall health goals.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Lex Fridman Dr. Lex Fridman is an expert in electrical and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds, including computer science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include guests and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu. And he's had numerous guests on who come from the fields of Brazilian jujitsu, both from the coaching side and from the competitor side. He also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense activation and engagement of the mind and/or body. In fact, the Lex Fridman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics such as mental health-- he's had various psychiatrists and other guests on that relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as guest focused on geopolitics and some of the more controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians, he's had scientists, he's had friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would say a 1 in an eight billion ability to find these people, make them comfortable, and in that comfort, both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist, he certainly is that. But he has also become one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet. And if there's anything that really captures the essence of Lex Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share with us, the human experience, and to broaden that experience so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion during today's episode captures the many facets of Lex Fridman, although no conversation, of course, could capture them all. We sit down to the conversation just days after Lex returned from Ukraine, where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment in order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there. You may notice that he carries quite a lot of both, emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet in a very classic Lex Fridman way, you'll notice that he's able to zoom out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses so that first of all, everyone feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learned something new, that is to gain new perspective. Our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science and technology are communicated. We also get into the topics of motivation drive and purpose, both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And I would be remiss if I did not tell you that there would be no Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. I was a fan of the Lex Fridman Podcast long before I was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest. And after our first recording, Lex was the one that suggested that I start a podcast. He only gave me two pieces of advice. The first piece of advice was, start a podcast. And the second piece of advice was that I not just make it me blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say that I at least followed half of his advice, and that I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned a few of the topics covered on today's podcast. But I can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as Lex Fridman. If you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence, engineering, or robotics, today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not, but you are somebody who is interested in world politics, and more importantly, the human experience, both the individual and the collective human experience, Lex shares what can only be described as incredible insights into what he views as the human experience and what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are in LMNT in the correct ratios. But it has no sugar. As I mentioned before on the podcast, electrolytes are critical to the function of every cell in the body, and especially the cells in your brain, meaning neurons or nerve cells. Indeed, the ability for nerve cells to be active and communicate with one another critically depends on sodium, potassium, and magnesium. You can get electrolytes from a variety of sources. But it's often hard to get them in the proper ratios, even from food. So if you're somebody who's exercising a lot and sweating, or if you're somebody following, for instance, a low carbohydrate or even a semi-low carbohydrate diet, that will cause you to excrete electrolytes. I tend to have my LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up or within the first few hours of waking, any time while or after I'm exercising, or I've sweat a lot, such as exiting the sauna. If you'd like to try LMNT you can go to drinkLMNT-- that's LMNT..com/Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkLMNT, LMNT.com/Huberman to my free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. Now blood glucose or blood sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate and long term health, and indeed, your feelings of vigor and mental clarity and well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know how different foods and food combinations and timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels, you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels. And what it taught me, for instance, was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me, for instance, how to space my exercise and my food intake. It turns out for me, exercising fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I learned using Levels. And it's completely transformed, not just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous learning for me that's really shaped an enormous number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical strength and endurance. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/Huberman. Again that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely when we wake up in the morning, that is in large part, because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago. And it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper, I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all, and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/Huberman to save up to $400 off their sleep fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/Huberman. And now for my discussion with Dr. Lex Fridman, welcome back. LEX FRIDMAN: It's good to be back in a bedroom. This feels like a porn set. I apologize to open that way. I've never been in a porn set, so I should admit this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Our studio has being renovated. So here we are for the monumental recording of episode 100-- LEX FRIDMAN: Episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, which was inspired by the Lex Fridman Podcast. Some people already know the story. But I'll repeat it again for those that don't. There would not be a Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. Because after recording as a guest on his podcast a few years ago, he made the suggestion that I start a podcast. And he explained to me how it works. And he said, "You should start a podcast. But just make sure that it's not you blabbing the whole time, Andrew." And I only sort of followed the advice. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, well, you surprised me, surprised the world, that you're able to talk for hours and cite some of the best science going on and be able to give people advice without many interruptions or edits or any of that. I mean, that takes an incredible amount of skill that you're probably born with. And some of it is developed. I mean, the whole science community is proud of you, man. Stanford is proud of you. So yeah, it's a beautiful thing. It was really surprising. Because it's unclear how a scientist can do a great podcast that's not just shooting the shit about random stuff, but really is giving very structured, good advice that's boiling down the state of the art science into something that's actually useful for people. So that was impressive. It's like holy shit, he actually pulled this off. And doing it every week on a different topic-- I mean, I'm usually positive, especially for people I love and support. But damn, I thought, there's no way he's going to be able to pull this off week after week. And it's been only getting better and better and better. Had a whole rant on a recent podcast, I forget with who, of how awesome you are with Rana el Kaliouby. She's a emotion recognition person, AI person. And then she didn't know who you were. And I was like, what the hell do you mean? And I just went on this whole rant of how awesome you are. Is hilarious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm very gratified to hear this. I'm-- it's a little uncomfortable for me to hear but listen, I'm just really happy if people are getting information that they like and can make actionable. And it was inspired by you. And look right back at you. I've followed a number of your structural formats. Attire, I don't wear a tie. I'm constantly reminded about this by my father. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Who says what-- he'd saw my podcast. And he was like, why don't you dress properly like your friend Lex? He literally said that. And it's a debate that goes back and forth. But nonetheless-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does it feel? Episode 100. How does it feel? ANDREW HUBERMAN: You know, I think. LEX FRIDMAN: Can you imagine you're here? You hear after so many episodes and done so much. I mean, the number of hours is just insane. The amount of passion, the amount of work you put into this, what's it feel like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great. And it feels very much like the horizon is still at the same distance in front of me. Every episode, I just try and get information there. And the process that we talked about on your podcast. We won't go into it of collecting information, distilling it down to some simple notes, walking around, listening to music, trying to figure out what the motifs are, and then-- as just like you, I don't use a teleprompter or anything like that. There's very minimal notes. So it feels great, and I love it. And again, I'm just grateful to you for inspiring it. And I just want to keep going and do more of it. And I should say I am also relieved that we're sitting here because you recently went overseas to a very intense war zone, literally, the Ukraine. And the entire time that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. The world's a unpredictable place, in general. And we don't always get the only vote and what happens to us. So first of all, welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. And what was that like? I mean, at a broad level, at a specific level, what drew you there? What surprised you? And how do you think it changed you in coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a lot to say. But first, it is really good to be back. One of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or a part of the world that's going through something difficult, you really appreciate how great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the stable, reliable rule of law. The lack of corruption in that you can trust that if you start a business or if you take on various pursuits in life that there's not going to be at-scale manipulation of your efforts such that you can't succeed. So this kind of capitalism is in it's-- the ideal of capitalism is really still burning bright in this country. And it really makes you appreciate those aspects. And also just the ability to have a home for generations, across generations. So you can have your grandfather live in Kentucky in a certain city. And then his children lived there, and you live there, and then it just continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can have when you don't have war. Because war destroys entire communities. And it destroys histories, generations, like life stories that stretch across the generations. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. I didn't even think about that until you said just now. But photographs, hard drives get destroyed or just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. I mean, nowadays, things exist in the cloud but are still a lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods that are irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural parts of the United States, they don't exist in the cloud, right. A lot of people still, well, even in towns, they still love the physical photo album of your family. A lot of people still store their photographs of families in the VHS tapes and all that kind of stuff, yeah. But I think-- there's so many things I've learned and really felt the lessons. One of which is nobody gives a damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stuff, your house is gone. The thing time and time again I saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the people. They love the friends, the family that are still alive. That's the only thing they talk about. That, in fact, they don't mention actually with much dramatic sort of vigor about the trauma of losing your home. They're just non-stop saying how lucky they are that person X person Y is still here. And that makes you realize that when you lose everything, it's still-- it makes you realize what really matters, which is the people in your life. I mean, a lot of people kind of realize that later in life, when you're facing mortality, when you're facing your death, or you get a cancer diagnosis, that kind of stuff. I think people here in America, in California, with the fires, you you can still lose your home. You are going to realize, like, nah. It doesn't really matter. It's a pain in the ass but what matters is still the family, the people, and so on. I think the most intense thing-- I talked to several hundred people, some of which is recorded. I've really been struggling to put that out because I have to edit it myself. And so you're talking about 30, 40 hours of footage, and it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It is extremely difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN: It's extremely difficult. So I talked to a lot of politicians. The number two in the country, number three. I'll be back there to talk to the president to do a three-hour conversation. Those are easy to edit. They're really heartfelt and thoughtful folks from different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war. But the ones that really hard to edit is like grandmas that are in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope, they still have love. And some of them have-- some of them, many of them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February, when Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I realized about War. One of the most painful one lessons is that war creates generational hate. We sometimes think about war as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. But we don't directly think about the secondary and tertiary effects of that which lasts decades. Which is anyone who's lost the father or a mother or a daughter or a son, they now hate not just the individual soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country but the entirety of the people. So it's not that they hate Vladimir Putin or hate the Russian military. They hate Russian people. So that tears the fabric of a thing that, for me-- my half my family's from Ukraine, half of my family is from Russia. But there is-- I remember the pain the triumph of World War two still resonates through my entire family tree. And so, you remember when the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against this Nazi invasion. You remember a lot of that. And now, to see the fabric of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is really, really difficult. For me, just to realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural, historical aspect. But also, there's so many painful ways in which things will never be the same. Which is we've seen that it's possible to have a major hot war in the 21st century. I think a lot of people are watching this. China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war. And I think the lessons learned from that. Might be the kind that lead to a major World War III in the 21st century. So one of the things I realized watching the whole scene is that we don't know shit about what's going to happen in the 21st century. And it might-- we kind of have this intuition like surely there's not going to be another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like we'll just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And back to normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whatever that is. LEX FRIDMAN: But you have to remember, at the end of World War I, as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars. Nobody ironically, in a dark way, it was also the roaring 20s when people believed this. There will never be another World War. And 20 years after that, the rise of Nazi Germany. A charismatic leader that captivated the minds of millions and built up a military that can take on the whole world. And so it makes you realize that this is still possible. This is still possible. And then the tension. You see this-- the media machine, the propaganda machine, that I've gotten to see every aspect of. It's still fueling that division between America and China. Between Russia and India. And then Africa has a complicated thing that's trying to figure out who are they with, who are they against. And just this tension is building and building. And like it makes you realize like we might-- the thing that might shake human civilization may not be so far off. That's a realization you get to really feel. I mean, there's all kinds of other lessons. And one of which is propaganda. Is I got to-- I get a lot of letters, emails. And some of them are full of really intense language, full of hate from every side toward me. Or, well, the hate is towards me as representing side X. And X stands as a variable for every side. So either I'm a Zelensky show, or I'm a Putin show, or I'm a NATO show, or I'm an America-- America show-- American empire show. Or I'm a Democrat or a Republican. Because it's already been, in this country, politicized. I think there's a sense of Ukraine is this place that's full of corruption. Why are we sending money there? I think that's kind of the messaging on the Republican side. On the Democratic side-- I'm not even keeping track of the actual messaging and the conspiracy theories and the narratives, but they are-- the tension is there. And I get to feel it directly. And what you get to really experience is there's a large number of narratives that all are extremely confident themselves that they know the truth. People are convinced, first of all, that they're not being lied to. People in Russia think there's no propaganda. They think that, yes, yes, there is like state-sponsored propaganda, but we're all smart enough to ignore the lame propaganda that's everywhere. They know that we can think on our own, we know the truth, and everybody kind of speaks in this way. Everybody in the United States says, well, yes, there's mainstream media, they're full of messaging and propaganda, but we're smart. We can think on our own. Of course, we see through that. Everybody says this. And then the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group, whatever that group is. And the more you've lost, the more intense the feeling of hatred. It's a really difficult field to walk through calmly and with an open mind and try to understand what's really going on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's super intense. That's the only words that come to mind as I hear this. You mentioned something that it seems that hate generalizes. It's against an entire group or an entire country. Why do you think it is that hate generalizes and that love may or may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: I've had-- sort of one, as you can imagine, the kind of question I asked is, do you have love or hate in your heart? It's a question I asked almost everybody. And then I would dig into this exact question that you're asking. I think some of the most beautiful things I've heard which is people that are full of hate are able to self-introspect about it. They know they shouldn't feel it, but they can't help it. It's not-- they know that ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone is to feel love for fellow man, but they can't help it. They know. It's like a drug, they say like hate escalates, it's like a vicious spiral. You just can't help it. And the question I also asked is, do you think you'll ever be able to forgive Russia? And after much thought almost-- it's split, but most people will say no. I will never be able to forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And because of the generalization you talked about earlier, that could even include all Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: All Russians. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In that statements, they mean all Russians. LEX FRIDMAN: Because if you do nothing that's as bad or worse than being part of the army that invades. So the people that are just sitting there, the good Germans, the people that are just quietly going on with their lives, you're just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Earlier, you said that going over to the Ukraine now allowed you to realize just so many of the positives of being here in the United States. I have a good friend. We both know him. I won't name him by name, but we've communicated the three of us from tier-one Special Operations. He spent years doing deployments. Really amazing individual. And I remember when the pandemic hit, he said on a text thread you know, Americans aren't used to the government interfering with their plans. Around the world, many people are familiar with governments dramatically interfering with their plans. Sometimes even in a seemingly random way. Here we were not braced for that. I mean, we get speeding tickets, and there's lines to vote and things like that. But I think the pandemic was one of the first times, at least in my life, that I can remember where it really seemed like the government was impeding what people naturally wanted to do. And that was a shock for people here. And I have a what might seem like a somewhat mundane question, but it's something that I saw on social media. A lot of people were asking me to ask you, and I was curious about too. What was a typical day like over there? Were sleeping in a bed, were you sleeping on the ground? Everyone seems to want to know. What were you eating? Were you eating once a day? Were you eating your steak? Or were you-- were you in fairly deprived conditions over there? I saw a couple photos that you posted out of doors in front of rubble. With pith helmet on in one case. What was that typical day like over there? LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two modes. One of them-- I spent a lot of time in Kyiv, which is much safer than-- it may be obvious to state but for people who don't know, it's in the middle of the country, and it's much safer than the actual front. The word the battle is happening. So much, much safer than Kyiv even is Lviv which is the Western part of the country. So the times I spent in Kyiv were fundamentally different than the time I spent at the front. And I went to the Kherson region, which is where a lot of really heated battle was happening. There's several areas. So there's Kharkiv. It's in the Northeast of the country. And then there's Donbas region, which is East of the country. And then there's Kherson region, which, by the way, I'm not good at geography, so is the Southeast of the country. And that's where, at least when I was there, was a lot of really heated fighting happening. So when I was in the Kherson region, it's what you would imagine. The place-- I stayed in a hotel where all the lights have to stay off. So the entire town, all the lights are off. You have to navigate through the darkness and use your phone to shine, and so on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is terrible for the circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly-- I was this-- how can I do this? Where's my element and Athletic Greens? How can I function? No. There's I think it was balanced by the deep appreciation of being alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-- mean, this is the reason that I asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is the reason I ask is we get used to all these creature comforts. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we don't need them, but we often come to depend on them in a way that makes us feel like we need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but very quickly, there's something about the intensity of life that you see in people's eyes because they're living through a war that makes you forget all those creature comforts. And it was actually-- I'm somebody who hates traveling and so on. I love the creature habits. I love-- I love the comfort of the ritual right but all of that was forgotten very quickly. Just the intensity of feeling, the intensity of love that people have for each other, that was obvious. In terms of food-- so there's a curfew. So depends on what part of the country. But usually, you basically have to scamper home like 9:00 PM. So the hard curfew in a lot of places is 11:00 PM at night. But by then, you have to be home. So-- in some places, it's 10:00. So at 9:00 PM, you start going home. Which, for me, was kind of wonderful also because I get to spend-- I get to be forced to spend time alone and think for many hours in wherever I'm staying. Which is really nice. And everywhere there's a calmness and the quietness to the whole thing. In terms of food, once a day. Just the food is incredibly cheap and incredibly delicious. People are still-- one of the things they can still take pride in is making the best possible food they can. So meat-- but they do admire American meat, so the meat is not as great as it could be in that country. But I ate borsch every day, all that kind of stuff. Mostly meat. So spend the entire day-- wake up in the morning with coffee, spend the entire day talking to people. Which for me is very difficult because of the intensity of the story. It's one after the other after the other. We just talk to regular people, talk to soldiers, talk to politicians, all kinds of soldiers. I talked to people there who are doing rescue missions, so Americans. I hung out with Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? The great Tim Kennedy. LEX FRIDMAN: The great Tim Kennedy, who-- also him and many others revealed to me one of the many reasons I'm proud to be an American is how trained and skilled and effective American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess for listeners of this podcast maybe we should familiarize them with who Tim Kennedy is because I realized that a number of them will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: How do you do that? How do you try to summarize a man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. We can be accurate but not exhaustive, as any good data are accurate but not exhaustive. Very skilled and accomplished MMA fighter, very skilled and accomplished former Special Operations member, American Patriot, and podcaster too, right? Does he have his own podcast? LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We know Andy Stumpf has his own podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Which is an amazing podcast. Yeah, Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast with Andy Stumpf. LEX FRIDMAN: But also Tim Kennedy is like the embodiment of America to the most beautiful and the most ridiculous degree. So he's like what you imagine-- what is it, Team America? I just imagine him shirtless on a tank rolling into enemy territory just screaming at the top of his lungs. That's just his personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But not posturing. He actually does the work, as they say. LEX FRIDMAN: So this is the thing. He really embodies that. Now, some of that is just his personality and humor. I'd like to sort of comment on the humor of things, not just with him. There's very one other interesting thing I've learned. But also when he's actually helping people he's extremely good at what he does, which is building teams that rescue, that go into the most dangerous areas of Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, and they get the job done. And one of the things I heard time and time again, which what's really interesting to me, that Ukrainian soldiers said that comparing Ukrainian, Russian, and American soldiers, American soldiers are the bravest, which was very interesting for me to hear given how high the morale is for the Ukrainian soldiers. But that just reveals that training enables you to be brave. So it's not just about how well trained they are and so on, it's how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting. And it makes you realize, this is American army, not just through the technology, especially the special force guys. They're still one of the most effective and terrifying armies in the world. And listen, just for context, I'm somebody who is, for the most part, anti-war, a pacifist. But you get to see some of the realities of war kind of wake you up to what needs to get done to protect sovereignty, to protect some of the values, to protect civilians and homes and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes war has to happen. And I should also mention the Russian side because while I haven't gotten to experience the Russian side yet I do fully plan to travel to Russia, as I've told everybody. I was very upfront with everybody about this. I would like to hear the story of Russians. But I do know from the Ukrainian side, like the grandmas-- I love grandmas. They told me stories that the Russians really-- the ones that entered their villages, they really, really believed they're saving Ukraine from Nazis, from Nazi occupation. So they feel that Ukraine is under control of Nazi organizations and they believe they're saving the country that's their brothers and sisters. I think propaganda and I think truth is a very difficult thing to arrive with in that war zone. I think in the 21st century one of the things you realize that so much of war, even more so than in the past, is an information war. And people that just use Twitter for their source of information might be surprised to know how much misinformation there is on Twitter, like real narratives being sold, and so it's really hard to know who to believe. And through all of that you have to try to keep an open mind and ultimately ignore the powerful and listen to actual citizens, actual people. That's the other maybe obvious lesson is that war is waged by powerful, rich people, and it's the poor people that suffer. And that's just visible time and time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned the fact that people still enjoy food or the pleasure of cooking, or there's occasional humor or maybe frequent humor. I know Jocko Willink has talked about this in warfare in that all the elements of the human spirit and condition still emerge at various times. I find this amazing, and you and I have had conversations about this before, but the aperture of the mind. The classic story that comes to mind is the one of Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela. You put somebody into a small box of confinement and some people break under those conditions and other people find entire stories within a centimeter of concrete that can occupy them, real stories and richness or humor or love or fascination and surprise. And I find this so interesting that the mind is so adaptable. We talked about creature comforts and then lack of creature comforts and the way that we can adapt, and yet, humans are always striving, it seems, or one would hope, for these better conditions to better their conditions. So as you've come back-- and you've been here now back in the States for how long after your trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends on this podcast release but it felt like I've never left, so practically speaking, a couple months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. And we won't be shy. We're recording this mid-September. LEX FRIDMAN: We actually recorded this several years ago so we're anticipating in the future. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is where we're going to start telling you this is a simulation, you and Joe. I'm still trying to figure out what that actually means. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2. I know I speak for many people when I say that we are very happy that you're back. We know that it's not going to be the first and last trip, that there will be others, and that you'll be going to Russia as well and presumably other places as well in order to explore. And I have to say, as a podcaster and as your friend, I was really inspired at your sense of adventure and your sense of not just adventure, but thoughtful, respectful adventure. You understood what you were doing. You weren't just going there to get some wartime footage or something. This wasn't a kick or a thrill. This is really serious and remains serious. So thank you for doing it, and please, next time you go, bring Tim Kennedy again. LEX FRIDMAN: I feel like Tim Kennedy gets you into-- will take you because he really loves going to the most dangerous places and helping people. So I think he'd get me into more trouble than it's worth. And I should mention that, I mean, there's many reasons I went, but it's definitely not something I take lightly or want to do again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: So I'm doing things that I don't want to do, I just feel like I have to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're compelled. LEX FRIDMAN: So I don't think there's-- now I'll definitely talk about it, as we all should. There's different areas of the world that are seeing a lot of suffering. Yemen. There's so many atrocities going on in the world today, but this one is just personal to me so I want to-- I feel like I'm qualified just because of the language. So most of the talking, by the way, I was doing, it was in Russian. And so because of the language, because of my history, I felt like I had to do this particular thing. I think it's, in many ways, stupid and dangerous, and that was made clear to me. But I do many things of this nature because the heart pulls towards that. But also there's a freedom to not-- I'm afraid of death, but I think there's a freedom to-- it's almost like, OK, if I die, I want to take full advantage of not having a family currently. I feel like when you have a family there's a responsibility for others so you immediately become more conservative and careful. I feel like I want to take full advantage of this particular moment in my life when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you should definitely reproduce at some point. Maybe before next time you should just freeze some sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: Is that what you do with ice baths? Is how that works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: You know, it's interesting. There's always an opportunity to do some science protocols. You know that there are products on the internet, and there are actually a few decent manuscripts looking at how cold exposure can increase testosterone levels, but it doesn't happen by the cold directly. Good scientists, as the authors of those papers, were and are, realized that it's the vasoconstriction and then the vasodilation. As people warm up again there's increased blood flow to the testicles, and in women it seems there's probably increased blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people warm back up. So that seems to cause some sort of hyper nourishment of the various cells, the Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testes that lead to increased output of testosterone and in women testosterone as well. So the cold exposure in any case is obviously a-- do you do the ice bath? Are you into that? LEX FRIDMAN: I've not done that yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As a Russian you probably consider that a hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's a nice thing to have fun with every once in a while to warm up. No, I haven't done that. Been kind of waiting to maybe do it together with you at some point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. LEX FRIDMAN: Because we have a guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one here. It'll be straightforward for you. I always say that the adrenaline comes in waves, and so if you just think about it walls, like you're going through a number of walls of adrenaline as opposed to going for time, it becomes rather trivial. With your jujitsu background and what you'll immediately recognize the physiological sensation. Even though it's cold specifically, it's the adrenaline that makes you want to hop out of the thing. LEX FRIDMAN: And you've seen Joe's. So Joe set up a really nice man cave-- or it's not even a cave because it's so big. It's like a network of man caves. But it has a ice bath and a sauna next to each other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of those here, ice bath and sauna. So we'll have to get you in it one of these days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although there is a-- I don't know the underlying physiological basis but there does seem to be a trend toward truth telling in the sauna. Some people will refer to them as truth barrels. Mine's a barrel sauna shaped like a barrel. Who knows why? Maybe under intense heat duress people just feel compelled to share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have a complicated relationship with saunas because of all the weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of the deepest suffering-- sorry to interrupt-- I've done was in the sauna. It's very-- I mean, I've gone to some dark places in a sauna because, I mean, I wrestled my whole life, judo, jujitsu, and those weights cuts can really test the mind. So you're-- truth telling. Yeah, it's a certain kind of truth telling because you're sitting there and the clock moves slower than it has ever moved in your life. Yeah. So I usually, for the most part, I would try to have a bunch of sweats, garbage bags, and all that kind of stuff, and run. It's easier because you can distract the mind. In the sauna you can't distract the mind. It's just and all the excuses and all the weaknesses in your mind just coming to the surface, and you're just sitting there and sweating-- or not sweating. That's the worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk about visual aperture. You're in a small box so it also inspires some claustrophobia even if you're not claustrophobic. That's absolutely true. And the desire to just get out of the thing is where you get a pretty serious adrenaline surge from in the sauna as well. Now, the sauna actually will-- it won't deplete testosterone but it kills sperm. So for people that-- sperm are on a 60 day sperm cycle so if you're trying to donate sperm-- because that's what got us on to this-- or fertilize an egg or eggs in whatever format, dish or in vivo, as we say in science, which means-- well, you can look it up, folks. The 60 day sperm cycle. So if you go into a really hot sauna or a hot bath or a hot tub, in 60 days those sperm are going to be-- a significantly greater portion of them will be dead, will be non-viable. So there's a simple solution. People just put ice pack down there or a jar, not this jar, but a jar of cold fluid between their legs and just sit there, or they go back and forth between the ice bath and the sauna. But you probably-- if you're going to go back over there you should freeze sperm. We're going to do a couple episodes on fertility when it's relatively inexpensive. And you're young so you probably do it now because there is a association with autism as males get older. It's not a strong one. It's significant but it's still a small contribution to the autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: As you age don't sperm get wiser or no? There's no science to back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men can conceive healthy children at a considerable age. But in any case-- but no, they don't get wiser. What happens is interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a little bit like the maturation of the brain in the sense that some of the sperm get much better at swimming and then many of them get less good. Motility is a strong correlate of the DNA of the sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: This is probably a good time to announce that I'm selling my sperm as an NFTs. I wanted to see how much that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding the crypto wave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your children, your future children and my future children, are supposed to do jujitsu together since I've only done the one jujitsu class so I'm strongly vested in you having children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But only in the friendly kind of way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind of way. Yeah. Dominance of the clan. Yep. For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving on to science, but still with our minds in the Ukraine. Did you encounter any scientists or see any universities? As we know, in this country and in Europe and elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. You need buildings, you need laboratories, you need robots, you need a lot of equipment, and you need minus 80 freezers and you need incubators and you need money and you need technicians. And typically it's been the wealthier countries that have been able to do more research for sake of research and development and prioritization. Certainly the Ukraine had some marvelous universities and marvelous scientists. What's going on with science and scientists over there? And gosh, can we even calculate the loss of discovery that is occurring as a consequence of this conflict? LEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on. Before the war Ukraine had a very vibrant tech sector, which means engineering and all that kind of stuff, and Kyiv has a lot of excellent universities and they still go on. The biggest hit, I would say, is not the infrastructure of the science, but the fact, because of the high morale, everybody is joining the military. So everybody is going to the front to fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, would be fighting, and not because you have to but because you want to. And everybody you know would be really proud that you're fighting, even though everyone tries to convince, Andrew Huberman, you have much better ways to contribute. There's deep honor in fighting for your country, yes, but there are better ways to contribute to your country than just picking up a gun that you're not that trained with and going to the front. Still, they do it. Scientists, engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women? LEX FRIDMAN: Actors-- men and women. Obviously, primarily men, but men and women. Much more than you would see in other militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody wants to fight. Everybody's proud of fighting. There's no discussion of pacifism. Should we be fighting? Is this right? Is this-- everybody's really proud of fighting. So there's this kind of black hole that pulls everything, all the resources, into the war effort that's not just financial but also psychological. So it's like if you're a scientist it feels like what-- it feels almost like you're dishonoring humanity by continuing to do things you were doing before. There's a lot of people that converted to being soldiers. They literally watch a YouTube video of how to shoot a particular gun, how to arm a drone with a grenade. If you're a tech person you know how to work with drones so you're going to use that, use whatever skills you got, figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them to help the effort on the front. And so that's a big hit. But that said, I've talked to a lot of folks in Kyiv-- faculty primarily in the tech economics space, so I didn't get a chance to interact with folks who are on the biology, chemistry, neuroscience side of things, but that still goes on. So one of the really impressive things about Ukraine is that they're able to maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, all that kind of stuff, education, while the war is going on, especially in Kyiv. The war started where nobody knew whether Kyiv was going to be taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And a lot of experts from outside were convinced that Russia would take Kyiv, and they didn't. And one of the really impressive things as a leader-- one of the things I really experienced is that a lot of people criticized Zelenskyy before the war. He only had about 30% approval rate. A lot of people didn't like Zelenskyy. But one of the great things he did as a leader, which I'm not sure many leaders would be able to do, is when Kyiv was clearly being invaded he chose to stay. He stayed in the capital. Everybody, all the American military, the intelligence agencies, NATO, his own staff, advisors all told him to flee, and he stayed. And so I think that was a beacon, a symbol for the rest, for the universities, for science, for the infrastructure that we're staying too, and that kept the whole thing going. There's an interesting social experiment that happened, I think for folks who are interested in gun control in this country in particular, is one of the decisions they made early on is to give guns to everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early on in the war? LEX FRIDMAN: Early on in the war, yeah. So everybody got a gun. They also released a bunch of prisoners from prison because there was no staff to keep the prisons running. And so there's a very interesting psychological experiment of, like, how is this going to go? Everybody has a gun. Are they going to start robbing places? Are they going to start taking advantage of a chaotic situation? And what happened is that crime went to zero. So it turned out that this, as an experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a case where love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or at least hate did not. We don't know if it's love or it's sort of lack of initiative for common culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I don't-- right. I think that's very correct to say that it wasn't hate that was unifying people. It was love of country, love of community. It's probably the same thing that will happen to humans when aliens invade as well. It's the common effort. Everybody puts everything else to the side. Plus just the sheer amount of guns is similar to Texas. You realize, well, there's going to be a self-correcting mechanism very quickly because the rule of law was also put aside, right? Basically the police force lost a lot of power because everybody else has guns and they're kind of taking the law into their own hands. That system, at least in this particular case in this particular moment in human history, worked. It's an interesting lesson, you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. I had an interesting contrast that I'll share with you because you mentioned Texas. So not so long ago I was in Austin. I often visit you or others in Austin, as you know. And many doors that I walked past, including a school, said no firearms past this point. It was a sticker on the door. You see this on hospitals sometimes. I saw this at Baylor College of Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common to see in Texas, not so common in California. And then I flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, was walking by an elementary school in my old neighborhood, and saw a similar sticker and looked at it and it said, no peanuts or other allergy containing foods past this point on the door of this elementary school. So quite a different contrast, guns and peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, are very serious for some people, although there's great research out of Stanford showing that early exposure to peanuts can prevent the allergies. But don't start rubbing yourself in peanut butter, folks, if you have a peanut allergy. That's not the best way to deal with it. In any case, the contrast of what's dangerous, the contrast of the familiarity with guns versus no familiarity. In Israel and elsewhere you see machine guns in the airport. In Germany, Frankfurt, you see machine guns in the airport. Not so common in the United States. So again, I feel like there's this aperture of vision. There's this aperture of pleasures versus creature comforts and lack of creature comforts, and then there's this aperture of danger, right? People who are familiar with guns are familiar with people coming in and setting their firearm on the table and eating dinner, you know? But if you're not accustomed to that it's jarring, right? LEX FRIDMAN: I should mention-- people know this throughout human history-- but the human ability to get assimilated now, get used to violence is incredible. So you could be living in a peaceful time, like we're here now, and there would be one explosion, like a 9/11 type of situation. That would be a huge shock. It's terrifying. Everybody freaks out. The second one is a huge drop off in how freaked out you get. And in a matter of days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal. I've talked to so many people in Kharkiv, which is one of the towns that's seen a lot of heated battle. You ask them, is it safe there? In fact, when I went to the-- closer and closer to the war zone you ask people, is it safe? And their answer's usually, yeah, it's pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's all signal to noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody has told me except Western reporters sitting in the West Side of Ukraine, it's really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, it's good. My uncle just died yesterday. He was shot. But it's pretty good. The farm is still running. How do I put it? They focus on the positive, that's one. But there's a deeper truth there, which is just get used to difficult situations and the stuff that make you happy and the stuff that make you upset is relative to that new normal that you establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I grew up in California and there were a lot of earthquakes. I remember the '89 quake, I remember the Embarcadero Freeway pancaking on top of people and cars. I remember I moved to Southern California, there was a Northridge quake. Wherever I move there seem to be earthquakes. I never worry about earthquakes, ever. I just don't. In fact, I don't like the destruction they cause, but every once in a while an earthquake will roll through and it's kind of exciting. It sounds like a train coming through. It's like, wow, like the Earth is moving. You know? Again, I don't want anyone to get harmed, but I enjoy a good rumble coming through nonetheless. It's signal to noise. But if I saw a tornado I'd freak out, and people from the Midwest are probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable, the great wrestler from the Midwest that you know and I've never met but I have great respect for, he's probably-- sees a tornado and is like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah. You know? So I think signal to noise is real. Before I neglect, although I won't forget, speaking of signal to noise and environment, you are returning to or have gone back to one of your original natural habitats, which is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's actually difficult to pronounce in full. MIT, right? So you've been spending some time there teaching and doing other things. Tell us what you're up to with MIT recently. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I'm really glad that you, being on the West Coast, know the difference between Boston, New York. I feel like a lot of people think it's like the East Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very different, especially the Bostonians and New Yorkers. LEX FRIDMAN: They get very aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I love it. I gave lectures there in front of a in person crowd. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What were you talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: For the AI, so different aspects of AI and robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. So for people who know the artificial intelligence field they usually don't use the term AI, and people from outside AIs. The biggest breakthroughs in the machine learning field with some discussion of robotics and so on. Yeah. It was in person. It was wonderful. I'm a sucker for that. I really avoided teaching or any kind of interaction during COVID because people put a lot of emphasis on but also got comfortable with remote teaching, and I think nobody enjoyed it. Except there's a notion that it's much easier to do because you don't have to travel. You can do it in your pajamas kind of thing. But when you actually get to do it, you don't get the same kind of joy that you do when you're teaching. As a student you don't get the same kind of joy of learning. It's not as effective and all that kind of stuff. So to be in person together with people, to see their eyes, to get their excitement, to get the questions and all the interactions, that was awesome. And I'm still a sucker and a believer in the ideal of MIT, of the University. I think it's an incredible place. There's something in the air still. But it really hit-- the pandemic hit universities hard because-- and I can say this. This is not you saying it. This is me saying it. That administrations-- as in all cases when people criticize institutions, the pandemic has given more power to the administration and taken away power from the faculty and the students, and that's from everybody involved, including the administration. That's a concern because a university is about the teachers and the students. That should be primary. And whenever you have a pandemic there's an opportunity to increase the amount of rules. One of the things that really bothered me, and I'll scream from the top of the MIT dome, about this is they've instituted a new temp ticket system. Which is if you're a visitor to the campus at MIT, you have to register. You have to, first of all, show that you're vaccinated, but more importantly, there's a process to visiting. You need to get permission to visit. One of the reasons I loved MIT, unlike some other institutions, MIT just leaves the door open to anyone. In classrooms you can roll in the ridiculous characters. The students that are usually doing business stuff or economics can roll into a physics class and just-- you're kind of not allowed but it's a gray area so you let that happen, and that creates a flourishing of a community that was beautiful. And I think adding extra rules puts a squeeze on and limits some of the flourishing, and I hope some of that dissipates over time as we kind of let go of the risk aversion that was created by the pandemic. As we kind of enter the normal return back some of that flourishing can happen. But when you're actually in there with the students, it was magic. I love it. I love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, some of your earliest videos on your YouTube channel were of you in the classroom, right? That's how this all started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Yeah. That's how YouTube-- putting stuff on YouTube is terrifying, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, especially at the time when you did it. Again, you're a pioneer in that sense. You did that, Jordan Peterson did that. Putting up lectures is-- yeah. I teach still. Every winter I teach-- direct a course, and I'll be doing even more teaching going forward. But the idea of those videos being on the web is-- yeah, that spikes my cortisol a little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It's terrifying because you get-- and everybody has a different experience. For me being a junior research scientist the kind of natural concern is like, who am I? And when I was giving this lecture it's like, I don't deserve any of this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's your humility coming through, and I actually think that humility on the part of an instructor is good because those that think that they are entitled, and who else could give this lecture? Then I worry more. I once heard-- I don't know if it's still true-- that at Caltech, the great California Institute of Technology not far from here, that many of the faculty are actually afraid of the students. Not physically afraid, but they're intellectually afraid because the students are so smart. And teaching there can be downright frightening, I've heard. But that's great. Keeps everybody on their toes. And you know, I've been corrected in lecture before at Stanford and elsewhere. When my lab was at UC San Diego where someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture you said this and now you said that-- or on the podcast. You know? And I think it's that moment where you sometimes feel that urge to defend and you go, oh, you're right, and I think it depends on how one was trained. My graduate advisor was wonderful at saying, I don't know, all the time. And she went to Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech. Brilliant woman. And had no problem saying, I don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't have that problem either. So I usually have two guys that somebody speaks up, grab them, drag them out of the room, never see them again. So everybody is really supportive. You don't understand that the amount of love and support I get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially when the last few students are there and everybody seems to be nodding as you're going. No, I think that I'd love to sit-in on one of your lectures. I know very little about AI, machine learning, or robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: Have you ever talked at MIT? Have you ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. When I went on the job market as a faculty member my final two choices were between MIT Picower-- I had an on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place to do neuroscience. And UC San Diego, which is a wonderful neuroscience program. In the end it made sense for me be on the West Coast for personal reasons, but there's some amazing neuroscience going on there. Goodness. And that's always been true and is going to continue. It's been a long time since I've been invited back there. Oddly enough when I started doing more podcasting-- and I still run a lab but I shrunk my lab considerably as I've done more podcasting-- I've received fewer academic lecture invites, which makes sense. But now they're sort of coming back. And so when people invite now I always say, do you want me to talk about the ventral thalamus and its role in anxiety and aggression or do you want me to talk about the podcast? And my big fear is I'm going to go back to give a lecture about the retina or something and I'll start off with an Athletic Greens read or something like that just reflexively. Just kidding. That wouldn't happen. But listen, I think it's great to continue to keep a foot in both places. I was so happy to hear that you're teaching at MIT because podcasting is one thing, teaching is another, and there's overlap there in the Venn diagram. But listen, the students that get to sit-in on one of your lectures-- and you may see me sitting there in the audience soon when I creep into your class. LEX FRIDMAN: In sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Wearing a red shirt. You won't recognize me. Are certainly receiving a great gift. I've watched your lectures on YouTube, even the early ones, and listen, I know you to be a phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, there's something about-- so I'm also doing-- I stayed up pretty late last night working for a deadline on a paper. One of the things that I hope to do for hopefully the rest of my life is to continue publishing, and I think it's really important to do that even if you continue the podcast because you want to be just on your own intellectual and scientific journey as you do podcasting. At least for me, and especially on the engineering side because I want to build stuff, and I think that keeps your ego in check, keeps you humble because I think if you talk too much on a microphone you start getting-- you might lose track of the grounding that comes from engineering and from science and the scientific process and the criticisms that you get, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And how slow and iterative it is. We have two papers right now that are in the revision stage, and it's been a very long road. And I was asked this recently because I met with my chairman. He said, do you want to continue to run a lab or are you just going to go full time on the podcast? And Stanford has been very supportive, I must say, as I know MIT has been of you. And I said, oh, I absolutely want to continue to be involved in research and do research. And when you start talking about these papers and we're looking over my-- this was my yearly review and looking back I'm like, goodness, these papers have been in play for a very long time. So it's a long road but you learn more and more, and the more time you spend myopically looking at a bunch of data the more you learn and the more you think. I totally agree. Talking to these devices for podcasts is wonderful because it's fun. It relieves a certain itch that we both have and hopefully it lands some important information out there for people, but doing research is the-- I guess if you know, you know. There's the unpeeling of the onion, knowing that there could be something there. There's just nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: I mean, you do-- especially with the pandemic. And for me, both Twitter and the podcast have made me much more impatient about the slowness of the review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will do that. LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. But even with podcast you have a cool-- you'll find something cool and then you have ideas and you'll just say them and they'll be out pretty quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Then we do a post right now about something that we both found interesting and it's out in the world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: And you can write up something, like there is a culture in computer science of posting stuff on arXiv and preprints that don't get annual review, and sometimes they don't even go through the review process ever because people just start using them if it's code. And it's like, what's the point of this? It works. It's self evident that it works because people are using it, and that I think applies more to engineering fields because it's an actual tool that works. It doesn't matter if-- you don't have to scientifically prove that it works. It works because it's using for a lot of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry to interrupt, but I just-- for point of reference, the famous paper describing the double helix which earned Watson and Crick the Nobel Prize and should have earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too, of course, but they got it for the structure of DNA of course. That paper was never reviewed at Nature. They published it because its importance was self evident, or whatever. They decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: So the editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was that purely editorial decision, I believe. I mean, that's what I was told by someone who's currently an editor at Nature. If that turns out to not be correct someone will tell us in the comments for sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's pretty interesting, right? LEX FRIDMAN: That's really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps the most significant discovery in biology and bioengineering which was leading to bioengineering as well, of course, of the last century was not peer reviewed. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- so Eric Weinstein, but many others have talked about this, which is, I mean, I don't think people understand how poor the peer review process is. Just the amount of-- because you think peer review it means all the best peers get together and they review your stuff, but it's unpaid work and it's usually a small number of people. And they have a very select perspective so they might not be the best person, especially if it's super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's who has time to do it. I'm on a bunch of editorial boards still. Why, I don't know, but I enjoy the peer review process and sending papers out. Oftentimes the best scientists are very busy and don't have time to review. And oftentimes the more premiere journals will select from a kind of a unique kit of very good scientists who are very close to the work, sometimes the people are very far from the work. It really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: And both have negatives, right? If you're very close to the work there's jealousy, and all those basic human things. Very far from the work you might not appreciate the nuanced contribution, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there's psychology. Sorry to interrupt again, but a good friend of mine who's extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera, always told me that they-- I won't even say whether or not who they are. They select their reviewers on the basis of who has been publishing very well recently because they assume that that person is going to be more benevolent because they have been doing well so that the love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: That's a good point to that, actually. But the idea is that editors might actually be the best reviewers, so that was the traditional-- that's the thing I wanted to mention that Eric Weinstein talks about, that back several decades ago editors had much more power. And there is something to be made for that because editors are the ones who are responsible for crafting the journal. They really are invested in this, and they're also often experts, right? It makes sense for an editor to have a bit of power in this case. Usually if an idea is truly novel you could see it, And so it makes sense for an editor to have more power in that regard. Of course for me, I think peer review should be done the way tweets are done, which is crowdsourced or Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let the crowd decide. LEX FRIDMAN: Let the crowd decide, and let the crowd add depth and breadth and context for the contribution. So if the paper overstates the degree of contribution, the crowd will check you on that. If there's not enough support or the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, the crowd will check you on that. There could be, of course, political bickering that enters the picture, especially on very controversial topics, but I think I trust the intelligence of human beings to figure that out. And I think most of us are trying to figure this whole process out. I just wish it was happening much faster because on the important topics, the review cycle could be faster. And we learned that through COVID that Twitter was actually pretty effective at doing science communication. It was really interesting. Some of the best scientists took to Twitter to communicate their own work and other people's work, and always putting into the caveats that it's not peer reviewed and so on, but it's all out there and the data just moves so fast. And if you want stuff to move fast, Twitter is the best medium of communication for that. It's cool to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and, indeed, optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get $200 off an ultimate plan or 34% off the entire site as a special Black Friday deal now through the end of November. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman, and use the code Huberman at checkout. I'm now on Twitter more regularly, and initially it was just Instagram. And I remember you and I used to have these over dinner or drink conversations where I'd say, I don't understand Twitter. And you'd say, I don't understand Instagram. And of course, we understand how it worked and how to work each respective platform, but I think we were both trying to figure out what is driving the psychology of these different venues because they are quite distinct psychologies for whatever reason. I think I'm finally starting to understand Twitter and enjoy it a little bit. Initially I wasn't prepared for the level of reflexive scrutiny. It sounds a little bit oxymoronic, but that people pick up on one small thing and then drive it down that trajectory. It didn't seem to be happening quite as much on Instagram, but I love your tweets. I do have a question about your Twitter account and how you-- do you have sort of internal filters of what you'll put up and won't put up? Because sometimes you'll put up things that are about life and reflections. Other times you'll put up things like what you're excited about in AI, or of course, point to various podcasts including your own, but others as well. How do you approach social media? Not in how do you regulate your behavior on there in terms of how much time, et cetera. I know you've talked about that before. But you know, what's your mindset around social media when you go on there to either post or forage or respond to information? LEX FRIDMAN: I think I try to add some-- not the sound cliche, but some love out there into the world into, as OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. I think there is this viral negativity that can take hold, and I try to find the right language to add good vibes out there. And it's actually really, really tricky because there's something about positivity that sounds fake. I can't quite put my finger on it, but whenever I talk about love and positive and almost childlike in my curiosity and positivity, people start to think, surely he has skeletons in the closet. There's dead bodies in his basement. This must be a fake-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, it's the attic. LEX FRIDMAN: It's the attic? ANDREW HUBERMAN: The attic. LEX FRIDMAN: I keep mine in the basement. That's the details. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was referring to your attic. I don't have an attic or a basement, nor dead bodies. I just want to be very clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I do have an attic and actually I haven't been up there. Maybe there is bodies up there. But yes, I prefer the basement. It's colder down there. I like it. No, but there's an assumption that this is not genuine or it's disingenuous in some kind of way. And so I try to find the right language for that kind of stuff, how to be positive. Some of it I was really inspired by Elon's approach to Twitter. Not all of it, but when he just is silly. I found that silliness-- I think it's Hermann Hesse said something to paraphrase-- one of my favorite writers-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: I think in Steppenwolf said, learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. I think I try to be silly, laugh at myself, laugh at the absurdity of life, and then in part when I'm serious, try to just be positive, just to see a positive perspective. And also, as you said, people pick out certain words and so on and they attack each other, attack me over certain usage of words in a particular tweet. I think the thing I try to do is think positively towards them, like do not escalate. So whenever somebody's criticizing me and so on, I just smile. If there's a lesson to be learned, I learn it and then I just send good vibes their way. Don't respond, and just hopefully, through karma and through the ripple effect of positivity, have an impact on them and the rest of the Twitter. And what you find is that builds-- your actions create the community. So how I behave gets me surrounded by certain people. But lately, especially Ukraine is one topic like this, I also thought about talking to-- somebody who reached out to me is Andrew Tate, who's extremely controversial. From the perspective of a lot of people is a misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've heard his name and I know that there's a lot of controversy around him. Maybe you could familiarize me. I've been pretty nose down in podcast prep and I tried to do this vacation thing for about three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: I've heard about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And it sort of worked. I did get some time in the Colorado wilderness by myself, which was great. I did get some downtime. But in any event, it mainly consisted of reading and-- LEX FRIDMAN: And nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading and nature, sauna, ice bath, working out, good food, a little extra sleep, these kinds of things I really felt I needed it. But I am pretty naive when it comes to the kind of current controversies but I've heard his name, and I think he's been deplatformed on a couple of platforms. Do I have that right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's been-- so I should also admit that while I might know more than you, it's not by much. So it's like a five-year-old talking to a four-year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he an athlete, a podcaster? LEX FRIDMAN: So basic summary, he used to be a fighter, a kickboxer, I believe. Was pretty successful. And then during that and after that I think he was on a reality show, and he had all these programs that are basically pickup artist advice. He has this community of people where he gives advice on how to pick up women, how to be successful in relationships, how to make a lot of money, and it costs money to enter those programs. So a lot of the criticism that he gets is kind of-- it's like a pyramid scheme where you convince people to join so that they can make more money and then they convince others to join, and that kind of stuff. But that's not why I'm interested in talking to him. I'm interested because one of the guests-- maybe I should mention who, but one of the female guests I had, really a big scientist, said that her two kids that are 13 and 12 really look up to Andrew to entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it male children, female children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. And I hear this time and time again. So he is somebody that a lot of teens, young teens, look up to. So I haven't done serious research. I usually try to avoid doing research until I agree to talk and then I go deep. But there is an aspect to the way he talks about women that, while I understand and I understand certain dynamics in relationships work for people and he's one such person, but I think him being really disrespectful towards women is not what I-- it's not how I see what it means to be a good man. So the conversation I want to have with him is about masculinity. What does masculinity mean in the 21st century? And so when I think about that kind of stuff, and because we're talking about Twitter, it's like going into a war zone. I'm a happy go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're like, send me to Ukraine, but I don't want to have this conversation on Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: Because it's a really, really, really tricky one because also, as you know, when you do a podcast, everybody wants you to win. It's everything you do is positive. Maybe you'll say the wrong thing as inaccurate thing and you can correct yourself. With Andrew Tate, with Donald Trump, with folks like this, you have to-- I mean, it's a professional boxing. I think you have to push the person. You have to be really eloquent. You have to be also empathetic because you can't just do what journalists do, which is talk down to the person the entire time. That's easy. The hard thing is to empathize with the person, to understand them, to steel man their case, but also to make your own case. So in that case about what it means to be a man, to me a strong man is somebody who is respectful to women. Not out of weakness, not out of social justice warrior signaling, and all that kind of stuff, but out of that's what a strong man does. They don't need to be disrespectful to prove their position in life. He is often-- now, a lot of people say it's a character. He's being misogynistic. He's being a misogynist as a kind of-- for entertainment purposes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So like an avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. But to me, that avatar has a lot of influence on young folks so the character has impact. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I don't think you can separate the avatar and the person in terms of the impact, as you said. In fact, there are a number of accounts on Twitter and Instagram and elsewhere which people have only revealed their first names or they give themself another name or they're using a cartoon image. And part of that, I believe, in at least from some of these individuals who actually know who they are, I understand as an attempt to maintain their privacy, which is important to many people. And in some cases so that they can be more inflammatory and then just pop up elsewhere as something else without anyone knowing that it's the same person. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of-- this is the dark stuff. I've been reading a lot about Ukraine and Nazi Germany, so the '30s and the '40s and so on, and you get to see how much the absurdity turns to evil quickly. One of the things I worry-- one of the things I really don't like to see on Twitter and the internet is how many statements end with LOL. It's like you think just because something is kind of funny or is funny or is legitimately funny, it also doesn't have a deep effect on society. So that's such a difficult gray area because some of the best comedy is dark and mean, but it reveals some important truth that we need to consider. But sometimes comedy is just covering up for destructive ideology, and you have to know the line between those two. Hitler was seen as a joke in the late '20s and the '30s in Nazi Germany until the joke became very serious. You have to be careful to know the difference between the joke and the reality and do all that. I mean, in a conversation-- I'm just such a big believer in conversation to be able to reveal something through conversation, but I don't know. One of the big-- you and I challenge ourselves all the time. I don't know if I have what it takes to have a good, empathetic, but adversarial conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I need to learn more about this Tate person, or not learn about them. Yeah. It sounds like maybe it's something to skip. I don't know because, again, I'm not familiar with the content. But I was going to ask you whether or not you've seeked out or whether or not you would ever consider having Donald Trump as a guest on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've talked to Joe a lot about this and I really believe I can have a good conversation with Donald Trump, but I haven't seen many good conversations with him. So part of me thinks-- part of me believes it's possible, but he often effectively runs over the interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You could sit him down, give him an element in Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio you've got and a different side might come out. Context is powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's really good at this, which is relaxing the person. Like here, have a drink. Smoke a joint, or whatever it is. But this energy of just, let's relax, and there's laughter and so on. I don't think-- as people know, I'm just not good at that kind of stuff. So I think the way I could have a good conversation with him is to really understand his worldview, be able to steel man his worldview and those that support him. Which is, I'm sorry to say for people who seem to hate Donald Trump, is a very large percentage of the country. And so you have to really empathize with those people. You have to empathize with Donald Trump, the human being, and from that perspective, ask him hard questions. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So who do you think is the counterpoint if you're going to seek balance in your guests. If you're going to have Trump on, then you have to have who on? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems to be strongly associated with counter values, at least in the eye of the public. I think he's retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's retiring. So that's really interesting, Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, but I don't think he's a counterbalance. He's a complicated, fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust, but also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. LEX FRIDMAN: And love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. I mean, I know people, not even necessarily scientists, who have pro-Fauci shirts. I've seen people with anti-Fauci shirts, excuse me, certainly, but who adore him. There are people who adore him in the same way there are people that adore Trump. It's so interesting that one species of animal you get such divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: It almost feels like it's by design and every single topic we find tension and division is fascinating to watch. I mean, I got to really witness it from zero to a hundred in Ukraine, where there is not huge significant division. There was in certain parts of Ukraine, but across Europe, across the world there was not that much division between Russia and Ukraine, and it was just born overnight, this intense hatred. You see the same kind of stuff with Fauci over the pandemic. At first we were all huddled in uncertainty. There is a togetherness with the pandemic. Of course, there is more difficult because you're isolated. But then you start to figure out-- probably the politicians and the media try to figure out, how can I take a side here and how can I now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong? And so I think Anthony Fauci is a part of just being used as a scapegoat for certain things as part of that kind of narrative of division. But I think-- so Trump is a singular figure that, to me, represents something important in American history. I'm not sure what that is, but I think you have to think-- you put on your historian hat, go forward in time, and think back. How will he be remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now? Who is the opposite of that? You have to-- I would really have to think about that because Trump was so singular. I think AOC is an interesting one, but she's so young it's unclear to know how-- if she represents a legitimately large scale movement or not. Bernie Sanders is an interesting option, but I wish he would be 30, 40 years younger. The young Bernie would be a good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are scientists working on that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not him specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. We never know. There is a big conspiracy theory that Putin is-- that that's a body double. It's no longer him. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie is Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a hard time merging that image. LEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. That the Putin we see on camera today is a body double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing that in science, and in particular, in anatomy, there's a classification scheme for different types of anatomists, which they either say you're a lumper or a splitter. Some people like to call a whole structure something, not necessarily just for simplicity but for a lot of reasons. And then other people like to microdivide the nucleus into multiple names. And of course, people used to be able to name different brain structures after themselves. So that would be the nucleus of Lex and the Huberman vesiculus or whatever. Less of that nowadays. And by the way, those structures don't actually exist just yet. We haven't defined those yet. I was making those names up. But what's interesting is it seems like in the last five years, there's been a lot of trend-- there's been a trend, excuse me, toward a requirement for lumping. You can't say-- it seems that it's not allowed, if you will, to say, hey, yeah, you know-- and here I'm not stating my-- I will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for hopefully obvious reasons. Some people will say vaccines, yes, but masks, no. Or vaccines and masks, yes, but let people work. And other people will say, no, everyone stay home. And then other people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let everybody work. No one was saying no vaccines, no masks, and stay home, I don't think. So there's this sort of lumping, right? The boundaries around ideology really did start to defy science. I mean, it wasn't scientific. It was one part science-ish at times and sometimes really hardcore science. Other times it was politics, economics. I mean, we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use very different criteria to evaluate the world. I mean, as a scientist, I remember when the vaccines first came out and I asked somebody, one of the early concerns I had that was actually satisfied for me was, how does this thing turn off? If you start generating mRNA, how does it actually get turned off? So I asked a friend, they know a lot about RNA biology. And I said, you know, how does it turn off? They explained it to me and I was like, OK, makes sense. I asked some other questions. But most people aren't going to think about it at that level of detail necessarily, but it did seem that there was just kind of amorphous blobs of ideology that they grabbed on to things and then there was this need for a chasm between them. It was almost felt like it became illegal, in some ways, to want two of the things from that menu and one of the things from that menu. I really felt like I was being constrained by a kind of like Bento box model where I didn't get to define what was in the Bento box. I could either have Bento box A or Bento box Z, but nothing in between. LEX FRIDMAN: And I think on that topic and I think a lot of topics, most people are in the middle with humility, uncertainty, and they're just kind of trying to figure it out. And I think there is just the extremes defining the nature of this division. So I think it's the role of a lot of us in our individual lives, and also if you have a platform of any kind, I think you have to try to walk in the middle with the empathy and humility. And that's actually what science is about is the humility. I'm still thinking about who's the opposite of Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe there is none. I mean, maybe Fauci is orthogonal to Trump. I mean, not everything has an opposite. I mean, maybe he's an n of 1 maybe he's in the minority of one because he was an outsider from Washington who then made it there. LEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder-- you have to pick your battles because every battle you fight you should take very seriously. And just the amount of hate I get, I got, and I still get for having sat down with the Pfizer CEO, that was a very valuable lesson for me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that one got you a lot of heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it still does because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you had some pretty controversial guests on from time to time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he still the Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: I believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn over like crazy. This is the thing I didn't realize. In science if somebody moves institutions it's a big deal. Most people don't have more than two moves in their career, maybe. But they often move to the next building is a big deal. But it in biotech-- it's like have a former colleague of mine from San Diego and he's been a CEO here, then he's a CEO there. He went back to a company he was a CEO before. He's probably back at the university we worked at for all I know. It's amazing how much moving around there. It is a very itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think they're-- in certain companies, I guess in biotech would be the case, the CEO is more of like a manager type so you can-- jumping around benefits your experience so you become better and better being a manager. There's some leader revolutionary CEOs that stick around for longer because they're so critical to pivoting a company, like the Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai is somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk is somebody like that that is part of pivoting a company into new domains constantly, but yeah. In biotech there's a machine. In the eyes of a lot of people, big pharma is like big tobacco. It's the epitome of everything that is wrong with capitalism. It's evil, right? And so I showed up in the conversation where I thought with a pretty open mind and really asked what I thought were difficult questions of him. I don't think he's ever sat down to a grilling of that kind. In fact, I'm pretty sure they cut the interview short because of that, and I thought literally it was hot in the room and we're sweating and I was asking tough questions. For somebody that half the country or a large percent of the country believes he's alleviated a lot of-- he helped, through the financial resources that Pfizer has, helped alleviate a lot of suffering in the world. And so I thought for somebody like that, I was asking pretty hard questions. Boy, did I get to hear from the side-- usually one of the sides is more intense in their anger. So there are certain political topics-- like with Andrew Tate, for example, I would hear from a very-- it would probably be the left, far left, that would write very angrily. And so that's a group you'll hear from. The Pfizer CEO, I didn't get almost any messages from people saying, why did you go so hard on him? He's an incredible human, incredible leader and CEO of a company that helped us with the vaccine that nobody thought would be possible to develop so quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You did not get letters of that sort? LEX FRIDMAN: I did not. I mean, here and there, but the sea of people that said everything from me being weak that I wasn't able to call out this person, how do you sit down, how do you platform this evil person, how do you make him look human, all that kind of stuff. And you have to deal with that. You have to-- of course, it's great. It's great because I have to do some soul searching, which is like, did I? You have to ask some hard questions. I love criticism like that. You get to-- I had some low points. There's definitely some despair and you start to wonder, was I too weak? Should I have talked to him? What is true? And you sit there alone and just marinate in that. Hopefully over time that makes you better, but I still don't know what the right answer with that one is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel that money plays a role here. When people think big pharma, they think billions of dollars-- maybe even trillions of dollars, really. And certainly people who make a lot of money get scrutiny that others don't. Part of it is that they are often not always visible, but I think that there is a natural and reflexive-- and I'm not justifying it. I certainly don't feel this because I know some people who are very wealthy, some people who are very poor. I can't say it scales with happiness at all. People are always shocked to hear that, but that's what I've observed in very wealthy people. But that people who have a lot of money are often held to a different standard because people resent that, some people resent that, and maybe there are other reasons as well. I mean, among people who are very wealthy, oftentimes the wish is for status, right? Not money. You get a bunch of billionaires in a room, and unless one of them is Elon, who also has immense status for his accomplishments, typically if you put a Nobel Prize winner in a room with a bunch of billionaires they're all talking to that person. Right? And there are many very interesting billionaires. But status is something that is often but not always associated with money, but is a much rarer form of uniqueness out there, a positive uniqueness-- if one considers status positive because there's a downside to. So I wonder whether or not the Pfizer CEO caught extra heat because people assume, and I probably assume also, that his salary is quite immense. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. So because I have a lot of data on this. I can answer it. It's a very good hypothesis. Let's test that scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to tell me it's a great hypothesis but it's wrong. I know the smirk. I know the smirk. LEX FRIDMAN: I honestly think it's wrong. That effect is there for a lot of people, but I think the distrust is not towards the CEO. The distrust is towards the company. One of the really difficult soul searching I had to do, which is just having to interact with Pfizer folks at every level, from junior to the CEO, they're all really nice people. They have a mission. They talk about trying to really help people because that's the best way to make money is to come up with medicine that helps a lot of people. The mission is clear. They're all good people, a lot of really brilliant people, PhDs. So you can have a system where all the people are good, including the CEO. And by good, I mean people that really are trying to do everything. They dedicate their whole life to do good. And yet, you have to think that that system can deviate from a path that does good because you start to deceive yourself of what is good, you turn it into a game where money does come into play from a company perspective where you convince yourself the more money you make, the more good you'll be able to do. And then you start to focus more and more and more on making more money, and then you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good. I'm not saying necessarily Pfizer does that, but I think companies could do that. You can apply that criticism to social media companies, to big pharma companies. One of the big lessons for me-- I don't know what the answer is, but that all the people inside the company can be good, people you would want to hang out with, people you would want to work with, but as a company is doing evil. That's a possibility. So the distrust I don't think is towards the billionaire individual, which I do see a lot of in this case. I think it's Wall Street distrust, that the machinery of this particular organization has gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the generalization of hate again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. And then good luck figuring out what is true. This is the tough stuff. But I should say the individuals-- individual scientists at the NIH and Pfizer are just incredible people. They're really brilliant people. I never trust the administration or the business people-- no offense, business people. But the scientists are always good. They have the right motivator in life. But again, they can have blinders on. Too focused on the science. Nazi Germany has a history of people just too focused on the science and then the politicians use the scientists to achieve whatever end they want. But if you just look narrowly at the journey of a scientist, it's a beautiful one because they're ultimately in it for the curiosity, the moment of discovery versus money. I mean, prestige probably does come into play later in life, but especially young scientists. They're after the-- it's like they're pulling at the threat of curiosity to try to discover something big. They get excited by that kind of stuff, and it's beautiful to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is beautiful see. I have a former graduate student, now a postdoc at Caltech, and I don't even know she had a cell phone. She would come in the lab, put her cell phone into the desk, and she was tremendously productive. But that wasn't why I brought it up. She was productive as a side effect of just being absolutely committed and obsessed to discover the answers to the questions she was asking as best she could, and it was-- you could feel it. You could just feel the intensity, and just incredibly low activation energy. If there was an experiment to do she would just go do it. You're teaching at MIT. You are obviously traveling the world, you're right on the podcast a lot of coverage of chess recently, which is interesting. I don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, I have some scientific questions to you about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. Let's get to those for sure. And then-- LEX FRIDMAN: You're not going to like it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. And then also some very-- do I have to spell Massachusetts again? LEX FRIDMAN: Of course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also you still seem to have a proclivity for finding guests that are controversial, right? You're thinking about Tate, we're talking about Trump, we're talking about the Pfizer CEO, we're talking about Fauci. These are intense people. And so what we're getting folks is a-- we're not doing neuroimaging here in the traditional sense of putting someone into a scanner. What we're doing here is we're using, as the great Karl Deisseroth, who was on your podcast-- LEX FRIDMAN: Thank you for that. Thank you for connecting us. He's an incredible person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, and human being and writer, and your conversation with him was phenomenal. I listened to it twice. I actually have taken notes. We talk about it in this household. We really do. His description of love is not to be missed, I'll just leave it at that, because if I try and say it I won't capture it well. But we're getting a language based map of at least a portion of Lex Fridman's brain here. So what else is going on these days in that brain as it relates to robotics, AI? Our last conversation was a lot about robots and the potential for robot-human interaction. Even what is a robot, et cetera. Are you still working on robots or focused on robots, and where is science showing up in your life besides the things we've already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: So I think the last time we talked was before Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. You were just about to leave. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's why I went on. I was like, you know, this might be the last-- you said you wanted to come out here before or after. I was like, come out there before. I want to see you before you go. But here you are in the flesh. LEX FRIDMAN: So a lot of-- just a lot of my mind has been occupied, obviously, with that part of the world. But most of the difficult struggles that I'm still going through is that I haven't launched the company that I want to launch and the company has to do with AI. I mean, it's maybe a longer conversation, but the ultimate dream is to put robots in every home. But short term I see there a possibility of launching a social media company, and it's a nontrivial explanation why that leads to robots in the home. But it's basically the algorithms that fuel effective social robotics, so robots that you can form a deep connection with. And so I've been really-- yeah, I've been building prototypes but struggling that I don't have maybe, if I were to be critical, the guts to launch a company. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or the time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, it's combined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think you've got the guts. I mean, it's clear if you'll do an interview with the Pfizer CEO and you're considering putting this Tate fellow on your podcast and you've gone to the Ukraine that you have the guts. It means not doing quite a lot of other things. LEX FRIDMAN: That's what I mean. It does take-- the thing is, as many people know, when you fill your day and you're busy, that busyness becomes an excuse that you use against doing the things that scare you. A lot of people use family in this way. You know, my wife, my kids, I can't. When in reality some of the most successful people have a wife and have kids and have families and they still do it. And so a lot of times we can fill the day with busy work, with-- yeah, of course, I have podcasts and all this kind of stuff. And they make me happy and they're all-- they're wonderful and there's research, there's teaching, and so on. But all of that can just serve as an excuse from the thing that my heart says is the right thing to do, and that's why I don't have the guts, the guts to say no to basically everything and then to focus all out. Because part of it is I'm unlikely to fail at anything in my life currently because I've already found a comfortable place. With a startup it's mostly going to be-- most likely going to be a failure, if not an embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the machine learning data that I'm aware of-- I don't know a lot about machine learning, but within the realm of neuroscience, say that a failure rate of about 15% is optimal for neuroplasticity and growth. Whether or not that translates to all kinds of practices isn't clear, but getting trials right 85% of the time seems to be optimal for language learning, seems to be optimal for mathematics, and it seems to be optimal for physical pursuits on average, right? I'm sure I'm going-- you have more machine learning geeks that listen to your podcast than listen to this podcast, but it doesn't mean you have to fail on 15% of your weight sets, folks. I mean, it could be 16%. No, I'm just kidding. It's not exact, but it's a pretty good rule of thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: I think a lot of startup founders would literally murder for 85% chance of success. I think given all the opportunities I have, the skill set, the funding, all that kind of stuff, my chances are relatively high for success. But what relatively high means in the startup world is still far, far below 85. You're talking about single digit percentages. Most startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I think it means-- the decision to focus on the company and not on other things means the decision to close the hatch on dopamine retrieval from all these other things that are very predictable sources of dopamine. Not that everything is dopamine, but dopamine is, I think, the primary chemical driver of motivation. If you know that you can get some degree of satisfaction from scrolling social media or from that particular cup of coffee, that's what you're going to do. That's what you're going to consume unless you somehow invert the algorithm and you say, it's actually my denial of myself drinking that coffee that's going to be the dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that's the beauty of having a forebrain is that you can make those decisions. This is the essence, I do believe, of what we see of David Goggins. There's much more there. There's a person that none of us know and only he knows, of course. But the idea that the pain is the source of dopamine. The limbic friction, as I sometimes like to call it, is the source of dopamine. That runs counter to how most nervous systems work, but it's decision based, right? It's not because his musculature is a certain way or he had CRISPR or something. It's because he decides that. And I think that's amazing, but what it means in terms of starting a company and changing priorities is a closing the hatch on all or many of the current sources of dopamine so that you can derive dopamine from the failures within this narrow context, and there's a very reductionist view and neurocentric view of what we're talking about. But I think about this a lot. I mean, the decision to choose one relationship versus another is a decision to close down other opportunities, right? So I think that the decision to order one thing off the menu versus others is the decision to close down those other hatches. So I think that you absolutely can do it. It's just a question of, can you flip the algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Remap the source of dopamine to something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. And maybe go out there not to succeed but make the-- the journey is the destination type thing, but when you're financially vested in your time-- and as far as I know, we only get one life, at least on this planet and you want to spend that wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of the people that surround you-- people are really important, and I don't have people around me that say you should do a start up. It's very difficult to find such people because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is Austin big startup culture right now? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it is. It is. But it doesn't make sense for me to do a startup. This is what the people that love me my whole life have been telling me, it doesn't make sense what you're doing right now. Just do the thing you were doing previously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why do I get the sense that because they are saying this you're apt to go against them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, I was never that, unfortunately. Unfortunately, I need-- I've talked to people I love, my parents, family, and so on, friends. I'm one of those people that needs unconditional support for difficult things. I know myself coaching wise is good-- so here's how I get coached best. Let's say wrestling. I like a coach that says, you want to win the Olympics? They will not-- if I say I want to win the gold medal at the Olympics in freestyle wrestling I want a coach that doesn't blink once and hears me and believes that I can do it, and then is viciously intense and cruel to me on that pursuit. If you want to do this, let's do this. Right? But that's support. That positivity, I don't-- I'm never-- I'm not energized, nor do I see that as love, a person saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, you're too old to win the Olympic gold medal, right? Or all the things you can come up with. That's not helpful to me and I can't find a dopamine, or I haven't yet, a dopamine source from the haters. Basically people that are criticizing you, trying to prove them wrong. It never got me off. It never-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas some people seem to like that. I mean, David Goggins seems to come to mind. He seems driven by many sources. He has access-- I don't know because I've never asked him, but if I were to venture a guess, I'd say that he probably has a lot of options inside his head as how to push through challenge. Not just overcome pain, but he'll post sometimes about the fact that people will say this or people will do this and talk about the pushback approach. He'll also talk about the pushback approach that's purely internal that doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. There's literally like a voice he yells that represents some kind of devil that wants him to fail, and he calls them bitch and all kinds of things saying, you know, fuck you. I'm not. There's always an enemy and he's going against that enemy. I mean, I wish-- maybe that's something. I mean, it's really interesting. Maybe you can remap it this way so that you can construct-- that's a kind of obvious mechanism. Construct an amorphous blob that is a hater that wants you to fail, right? That's kind of the David Goggins thing. And that blob says you're too weak, you're too dumb, you're too old, you're too fat, you're too whatever, and getting you to want to quit and so on. And then you start getting angry at that blob, and maybe that's a good motivator. I haven't personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I've had external challenge when I was a postdoc, very prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories, in fact, were working on the same thing that I was, and I was just this lowly postdoc working on a project pretty independent from the lab I was in. And there was competition but there was plenty of room for everybody to win, but in my head-- and frankly, I won't disclose who this is. And because there was some legitimate competition there and a little bit of friction-- not too much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, I might have pushed a few extra hours or more, a little bit. I have to say, it felt metabolizing. It felt catabolic, right? I couldn't be sustained by it. And I contrast that with the podcast or the work that my laboratory is doing now focused on stress and human performance, et cetera, and it's pure love. It's pure curiosity and love. I mean, there are hard days, but I never-- there's no adversary in the picture. They're the practical workings of life that-- LEX FRIDMAN: That was the thing that Joe really inspired me on, and people do create adversarial relationships in podcasting because you get-- YouTubers do this. They hate seeing somebody else be successful. There's a feeling of jealousy, and some people even see that as healthy. Mr. Beast is somebody, some of these popular YouTubers, how do they get 100 million views and I only get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr. Beast devoted his entire-- according to him, his entire life he's been focused on becoming this massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, he's inspiring in many ways, but there's some people that become famous for doing much less insane pursuit of greatness than Mr. Beast. People become famous and on social media and so on, and it's easy to be jealous of them. One of the early things I've learned from Joe just being a fan of his podcast is how much he celebrated everybody. And again, maybe I ruined my whole dopamine thing but I don't get energized by people that become popular. In the podcasting space and YouTube, it doesn't-- it's awesome. All of it is awesome and I'm inspired by that. But the problem is that's not a good motivator. Inspiration is like, oh, cool, humans can do this. This is beautiful. But it's not-- I'm looking. I'm looking for a forcing function. That's why I gave away the salary from MIT. I was hoping my bank account had zero. That would be a forcing function to be like, oh shit. You know? And you're not allowed to have a normal job, so I wanted to launch-- and then the podcast becomes a source of income. So it's like, goddammit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and here I have to confess my biases. You are so good at what you do in the realm of podcast-- and you're excellent at other things as well, I just have less experience in those things. I know here I'm taking the liberty of speaking for many, many people in just saying, I sure as hell hope you don't shut down the podcast. But as your friend and as somebody who cares very deeply about your happiness and your deeper satisfaction, if it's in your heart's heart to do a company, well then, damn it, do the company. LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of it I wouldn't even categorize as happiness. I don't know if you have things like that in your life, but I'm probably the happiest I could possibly be right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's wonderful. LEX FRIDMAN: But the thing is there's a longing for the start up that has nothing to do with happiness. It's something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's that itch. That's that itch. LEX FRIDMAN: I'm pretty sure I'll be less happy because it's a really tough process. I mean, to whatever degree you can extract happiness from struggle, yes, maybe. But I don't see it. I think I'll have some very, very low points. There's a lot of people who find companies-- found companies know about. And I also want to be in a relationship, I want to get married, and sure as hell a startup is not going to increase the likelihood of that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We could start up a family and start a company. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's a-- I'm a huge believer in that, which is get in a relationship at a low point in your life, which is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. I'm not disputing your stance, nor am I agreeing with it. It's just every once in a while there's a Lex Fridmanism that hits a particular circuit in my brain. I have to just laugh out loud. LEX FRIDMAN: I just think that it's easy to have a relationship when everything is good. The relationships that become strong and are tested quickly are the ones when shit is going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then there's hope for me yet. Before we sat down I was having a conversation with my podcast producer, who is a-- I wouldn't say avid, rather he's a rabid consumer of podcasts and finds these amazing podcasts, small podcasts and unique episodes. Anyway, we were talking about some stuff that he had seen and read in the business sector, and he was talking about the difference between job, career, and a calling, right? And I think he was extracting this from conversations of CEOs and founders, et cetera. I forget the specific founders that brought this to light for him. But that this idea that if you focus on a job you can make an income, and hopefully you enjoy your job or not hate it too much. A career represents a sort of, in my mind, a kind of series of evolutions that one can go through-- junior professor, tenure, et cetera. But a calling has a whole other level of energetic pull to it because it includes career and job and it includes this concept of a life. It's very hard to draw the line between a calling in career and a calling in the other parts of your life. So the question, therefore, is, do you feel a calling to start this company or is it more of a compulsion that irritates you? Is it something you wish would go away or is it something that you hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, I hope it won't go away. It's a calling. It's a calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: It's like when I see a robot-- when I first interacted with robots, and it became even stronger the more sophisticated the robots I interacted, with I see a magic there. And you're like, you look around, does anyone else see this magic? It's kind of like maybe when you fall in love, like that feeling. Does anyone else notice this person that just walked in the room? I feel that way about robots, and I can elaborate what that means but I'm not even sure I can convert it into words. I just feel like the social integration of robots in society will create a really interesting world. And our ability to anthropomorphize when we look at a robot and our ability to feel things when we look at a robot is something that most of us don't yet experience, but I think everybody will experience in the next few decades. And I just want to be a part of exploring that because it hasn't been really thoroughly explored. The best roboticists in the world are not currently working on that problem at all. They try to avoid human beings completely, and nobody's really working that problem in terms of when you look at the numbers. All the big tech companies that are investing money, the closest thing to that is Alexa and basically being a servant to help tell you the weather or play music and so on. It's not trying to form a deep connection. And so sometimes you just notice the thing. Not only do I notice the magic. There's a gut feeling, which I try not to speak to because there's no track record, but I feel like I can be good at bringing that magic out of the robot. And there's no data that says I would be good at that, but there's a feeling. It's just a feeling. Because I've done so many things-- I love doing playing guitar, all that kind of stuff, jujitsu. I've never felt that feeling. When I'm doing jujitsu I don't feel the magic of the genius required to be extremely good. At guitar I don't feel any of that. But I've noticed that in others, great musicians, they notice the magic about the thing they do and they ran with it. And I just always thought-- I think it had a different form before I knew robots existed, before I existed. The form was more about the magic between humans. I think of it as love, but the smile that two friends have towards each other when I was really young. And people would be excited when they first know each other and notice each other, and there's that moment that they share that feeling together. I was like, wow, that's really interesting. It is really interesting that these two separate intelligent organisms are able to connect all of a sudden on this deep emotional level. It's like, huh. It's just beautiful to see, and I notice the magic of that. And then when I started a programming-- programming, period, but then programming AI systems, you realize, oh, that could be-- that's not just between humans and humans. That could be humans and other entities, dogs, cats, and robots. And so I-- for some reason it hit me the most intensely when I saw robots. So yeah, it's a calling. But it's a calling that I can just enjoy the vision of it, the vision of a future world, of an exciting future world that's full of cool stuff, or I can be part of building that. And being part of building that means doing the hard work of capitalism, which is like raising funds from people, which for me, right now, is the easy part, and then hiring a lot of people. I don't know how much you know about hiring, but hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX FRIDMAN: Excellent people that will define the trajectory of not only your company, but your whole existence as a human being. And building it up, not failing them because now they all depend on you, and not failing the world with an opportunity to bring something that brings joy to people. And all of that pressure, just non-stop fires that you have to put out. The drama, the having to work with people you've never worked with like lawyers and human resources and supply chain. And because this is very compute heavy, the computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity, because you're dealing with people's data. So now you have to understand not only the cybersecurity of data and the privacy, how to maintain privacy correctly with data, but also the psychology of people trusting you with their data. And how, if you look at Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and those folks, they seem to be hated by a large number of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- I didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I always think of Jack as a loved individual, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, you have a very positive view of the world, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like Jack a lot and I like his mind and I-- someone close to him described him to me recently as he's an excellent listener. That's what they said about Jack, and that's my experience of him too. Very private person so we'll leave it at that. But listen, I think Jack Dorsey is one of the greats of the last 200 years and is just much quieter about his stance on things than a lot of people. But much of what we see in the world that's wonderful, I think we owe him a debt of gratitude. I'm just voicing my stance here, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: And the person. This is really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: A wonderful person, a brilliant person, a good person, but you still have to pay the price of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company. You don't get any extra bonus points for being a good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But his willingness to go on Rogan and deal directly and say, I don't know an answer to that in some cases. But to deal directly with some really challenging questions to me earned him tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. As an individual. He was still part of him-- you've said-- OK, and I love Jack too, and I interact with him often. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's been on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. But he's also part of a system, as we talked about, and I would argue that Jack shouldn't have brought anyone else with him on that podcast. If you go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that's right. He had a cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, he had I guess the head legal with him. And also it requires a tremendous amount of skill to go on a podcast like Joe Rogan and be able to win over the trust of people by being able to be transparent and communicate how the company really works because the more you reveal about how a social media company works, the more you open up for security, the vector of attacks increases. Also, there's a lot of difficult decisions in terms of censorship and not that are made that if you make them transparent you're going to get an order of magnitude more hate. So you have to make all those kinds of decisions, and I think that's one of the things I have to realize is you have to take that avalanche of potentially hate if you make mistakes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you have a very clear picture of this architecture of what's required in order to create a company. Of course, there's division of labor too. I mean, you don't have to do all of those things in detail, but finding people that are excellent to do-- to run the critical segments is obviously key. I'll just say what I said earlier, which is if it's in your heart's heart to start a company, if that, indeed, is your calling, and it sounds like it is, then I can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: Does the heart have a heart? I don't know. What's that expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN: We romanticize the heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In my lab at one point, early days we worked on cuttlefish, and they have multiple hearts, but they pump green blood, believe it or not. Very fascinating animal. Speaking of hearts and green blood, earlier today before we sat down I solicited four questions on Instagram in a brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: Do you want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look at some of them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, let's take these in real time. My podcast team is always teasing me that I never have any charge on my phone. I'm one of these people that likes to run in the yellow, or whatever it is. LEX FRIDMAN: An iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: It's funny how always the iPhone people are out of battery. It's weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I just got a new one. LEX FRIDMAN: So weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, this one has plenty of battery. I just got a new one so I have different numbers for different things, personal and work, et cetera. I'm trying that now. All right. Get into the-- LEX FRIDMAN: I have a chess thing too to mention to you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yes, please. Will I insult you if I look up these questions as you ask me? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no. But I will insult you by asking you this question because I think it's hilarious. So there's been a controversy about cheating where Hans Niemann, who is a 2,700 player-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused of cheating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I saw that clip on your clips channel. By the way, I love your clips channel, but I listen to your full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: The big accusation is that he cheated by having-- I mean, it's half joke but it's starting getting me to wonder whether-- so that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads so you can send messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let's rephrase that statement. Not you can, but one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank you. LEX FRIDMAN: That was a personal attack, yes. But it made me realize, I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just going to adjust myself in my seat here. LEX FRIDMAN: I use it all the time for podcasting to send myself messages to remind myself of notes. But it's interesting. I mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not going to call you again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that's exactly where I keep my phone. It did get me down this whole rabbit hole of, well, how would you be able to send communication in order to cheat in different sports? I mean, that doesn't even have to do with chess in particular, but it's interesting in chess and poker that there's mechanisms modern day where you're streaming live the competition so people can watch it on TV. If they can only send you a signal back, they-- it's just a fun little thing to think about and if it's possible to pull off. So I wanted to get your scientific evaluation of that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: To cheat using some sort of interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating of some kind. Yeah. Or no, no. That's one way to send signals is, like, Morse code, basically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So there's a famous-- I believe there's a famous real world story of physics students-- I'm going to get some of this wrong so I'm saying this in kind of coarse form so that somebody will correct this. But I believe it was physics graduate students from UC Santa Cruz or somewhere else, maybe it was Caltech-- a bunch of universities so that no one associates it with any one university that went to Vegas and used some sort of tactile device for card counting thing. This was actually demonstrated also-- not this particular incident, I don't think-- in the movie Casino where they spotted a-- I remember Robert De Niro, who you have a not so vague resemblance to, by the way, in Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, I wish I had a De Niro impression right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look it up, folks. Travis Bickle is if Lex ever shaved his head into a Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: I would. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he had a tapping device on his ankle that was signaling. Someone else was counting cards and then signaling to that person. So yeah, that could be done in the tactile way. It could be done, obviously, earpieces if it's deep earpiece. I think there are ways that they look for that. Certainly any kind of vibrational device in whatever orifice provided someone could pay attention to that while still playing the game. Yeah, I think it's entirely possible. Now, could it be done purely neurally? Could there be something that was-- and listen, it wouldn't have to even be below the skull. This is where whenever people hear about Neuralink or brain machine interface they always think, oh, you have to drill down below the skull and put a chip below into the skull. I think there are people walking around nowadays with glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- which I've used and it was very informative for me, actually, as a kind of an experiment. Gave me a lot of interesting insights about my blood sugar regulation, how it reacts to different foods, et cetera. Well, you can implant a tactile device below the skin with a simple incision. Actually, one of the neurosurgeons at Neuralink I know well because he came up at some point through my laboratory and was at Stanford, and he actually has put in a radio receiver in his hand, and his wife has it too. And he can open locks of his house and things like that, so he's been doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: Under the skin? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under the skin. You can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does that work? So how do you use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: A piercer. You go to a body piercer type person and they can just slide it under there, and it's got a battery life of something and some fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: How do you experience the tactile-- the haptics of it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. That just allows him to open certain locks with just his hand, but you could easily put some sort of tactile device in there. LEX FRIDMAN: But does it have to connect to the nerves or is it just like-- just vibration? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: And you can probably sense it even if it's under the skin, I wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it can be by-- it can be Bluetooth linked. I mean, I've seen-- there's an Engineering Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, that's got an amazing device which is about the size of a Band-Aid. It goes on the clavicles and it uses sound waves pinged into the body to measure cavitation. Think about this for a moment. This is being used in the military where, let's say, you're leading an operation or something. People are getting shot, shot at, and on a laptop you can see where the bullet entry points are. Are people dead? Are they bleeding out? Entry, exit points. You can get-- take it out of the battlefield scenario. You can get breathing, body position 24 hours a day. There's so much that you can do looking at cavitation. So these same sorts of devices on 12 hour Bluetooth could be used to send all sorts of signals. Maybe every time you're supposed to hold your hand-- I'm not a good gambler so I only play roulette when I go to Vegas because you just long, boring games, but you get some good mileage out of each out of each run, usually. But maybe every time you're supposed to hold, the person gets a stomach cinching because this is stimulating the vagus a little bit and they get a little bit of an ache. So it doesn't have to be Morse code. It can be yes, no, maybe. Right? It can be green, red, yellow type signaling. It doesn't have to be very sophisticated to give somebody a significant advantage. Anyway, I haven't thought about this in detail before this conversation but, oh, yeah, there's an immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't know if you know a poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I don't follow the gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, he's considered to be one of the greatest poker players of all time legitimately. He's just incredibly good. But he got-- there's this big case where he was accused of cheating and prove-- and it's not really cheating, which is what's really fascinating. Is it turns out-- so he plays poker. Texas Hold'em, mostly, but all kinds of poker. It turns out that the grid on the back of the cards is often printed a little bit imperfectly, and so you can use the asymmetry of the imperfections to try to figure out certain cards. So if you play and you remember that a certain card is, like-- I think the 8 in that deck that he was accused of-- an 8 and 9 were slightly different symmetry wise. So he can now ask the dealer actually to rotate it to check the symmetry. So you would ask the dealer to rotate the card to see that there's-- to detect the asymmetry of the back of the card, and now he knows which cards are 8's and 9's or likelier to be 8's and 9's, and he was using that information to play poker and win a lot of money. But it's just a slight advantage. And his case is-- and in fact, the judge found this, that he's not actually cheating, but it's not right. You can't use this kind of extra information. So it's fascinating that you can discover these little holes in games if you pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It's fascinating. And I think that I did watch that clip about the potential of a cheating event in chess, and the fact that a number of chess players admit to cheating at some point in their career. Very, very interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, it was online. So online cheating is easier, right? When you're playing online cheating in a game where the machine is much better than the human, it's very difficult to prove that you're human. And that applies, by the way, another really big thing is in social media, the bots. If you're running a social media company you have to deal with the bots and they become-- one of the really exciting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence, to me, is the very fast improvement of language models. So neural networks that generate text, that interpret text, that generate from text, images and all that kind of stuff. But you're now going to create incredible bots that look awfully a lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, at least they're not going to be those crypto bots that seem to populate my comment section when I post anything on Instagram. I actually delete those even though they add to the comment roster and if-- they bother me so much. I spend at least 10, 15 minutes on each post just deleting those. I don't know what they need to do but I'm not interested in those, whatever it is they're offering. Speaking of nonbots, I'm going to assume that all the questions are not from bots. There are a lot of questions here-- more than 10,000 questions. Goodness. I'll just take a few, working from top to bottom. What ideas have you been wrestling with lately? And I think about the company as one, but as I scroll to the next, what are some others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, some of the things we've talked about, which is the ideas of how to understand what is true, what is true about a human being, how to reveal that, how to reveal that through conversation, how to challenge that properly, that it leads to understanding not derision. So that applies to everybody from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin. Also another idea is there's a deep distrust of science in trying to understand-- the growing distrust of science, trying to understand what's the role of those of us that have a foot in the scientific community, how to regain some of that trust. Also, there's-- as we talked about, how to find and how to-- yeah, how to find and how to maintain a good relationship. I mean, that's really been-- I've never felt quite as lonely as I have this year with Ukraine. It's just like, so many times I would just lay there and just feeling so deeply alone because I felt that my home-- not my home literally because I'm an American. I'm a proud American. I'll die an American. But my home in the sense of generationally, my family's home, is now going-- has been changed forever. There's no more being proud of being from the former Russia or Ukraine. It's now a political message to say-- to show your pride, and so it's been extremely lonely. And within that world, with all the things I'm pursuing, how do you find a successful relationship? It has been tough. But obviously-- and there's a huge number of technical ideas with the startup of, like, how the hell do you make this thing work? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the relationship topic is one we talked a little bit about, and last time we touched on in a little bit more detail. We're going to come back to that, so I've made a note here. What or who inspired Lex, you, to wear a suit every time you podcast? That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two answers to that question. One is a suit and two is a black suit and black tie because I used to do-- I used to have more variety, which is like it was always a black suit but I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie. But that was mostly me trying to fit in to society because varieties-- you're supposed to have some variety. What inspired me at first was a general culture that doesn't take itself seriously in terms of how you present yourself to the world. So in academia, in the tech world, at Google, everybody was wearing pajamas and very relaxed. In the tech. I don't know how it is in the science, in the chemistry, biology, and so on. But in computer science everybody was very-- I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear so I wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment seriously and everything I do seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks, but it made me feel that way. And I think, in terms of people I look up to that wore a suit that made me think of that is probably Richard Feynman. I see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was a wonderful human being. LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the epitome of class and humor and brilliance, and obviously I could never come close to that kind of-- be able to simply explain really complicated ideas and to have humor and wit, but definitely aspire to that. And then there's just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s, the classiness of that. There's something about a suit that both removes the importance of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit allows people to focus on your character and then do so with the full responsibility of that, this is who I am. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, and I love what you said just prior to that. My father, who, again, is always asking me why I don't dress formally like you do always said to me growing up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know that you took them seriously. So it's a sign of respect for your audience too in my eyes. Someone asked, is there an AI equivalent of psychedelics? And I'm assuming they mean is there something that machines can do for themselves in order to alter their neural circuitry through unconventional activation patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, I don't know exactly how psychedelics work, but you can see that with all the diffusion models now with Dali and the stable diffusion that generates from text, art. It's basically a small injection of noise into a system that has a deep representation of visual information. So it is able to convert text to art in introducing uncertainty into that noise into that. That's kind of maybe. I could see that as a parallel to psychedelics, and it's able to create some incredible things. From a conceptual understanding of a thing, it can create incredible art that no human, I think, could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness. Randomness does a lot of work in the machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are a lot of requests of you for relationship, a lot of requests about statistics about you, data about you specifically. Flipping past those, what was the hardest belt to achieve in jujitsu? I would have assumed the black belt, but is that actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. I mean, everybody has a different journey through jujitsu, as people know. For me, the black belt was the ceremonial belt, which is not usually the case, because I fought the wars. I trained twice a day for I don't know how many years-- seven, eight years. I competed nonstop. I competed against people much better than me. I competed against many and beaten many black belts and brown belts. I think, for me personally, the hardest belt was the brown belt because, for people who know jujitsu, the size of tournament divisions for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous. Like Worlds, when I competed at Worlds it was, like, 140 people in a division, which means you have to win-- I forget how many times, but seven, eight, nine times in a row to medal. And so I just had to put in a lot of work during that time. And especially for competitors, instructors usually really make you earn a belt. So to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. And then to earn the brown belt means I had to compete nonstop against other purple belts, which are young. You're talking about-- the people that usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds that are shredded, incredible cardio. They can, for some reason, are in their life where they can-- no kids, nothing. They can dedicate everything to this pursuit so they're training two, three, four times a day. Diet is on point. You're going-- and for me, because they're usually bigger and taller than me and just more aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah, I had to go through a lot of wars to earn that brown belt. But then-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got to try this jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should. But it's a different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I tried it. I did the one class, but I really want to embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: As you know, many pursuits like jujitsu are different if you're doing it in your 20s and 30s and later. It's like it's a different-- you're not-- you can have a bit of an ego in your 20s. You can have that fire under you, but you should be more zenlike and wise and patient later in life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one would hope. That's the wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: I think Rogan is still a meathead. He still goes hard and crazy and he's still super competitive on that, so some people can-- Jocko is somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever they're doing they're doing something right because they're still in it, and that's super impressive. There were far too many questions to ask all of them, but several, if not many, asked a highly appropriate question for where we are in the arc of this discussion. And this is one, admittedly, that you ask in your podcast all the time, but I get the great pleasure of being in the question asker seat today. And so, what is your advice to young people? LEX FRIDMAN: So I just gave a lecture at MIT and the amount of love I got there is incredible. And so of course, who you're talking to is usually undergrads, maybe young graduate students, and so there one person did ask for advice as a question at the end. I did a bunch of Q&A. So my answer was that the world will tell you to find a work-life balance, to explore, to try to-- try different fields to see what you really connect with, variety, general education, all that kind of stuff. And I said in your 20s I think you should find one thing you're passionate about and work harder at that than you worked at anything else in your life. And if it destroys you, it destroys you. That's advice for in your 20s. I don't know how universally true that advice is, but I think at least give that a chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards a thing you really care about, and work your ass off. That said, I've met so many people, and I'm starting to think that advice is best applied or best tried in the engineer disciplines, especially programming. I think there's a bunch of disciplines in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours, and it's much more important to actually have a clarity of thinking and great ideas and have an energetic mind. The grind in certain disciplines does not produce great work. I just know that in computer science and programming it often does. Some of the best people ever that have built systems, have programmed systems are usually like the John Carmack kind of people that drink soda, eat pizza, and program 18 hours a day. So I don't know actually. You have to, I think, really go discipline specific. So my advice applies to my own life which has been mostly spent behind that computer, and for that you really, really have to put in the hours. And what that means is essentially it feels like a grind. I do recommend that you should at least try it in your own. That if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever, I think if they're honest with you they're going to talk about their 20s as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really hard work. I think what really happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful people later in life will talk about work-life balance. They'll say, you know what I learned from that process is that it's really important to get, like, sun in the morning, to have health, to have good relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef. Exactly. But I think you have forgot-- those people have forgotten the value of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work-life balance is best learned the hard way. My own perspective. There are certain things you can only learn the hard way, and so you should learn that the hard way. Yeah, so that's definitely advice. And I should say that I admire people that work hard. If you want to get on my good side, I think there are the people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually matter what it is, but towards achieving excellence in a thing. That's the highest thing that we can reach for as human beings I think is excellence at a thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Well, speaking of excellent at a thing. Whether or not it's teaching at MIT or the podcast or the company that resides in the near future that you create-- once again, I'm speaking for an enormous number of people that excellence and hard work, certainly, are woven through everything that you do. Every time I sit down with you I begin and finish with such an immense feeling of joy and appreciation and gratitude, and it wouldn't be a Lex Fridman podcast, or in case of Lex even being a guest on a podcast, if the word love weren't mentioned at least 10 times. So the feelings of gratitude for all the work you do, for taking the time here today to share with us what you're doing, your thoughts, your insights, what you're perplexed about and what drives you and your callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can I read a poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please. He was trying to cut me off post. That was getting a little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no, no. I was thinking about this recently. It's one of my favorite Robert Frost poems, and I-- because I wrote several essays on it, as you do, because I think it's a popular one that's read. Essays being, like, trying to interpret poetry, and it's one that sticks with me. I mean, both its calm beauty, but in the seriousness of what it means because I ultimately think it's the-- so "Stopping by a Woods on a Snowy Evening." I think it's ultimately a human being, a man, asking the old Sisyphus, the old Camus question of, why live? I think this poem, even though it doesn't seem like it is a question of a man contending with suicide and choosing to live. Whose woods these are, I think I know. His house is in the village, though. He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest evening of the year. He gives this harness bells a shake to ask if there's some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep. The woods representing the darkness, the comfort of the woods representing death, and he's a man choosing to live. Yeah, I think about that often, especially my darker moments is you have promises to keep. Thank you for having me, Andrew. You're a beautiful human being. I love you, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love you, brother. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Lex Fridman, and special thanks to Dr. Lex Fridman for inspiring me to start this podcast.

Title: Dr. Chris Palmer: Diet & Nutrition for Mental Health
Published: 2022-11-21 13:00:42 UTC
Description:
My guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Chris Palmer. Dr. Chris Palmer is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He is the world expert in the relationship between metabolic disorders and psychiatric disorders. He treats a variety of different conditions, including psychosis, including schizophrenia, as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression among others. He is best known for understanding the relationship between how metabolism and these various disorders of the mind interact. And indeed, today, he describes not only his own fascinating journey into the field of psychiatry but also his clinical and research experience using diet that is different forms of nutrition in order to treat various psychiatric disorders. He describes some remarkable case studies of individuals and groups of people who have achieved tremendous relief from the types of psychiatric disorders that I just mentioned a few moments ago, as well as new and emerging themes as to how metabolism and the mind interact to control things like obesity. Indeed, he raises the hypothesis that perhaps obesity, in many cases, is the consequence of a brain dysfunction as opposed to the consequence of a metabolic dysfunction that then impacts the brain. During today's episode, he shares with us his overriding hypotheses about the critical roles that mitochondrial function and dysfunction play in mental health and mental illness, and how various particular types of diets-- ranging from the ketogenic diet to modified ketogenic diet and even just slight adjustments in carbohydrate intake-- can be used in order to change mitochondrial function and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses. He also highlights the essential and important theme that various diet interventions, including the ketogenic diet, were not first developed for sake of weight loss but rather were developed as treatments for neurologic conditions, such as epilepsy. Today, he shares with us how the foods that we eat alone and in combination, and how fasting-- both intermittent fasting and more lengthy fasts-- can interact with the way that our brain functions to strongly control the way that we think, feel, and behave. What's wonderful is that Dr. Palmer not only explains the science and his clinical expertise, but also points to various actionable measures that people can take in order to improve their mental health. I'd like to mention that Dr. Palmer is also the author of a terrific new book. The title is Brain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD and More. I've read the book, and it is a terrific read. I came away from this book with a much evolved understanding of how the various psychiatric disorders that I just described, as well as ADHD, emerge in people. And it has completely revised my understanding about the possible origins of various psychiatric disorders and the best ways to treat them, including both with medications but also with nutritional approaches. If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Palmer's work and the book, please go to chrispalmermd.com. We also provide links to the book and to his website in our show note captions. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools for the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the word "nootropics" because it means smart drugs. And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits in the brain or body for being, quote unquote, "smart." Thesis understands this. And they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and body into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish. They use the highest quality ingredients, things like phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC, many ingredients that I've talked about before on this podcast and that I happen to use myself. I've been using Thesis for over a year now. And I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a game changer. For me, I like their nootropic for clarity. I use that before cognitive work often. And I like their nootropic for energy, and I often use that before workouts-- in particular, workouts that are especially intense. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman. Take their 3-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month. Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman. And use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off your first box. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we wake up in the morning, that is, in large part, because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now, people have different core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleeping, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their sleep fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford. And everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system. And I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly-- for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or often to the distance. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling. And indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time I can't even remember that they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, they also have a terrific aesthetic. And they can be used just as well for wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA-- that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's ROKA, roka.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. And now, for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer. Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank you for being here. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, for having me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a lot of questions for you. And I'm really excited about this topic because I think most people know what mental illness is-- or they have some idea what that is. Most people have some idea what nutrition is. Fewer people certainly know how closely those things can interact. And I think everybody is familiar with the feeling of a food or the ingestion of a food making them feel good in the short term. When we eat a food that tastes delicious to us or that we associate with something nice, then we feel good mentally and physically. Whereas, when we eat something that gives us food poisoning or maybe even something that just doesn't taste that great or that we associate with a bad experience, we feel less good in the short term. But I believe that very few people understand or are familiar with the fact that nutrition and our mental health interact in this very intimate, maybe even causal, way and that is something that occurs over long periods of time. Meaning, what I ate yesterday or the day before, maybe even 10 years ago, could be impacting the way that my brain and body are making me feel now. So if you would, I'd love for you to just tell us about a little bit of the history, in particular, your history with exploring the relationship between nutrition and mental health. And then we can dive into some of the more particulars of ketogenic diets versus other diets, and some of the truly miraculous findings that you and others are coming up with based on real patients and real experiences of people who suffer and then find relief by altering their nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. This story really starts with my own personal story. And I don't need to go into great detail. But to set the stage, when I was a kid, I definitely had mental illness, started with OCD. A series of events happened in my family. My mother had a horrible kind of psychotic break, and all sorts of adverse childhood events for me. She and I were actually homeless together for a while. I went on to have subsequent depression, suicidality, all sorts of things. But somehow or another, I pulled myself together and got through medical school-- actually did quite well in medical school, got an award for being one of the top students, and then was doing my internship and residency at Harvard. And at that point in time, I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. So I had high blood pressure, horrible lipids, and pre-diabetes. And I was doing everything right supposedly. I was on a low-fat diet, and I was exercising regularly. And year after year, my doctor kept telling me diet and exercise. I kept asking him, what diet? What exercise? I was doing everything he kept telling me to do. Everything was getting worse. My blood pressure kept going higher. And at some point, he kind of said, you're going to have to go on medication. I need to put you on something for your pre-diabetes, something for your cholesterol, and something for your blood pressure. So three pills out of the gate. And I'm like, I'm only in my 20s. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Were you overweight? CHRIS PALMER: No. Technically, no. I had a gut, so that's a sign of insulin resistance, I know now. I didn't know it then. And he actually kind of leaned in at one point and said, do your parents have diabetes? Yeah. Do your parents have high blood pressure? Yeah. Are your parents overweight? Yeah. Oh, I'm really sorry, it's genetic. Basically, you're screwed. It's your genes. You're just going to have to bite the bullet and take meds. And as a physician, I knew what that meant. I knew that I'm in my 20s, if I'm already on three meds for metabolic syndrome, I'm going to be screwed by the time I'm 40 or 50. And I'm probably going to be having heart attacks. And I'd heard through the rumor mill that the Atkins diet could somehow help people improve their cholesterol in pre-diabetes. I actually didn't really believe it. I was highly skeptical. And I believed everything I was taught in medical school. Why would my professors lie to me? They knew what they were talking about. Low-fat diet was the thing to do. And the Atkins diet was clearly dangerous and reckless. But I had been trying the medical dogma for years, and it wasn't working for me. And so for whatever reason, I decided this is going to be my last attempt at something different. And then I'll just bite the bullet and go on meds. So I tried the Atkins diet. I did my own special version of it. I still avoided red meat because I was terrified of red meat. I tried to do a healthy version, which it's probably more like the South Beach diet. This was before the South Beach Diet was invented. But within three months, my metabolic syndrome was completely gone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized. Did your weight change? You mentioned that you were of healthy weight but that you had a bit of abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS PALMER: I lost the abdominal fat. I probably lost about 10 pounds through this process. But everything got normal. And when I went back to my doctor, he was shocked. He actually said, what the hell are you doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: During the time before you switched to this new diet, how was your mental health, if you don't mind me asking? Because it sound like you're very clear that there was metabolic syndrome or you were headed towards more severe metabolic syndrome. You mentioned OCD. I actually am familiar with this. As a kid, I had a low level kind of Tourette's grunt. And probably me, obsessive still to some extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed OCD, so I can relate somewhat. If you're willing, what was the context of all that before and after this nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: So before the nutritional switch, I was still struggling with low grade depression and OCD. Again, it wasn't necessarily interfering with my ability to function because I was functioning at a high level. Anybody looking from the outside, you're a top student. You just got into one of the most competitive-- actually, at that point, it was the most competitive residency program in the country for psychiatry. So they would have looked at me and said, you're fine. But I wasn't. I was actually on medications. I was trying different medications, trying to figure out how to feel better, how to stop obsessing so much, how to not be so depressed. And I found that those medications, they actually came with more side effects for me than benefits. I was on Prozac for a long time. It totally messed up my sleep. And then the psychiatrist was like, you need pills to help you sleep now. And I'm-- I just-- I'm like, that doesn't-- that's not really resonating very well with me. And I'm now a psychiatrist. I'm in my psychiatry residency. And I'm thinking, you know what? That's just not sitting well with me that you're going to prescribe more and more meds for all the side effects that you're causing. And yet at the same time, I wanted to feel better. And I was learning chemical imbalances. This is what we do to get rid of depression and OCD. You're supposed to take your pills. And so I was taking my pills. I was in psychotherapy. I had been in psychotherapy on and off for years. I had received much more intensive treatment when I was younger. And that was essentially worthless for me. It actually probably just caused harm at the end of the day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per se, but some of them were psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. I was actually hospitalized at one point. I had been put on lithium and imipramine, which is a tricyclic antidepressant, and other things. And they were actually horrible. They were horrible. They did nothing beneficial for me. I gave them a decent amount of time to work. I really wanted to feel better. So at the time that I tried this diet, I certainly wasn't impaired in the same way. I wasn't struggling that much. But I was-- still have these low grade symptoms, was trying to feel better. And the thing that was the most striking to me, after doing the diet for three months, was not the fact that my metabolic syndrome was gone. That was my goal, and it was a seemingly miraculous achievement because I got rid of everything with one dietary change. But the thing that I noticed was dramatic improvement in my mood, energy, concentration, and sleep. I-- for the first time in my life, I started waking up before my alarm went off and feeling rested. That never happened to me before. I was meticulous about planning when my alarm went off and how many times I could push the snooze button in order to be on time for wherever I needed to be, whether it was school or the hospital or whatever. I had it. I had this good system. I was never late for anything. But that was shocking to me, that I felt so good. And one of the things that I've often said to people, prior to the diet, I always felt like there are two types of people in the world. There are "haves" and "have-nots." There are these happy, peppy people, who just are so positive, and they've got energy. And they have the saying, they like to work hard and play hard. And I always understood working hard. I totally got that because I was a hard worker and I understood the value of hard work. And you got to do something useful with yourself. But I never understood who the hell wants to play hard, like who's got energy for that? Aren't you tired from working so hard? How on Earth do these people have energy to go and play hard? And I assumed that they were just part of the "haves" in the world. And they were just lucky and privileged. They either had good genetics or maybe they had good childhoods or good parents or something-- something that I didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The kids with genuine smiles in the yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas, the rest-- and by the way, I really appreciate you sharing some of your personal story because I think it is very important for people to hear and understand that people like yourself, who are extremely high functioning and accomplished, that the road was-- from everything I'm hearing and understanding-- very choppy internally at times, and that you've overcome a lot in order to get there. And also, have been going through what sounds like a very long iterative process of trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work to finally arrive at a solution, and then make that the basis of much of the work that you're doing today for other people. I think it's very important because I think many people share with you this notion that there are indeed two groups-- a happy group and then fated-to-be unhappy group. And it speaks to the fact that-- your story, rather, speaks to the fact that what we see is not always what's going on internally with people and that this notion of there just being two groups-- the happy or the haves and the have-nots-- can't be the way that it works, and there are probably many more people suffering than we realize, and that there is an important need for tools to overcome that suffering. So I really just hear you. Even early in our discussion, I just want to extend a genuine thanks because so much of what I hear from people is questions about health, and mental health, and physical health. But that clearly point to the fact that many people are struggling to varying degrees. And even the people who are in this category of great childhood and happiness could do far better for themselves and then also for other people. So thank you for that. I want to know. At the point where you realized that nutrition can play a profound role in how you feel and operate in a large number of domains, you are still a student or a resident at that point? CHRIS PALMER: I was a resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: At that point, did you decide that you were going to explore this in a professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So what was the journey forward into the work that you're doing now? CHRIS PALMER: So the next step was that I just had friends and family who saw me, saw that I had improved my health, saw that I lost some weight pretty easily. In particular, I remember my sister and sister-in-law, they got really pissed at me one Thanksgiving because I could resist all the pumpkin pie, and apple pie, and everything else. They were like, how the hell are you doing that? How are you resisting all of this food? And I said, I don't crave it anymore. I don't want it, I'm fine. I'm just-- I'm having turkey and green beans. And that's good enough for me. So I got them to do the diet. And they too noticed dramatic improvement in their moods, and energy, and sleep, and everything else. So within a few years, the primary thing I noticed is this powerful antidepressant effect. And now, I'm an attending physician. I've got all these patients in my clinical practice with treatment resistant mental illness. I'm in a tertiary care hospital. So I almost never get somebody off the street with their first episode of depression. Out of the gate, as part of my career, I get treatment resistant mental disorders. So I get people who've already been to 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. They've usually tried dozens of different medications. They've been in decades of psychotherapy. They've often had ECT and other things. And nothing's working. And I'm thinking, well, we're kind of out of options for these other people. And this diet is having this really powerful antidepressant effect. I think I'm going to try it and just see if any of my patients are game to try it to see if it might help them. Sure enough, it did. Didn't help everyone and not everybody was interested and/or able to do it. But some of the ones who were able to do it ended up having a remarkable and powerful antidepressant effect. One woman actually became hypomanic within a month. And she had been depressed pretty much nonstop for over five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, in and out of hospitals. And I saw her become hypomanic. And I'm thinking, wow, this really is a powerful antidepressant effect. This is amazing. This is like a medication but better because it actually is working for her. But I laid low at that point because, at that point, we didn't have many clinical trials of the safety or efficacy of the Atkins diet for even weight loss or diabetes, let alone any mental disorders. And so I really actually felt like I'm on the fringe here. And this is not going to be met with praise by anyone. So I'm just going to lay low. I'm going to offer it to patients. And I went along that way up until 2016. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And may I just ask about the diet? When you say "Atkins diet," so this is low to zero starch, so low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And was it traditional Atkins? Were you tailoring it to the individual patient depending on their psychiatric symptoms, whether or not they were overweight or not overweight? I'm assuming you're not a nutritionist, so how did you prescribe a nutrition plan for your patients? And what was involved in making sure that they adhered to that, maybe even some of the things you observed in terms of who was more willing to try this or not try this? Any observations or maybe even data? CHRIS PALMER: So early on, I was winging it. And I was-- the first few patients, it was try this Atkins diet. I want to see ketosis, so I was going for ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they were pricking their finger, and they were doing a blood ketone test? CHRIS PALMER: I didn't know about blood ketone monitors if they existed back then. So I was-- we were using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which are not quite as accurate but still useful as a general guide, from what I understand. CHRIS PALMER: True. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly recommending that patients achieve urinary ketosis. And the interesting thing is I noticed a pattern, that when they were trying the diet and not getting ketones, they often did not get a clinical benefit. It was once they got into ketosis that I began to notice the clinical benefit and the powerful antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably any nutrition plan, a.k.a diet, that elevated ketones in the urine to the point where you would say, this person is in ketosis-- or they would say I'm in ketosis-- that was a step in the right direction, independent of exactly what they were eating or not eating to get there, including fasting? At that time, probably, fasting wasn't as popular now. Thanks to the incredible work-- I think it's incredible, and he is a former colleague. And I know there's a lot of controversy about fasting. But I think, for many people, fasting is a powerful tool. For others, it's a less useful tool --of Satchin Panda and others. But fasting certainly will limit your carbohydrate intake and get you into ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: It will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you have any patients fast or do intermittent fasting? CHRIS PALMER: I did. I had some patients who did what Atkins had called a fat fast, where they eat primarily fat. So they either fast and/or they eat primarily fats to try to get into a state of ketosis. So for some patients, it was actually quite easy to get into ketosis, especially overweight and obese patients. They have a lot of fat stores on their body and actually limiting carbohydrates usually results in high levels of ketosis for them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And they probably feel better too, I imagine, because when we limit our starch intake, we start to excrete a lot of water. People can get some pretty quick weight loss that even though it may not be fat loss, makes them feel literally a little lighter and maybe a little more energetic. Is that right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. And as the years went on, the field was advancing, more research was coming out. People were getting a little more sophisticated with blood ketone monitoring, with different versions of ketogenic diets. And I was evolving my practice. The thing that completely upended everything that I knew as a psychiatrist, though, was when I helped a patient in 2016 lose weight. So this was a patient, 33-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder. He had been my patient for eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you clarify for people what schizoaffective disorder is? I'm not a clinician. But as I recall, it's like a low level of schizophrenia. So there might be some auditory hallucinations. If I met this person, I might think they're kind of different, quote unquote, "weird." But they would not seem necessarily scary to me and to typically to other people. And I mean that with respect, of course. But oftentimes, people with schizophrenia can seem just like-- you don't even know how to interact with them because their world seems so altered because they have all these so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations, and they're talking to people that no one else can see, et cetera. Is that schizoaffective? CHRIS PALMER: So no. So schizoaffective is the same as schizophrenia essentially. The only difference is it's schizophrenia with superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so it's actually more severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: It can be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So I have it backwards. CHRIS PALMER: So schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia and plus some mood episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe I'm thinking of schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER: Schizotypal is the low grade, kind of mild paranoia, or kind of eccentric beliefs, and other things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks out there, I have my nomenclature backwards. Schizotypal is the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia or schizoid-like. Schizoaffective is as or more severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And now, it's absolutely clear who the clinician in the room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank you for that reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. So this man had schizoaffective disorder. He had daily auditory hallucinations. He had paranoid delusions. He could not go out in public without being terrified. He was convinced that there were these powerful families, that they had technologies that could control his thoughts. They could broadcast his thoughts to other people. They were trying to hurt him. They had targeted him for some reason. He wasn't quite sure why. He had some suspicions and beliefs about maybe when he did this bad thing when he was 11 years old, that's why they decided to target him. This man was tormented by his illness, tormented. It ruined his life. He had already tried 17 different medications, and none of them stopped his symptoms. But they did cause him to gain a lot of weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These medications, as I recall, for schizophrenia-- the classical ones are dopamine receptor blockers-- caused people to-- huge increases in prolactin. That's why sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. And they'll put on a lot of weight. And they'll be catatonic-- or movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They make you feel like-- I have to imagine, given how good most things that release dopamine make us feel, that blocking dopamine receptors with antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. And it's a huge challenge in our field because a lot of patients don't want to take them. And then you get these rebound effects. If patients are on them for several months, and then they stop them cold turkey, they can get wildly psychotic and ill, end up aggressive or hospitalized or sometimes dead. So that's him. He weighs 340 pounds. And for whatever reason, he gets it in his head, I'm never going to get a girlfriend if I don't lose some weight. He also recognizes, I'm never going to get a girlfriend because I'm a loser. I'm schizophrenic. I live with my father. I have nothing going for me. But I could at least try to address one of these awful, horrible things about myself. And maybe I could lose some weight. So he asked for my help. For a variety of reasons, we ended up deciding to try the ketogenic diet. Now, at this point, I have no anticipation that the ketogenic diet is going to do anything for his psychiatric symptoms because this man has schizoaffective disorder. That's not depression. Depression is very different. They're totally different disorders. So he decides to give it a try. Within two weeks, not only does he start losing weight, but I begin to notice this dramatic antidepressant effect. He's making better eye contact. He's smiling more. He's talking a lot more. I'm thinking like, what's gotten into you? You're coming to life. Like you're-- I've never heard you talk this much. I've never seen you so excited or present or alive. I haven't changed his meds at all. The thing that upended everything that I knew as a psychiatrist was six to eight weeks in, he spontaneously starts reporting, you know, those voices that I hear all the time? They're going away. And he says, you know how I always thought that there were all these families who were controlling my thoughts and out to get me, and they had targeted me? And I'm thinking, oh, yeah. We've been talking about that for eight years. We can talk about that again. He says, you know what? Now that I think about it, I don't think that's true. And now that I say it, it sounds kind of crazy. It probably never was. I've probably had schizophrenia all along like everybody's been trying to tell me. And I think it's going away. That man went on-- he's now lost 160 pounds and kept it off to this day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: He was able to do things he had not been able to do since the time of his diagnosis. He was able to complete a certificate program. He's able to go out in public and not be paranoid. He performed improv in front of a live audience. at? One point, he was able to move out of his father's home and live independently. And that completely blew my mind as a psychiatrist. And I went on a scientific journey to understand what in the hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That is indeed mind-blowing. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3/K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3/K2. I have a couple of questions. First of all, did he stay on any kind of antipsychotic or other medication? If so, were the dosages adjusted, excuse me, while undergoing this remarkable transition? Because as we know, it's not an either or medication or nutrition changes, it can be both. And then the other question is one of adherence. I think about someone with schizoaffective disorder, who's suffering from all the sorts of things that you described. How does somebody like that organize themselves in order to stay on a ketogenic diet? And I say this with all the seriousness in the world. I think there are a lot of people who do not have schizotypal or schizoaffective disorder who have trouble, they claim, adhering to a ketogenic diet. It's not the easiest diet. Certainly in its extreme form at first, it's not the easiest diet to stick to. So how did he do it? That sounds like a remarkable individual. And I'd also like to just know your general thoughts about adherence to things when people are back on their heels mentally. How do they get motivated and stick to something? So the questions were, medication, yes or no? If yes, dosage adjusted, yes or no. And if people are suffering from depression or full-blown psychotic episodes, how does one ensure that they continue to adhere to a diet? CHRIS PALMER: So in terms of medications, he has remained on medication. So early on, I wasn't adjusting anything. I was just in disbelief and shock that this was happening. I didn't know what was going on. Over the years, we have slowly but surely tried to taper him off his meds. He has been on meds for decades. He started medications when he was a young child. His brain is as developed in response to all sorts of psychiatric medications. And it has not been easy to try to get him off. We continue to try to get him off medication. And it's challenging and difficult. And I just want to say for any listeners, it is-- getting off your meds is very difficult and dangerous. And you need to do it with supervision, with a mental health professional or a prescriber because it is dangerous. When people reduce their meds too much, they can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that true for depression as well? CHRIS PALMER: It's true for any psychiatric medication. The brain makes adaptations in response to psychiatric medications. And when you stop them cold turkey-- some people are fine. But I wouldn't recommend finding out because I've seen patients-- when they stop antidepressants, I've seen patients get flooredly depressed and suicidal within three months. I had one patient, almost quit her job because she became convinced that, well, my life sucks, and it's all because of my boss. And I know that she's just a horrible human being. And she's abusing me. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I think this is related to your medication change. We got her back on her meds, within three days, she said, oh my god, I can't believe that happened. I almost quit my job. And that would have been the most illogical and irrational decision I've ever made in my entire life. But somehow, it seemed so real just several days ago. And now that I'm back on this medication-- and it doesn't mean that she needs the meds. But it doesn't mean that he needs the meds. It means that meds need to be adjusted very safely, and cautiously, and gradually. So that's the medication piece. The adherence piece was not easy for him and for other patients. It is very rare that I have a patient who I can say, do the ketogenic diet. Come see me in 3 months, and let me know how it was going. That almost never happens. It has happened, I think, on two occasions. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that is, if I understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you-- but many psychiatrists do with medication. It's, here's your prescription. Let's talk in-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month or three months. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a variable that is probably worth us exploring a little bit here as the conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That frequent contact and making micro adjustments or macro adjustments to medication or nutrition, could be meaningful. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. So with this particular patient, early on, he was actually pretty adherent. I was seeing him once a week. And so I could do a lot of education. I was weighing him. I was checking his ketones. I was checking his glucose levels. At that point, I had a blood ketone monitor in my office. So I knew whether he was compliant or not, which is so beneficial in doing clinical work and research on this diet. It's the only diet where within seconds, I can have an objective biomarker of compliance or noncompliance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such a key point and again, brings to mind, for me, the parallel with medication. A patient can say they're taking their medication, and unless they're in a hospital setting, where somebody's checking under their tongue and all of this, they very well could not be taking it or taking more. And you and I both know that blood draws for neurotransmitter levels are complicated because you want to know what's in the brain and what's functional in the brain. And then we have to imagine that most people there prescribed drugs for any number of different psychiatric conditions are not giving blood every time they talk to their psychiatrist or psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No. On that front, when we've looked at studies of compliance, the majority of patients are at least somewhat noncompliant with prescription medications. It's not on purpose. They forgot. They take it at night. They were out late. They were off their routine. They forgot to brush their teeth-- because that's when they take their meds. And so because it was so late, they just crashed when they got home. They forgot to take their meds. Happens all the time. If it's a medication that people take more than once a day, the noncompliance rates are much higher because it's just easy to forget. So it's not that people are willfully disobeying their doctors or anything else. It's just hard to remember to take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you say measuring ketones, I want to drill into this a little bit because it does seem that the presence of ketones and somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," it turns out to be the key variable. Certainly, in your book, that's one of the major takeaways-- although there were many important takeaways-- that people get into ketosis. Do they have to stay in ketosis? So for instance, I've followed the-- I don't any longer. But I've tried, in the past, the so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, where every third or fourth day, get some pasta, or rice, et cetera. That was interesting as an experiment. But to stay in ketosis, what sort of blood levels of ketones do you like to see in your patients? What is the range that you think most people could aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: So it really depends on the patient and what I'm treating, quite honestly. And I don't think every patient needs the ketogenic diet. For some patients, simply getting rid of junk food can make a huge difference in a mood disorder, for instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food that could last on the shelf a very long time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods that are usually high in both sugar, carbohydrate, and carbs, and fats. Those seem to be the worst foods. That combination-- high sugar, high fat-- seems to be the worst combination for metabolic health. And lo and behold, we've got emerging data that suggests, that strongly suggests, it's also bad for mental health. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders. And so we have the best data for those disorders. But we actually have a lot of data with even bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that insulin resistance, in particular, and insulin signaling in the brain is impaired in people with chronic mental disorders kind of across the board-- all the way from chronic anxiety, depression, to bipolar, to schizophrenia, and even Alzheimer's disease. We know that patients with all of those disorders have impaired glucose metabolism and that the insulin signaling system in the brain, which is different than insulin signaling in the periphery, seems to somehow possibly be playing a role. So to step back from that, so for some patients, I might just want to decrease glucose and insulin levels. And I can do that by getting rid of sweets. For other patients, like patients with schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, especially if it's chronic, if I'm using it as a brain treatment, then I do want a ketogenic diet. And I usually want reasonably high levels of blood ketones. Usually, for depression, I want to see at least greater than probably 0.8 minimal. For psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder, I usually want to see levels greater than 1.5. That's what I'm shooting for, if at all possible. So yeah, I think that's what I'd go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so-- and sorry, I didn't mean to imply that people need to be in ketosis in order to see some mental health benefits from changing their diet. You make very clear in your book-- and we'll go into this in more detail-- that avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin resistance, and essentially trying to reverse what earlier you described as this metabolic syndrome, which is a bunch of different things, is the target. And for some people, getting rid of highly processed foods and focusing mainly on nonprocessed or minimally processed foods will really help. For others, going straight to the full-blown ketogenic diet will be of most benefit. I'd like to back up a little bit in history and get to something which I find incredibly interesting, which is epilepsy and the longstanding use of ketogenic diet and fasting to treat epilepsy. And the reason I want to kind of rewind to that point in history is that, I think that for a lot of listeners and people out there who are familiar with how changing your diet or changing your exercise can positively impact sleep and weight and all these things, and it cascades into feeling better-- that makes perfect sense. But for a lot of the world still, the idea that changing or using nutrition as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool to understand and treat mental illness, is still a kind of heretical idea, that to them, it kind of falls in the, OK, well, that's like a woo science or something like that. Now, obviously you're a board-certified physician or psychiatrist at arguably one of the finest medical schools in the world, Harvard Medical School. Even though I'm on the Stanford side, we acknowledge-- we acknowledge our East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: You're the Harvard-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of the West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're not going to talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're not going to talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Or we're the Stanford of the East Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That argument could go back and forth a number of times. You're a serious clinician and a serious scientist. And you're a serious thinker. But for a lot of people out there, the notion of using diet, they immediately think, ah, well, that makes perfect sense. Or I think there's a category of people who think, well, yeah, didn't Atkins die of a heart attack? I hear that a lot. That was crazy. People immediately discard the Atkins diet for that reason, which I do think is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. But it's an interesting thing nonetheless. And then I think that the majority of people sit in the middle and just want to see science and medicine come up with treatments that work. And I have to say, I'm very relieved to hear what you said earlier, which was-- you never said that people should come off their medication and just become-- go on a ketogenic diet and everything will be cured. You're certainly not saying that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And rather you're saying, if I understand correctly, that nutrition needs to be considered one of the major tools in the landscape of effective tools and that it can be very effective, evidenced by the story that you shared. And there are many other stories in there as well of truly miraculous transformations. So let's talk about epilepsy and how the ketogenic diet is not just used for epilepsy but is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, examples of the use of nutrition to treat a condition of the nervous system that can be incredibly debilitating, even deadly. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. And the reality is that this literature, and this clinical history, and all of the research we have was the godsend that I needed to do the work that I'm doing. Otherwise, I would have been discredited on day one. Chris Palmer is claiming that a dietary change can influence schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. That's impossible. And he's a quack. But the thing that immediately got me credibility was I didn't focus on it as a diet. I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature. So the ketogenic diet, unbeknownst to most people, was actually developed a hundred years ago, 1921, by a physician for one and only one purpose-- to treat epilepsy. It wasn't developed as a weight loss diet. It wasn't developed as the diet that all human beings should follow. And the reason it was developed is because of this longstanding observation, since the time of Hippocrates, that fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting is not a healthy diet. Fasting is the process of no diet. So we now understand a tremendous amount of science. Most people think going without food is bad. And they equate it with starvation. But in fact, when we go without food, it causes tremendous shifts in metabolism-- both brain and body metabolism. And it puts the body into a mode of autophagy, and conservation of resources, and all sorts of things that are beneficial to human health. And this is why fasting has been used as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture, in almost every religion for a millennia. But for the most part, that was all thought to be religious folklore. That was just crazy talk. And those stupid people way back then thought God cured everything. And so they fasted. And they just assumed that they were getting better. Well, in 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting on a child with seizures and found that, oh, Lo and behold, this religious folklore stuff has something to it. It actually worked. The problem with fasting is that you can only fast for so long before you starve to death. And that's not a very effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child was ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: So no special diet. But the problem with fasting for epilepsy is that as soon as people start eating a normal diet again, their seizures usually come right back-- oftentimes, with a vengeance. And so it can be a good short-term intervention. The fasting can take a few days because it can take a few days to get ketosis. And then you can get some relief from chronic seizures. But it's not a good long-term treatment because, again, people will starve to death. As soon as they start eating, seizures come back. So it was actually Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic who developed the ketogenic diet with one and only one purpose. He wanted to see, can we mimic the fasting state, using this special diet, to see if it might stop seizures long-term? And lo and behold, it worked. Early results were extraordinarily positive. 50% of patients who use the ketogenic diet became seizure-free. And another 35% had a 50% or greater reduction in their seizure frequency, so about 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry to interrupt. I didn't mean to do that there. Was it just for pediatric epilepsy or for adult epilepsy as well? CHRIS PALMER: So back in the 1920s, we didn't have many anti-epilepsy treatments. And a lot of adults were struggling as well. So they were using it on anybody who would do the diet. By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals were coming out. And we had many more anticonvulsant treatments. And there's no question, they work for a lot of people. That's great. And taking a pill is so much easier than doing this diet. So the diet pretty much fell out of favor. And nobody was using it from the 1950s to about the '70s. But lo and behold, even to this day, people with epilepsy, about 30% don't respond to the current treatments that we have available. 30% will have treatment resistant epilepsy, which means they continue to have seizures no matter how many anticonvulsants they're taking, even if they've had brain surgery. It just doesn't stop their seizures. And so in the 1970s, the ketogenic diet was resurrected at Johns Hopkins for these treatment-resistant cases. And lo and behold, it works-- not for all of them, but it works in-- about 1/3 become seizure-free. And these are people who've tried everything and nothing's working. So 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get a clinical benefit, meaning a 50% or greater reduction in their seizure frequency. And the other third, it doesn't seem to work. It's not always clear if that's because of noncompliance or if that's because the diet's just not working. But about a third, a third, a third-- seizure freedom, reduction in seizures, or it just doesn't work. And so the reality, the godsend for me is that we have decades of neuroscience research on the ketogenic diet and what it is doing to the brain. We know that the ketogenic diet is influencing neurotransmitter levels-- in particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. It changes calcium channel regulation and calcium levels, which is really important in the function of cells. It changes gene expression. It reduces brain inflammation. It changes the gut microbiome. Gut microbiome is a huge topic right now. And there are some researchers who argue that is the primary benefit of the ketogenic diet-- it's changing the gut microbiome in beneficial ways. So it's doing a lot of things. It obviously improves insulin resistance. It lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, which improves insulin signaling. The key for my research that I've outlined, the real magic, is that this diet stimulates two processes that relate to mitochondria. It stimulates a process called mitophagy, which is getting rid of old and defective mitochondria, and replacing them with new ones. And it also stimulates a process called mitochondrial biogenesis, which means that after people have done the ketogenic diet for a while-- months or years-- many of their cells in their bodies and brains will have more mitochondria. And those mitochondria will be healthier. And I believe that is the reason the ketogenic diet is such a powerful treatment not only for epilepsy but also for people with chronic mental disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Would you mind listing off a few of the mental disorders? And I know this is not meant to be inside ball, but we should distinguish between psychiatric disorders and neurological symptoms and diseases. The fields of psychiatry and neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. But for instance, typically if somebody is presenting with something that looks like Alzheimer's, dementia, they'll talk to a neurologist. Whereas, if somebody is presenting with symptoms, like schizophrenia, bipolar, they'll talk to a psychiatrist. But if you wouldn't mind wearing a dual hat, could you just quickly list off some of the neurologic and psychiatric disorders for which ketogenic-- or let's just say-- nutrition changes have been shown to improve symptoms significantly. And then maybe we can dive into a couple of these as well as get more deeply into these two very interesting aspects of mitochondrial function and repair and turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. In terms of nutritional psychiatry, it's a broad field. And it's in its infancy, is the real answer. If you're looking for randomized controlled trials documenting efficacy in large numbers of patients with these disorders, we don't have them. They're underway now. But we don't have them yet. What we do have are case studies. We have a lot of mechanistic science papers by some of the leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists in the world-- and neurologists in the world kind of outlining, this is everything we know that the ketogenic diet is doing. These are the problems in the brains of people with these chronic mental or neurological disorders. So we know that they should work. But the disorders range from chronic depression to-- we've got a trial underway for PTSD. We've got one actually decent pilot trial from the National Institutes of Health for the ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder, of all things. And we can go into that a little more. We've got a couple of pilot trials of the ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's disease. And those are randomized controlled trials. We've got case studies of the ketogenic diet for chronic depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The largest study that we've got in that mental health sphere is a pilot study of 31 patients admitted to a French hospital. 28 of those patients were able to do the diet and stay on the diet. So 10%, off the bat, noncompliant, couldn't do the diet. So we need to include that. But of the 28 patients who were able to do-- and these are 28 patients with treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Of the patients who were able to do the ketogenic diet, 100% had at least some improvement in symptoms. 46% had remission of illness. Remission of illness, that does not happen with current treatments. And 64%, I think, were discharged on less medicine than they went into the hospital on. So it wasn't that the people were prescribing more medicine and that's why. They were being discharged on less medication. We've got at least-- again, a lot of the hard core scientists are going to say, show us the randomized controlled trial with hundreds of patients. And we've got five randomized controlled trials underway now, funded primarily through philanthropy. I can tell you that-- we've talked about that one index patient. But at this point, I have now treated dozens of patients. And I've heard from hundreds of patients who've been treated by other clinicians, researchers-- or I've just heard from patients from around the world-- who have shared stories of complete remission of long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia-- off of psychiatric meds. Some of them-- not all of them, but some of them are able to get off all psychiatric meds and remain in remission. Again, I think I didn't say this before. But it's really important to mention. For people who might be unfamiliar with the mental health field and its connection with epilepsy, the reason that it's such an important connection is that we use epilepsy treatments in psychiatric patients every day in tens of millions of people. So a lot of people don't know this, but I'll list off some names that a lot of your listeners may have heard of. And they probably know them as psychiatric drugs. But in fact, these are epilepsy drugs. Depakote, Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin or gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax-- those are all medications that stop seizures. And many of them were developed initially for seizures. But we, in the mental health field, quickly steal them and start using them in tens of millions of people, even if they're off label. So that means, we don't have research studies documenting that they're effective. But we go ahead and use them anyway because the reality is far too many patients aren't getting better with the FDA-approved treatments that we do have to offer. So psychiatrists are just winging it in some cases. And we're just throwing whatever we can at them and we absolutely include epilepsy treatments. So in many ways, using the ketogenic diet as a treatment for serious mental disorders, is nothing new at all. It's an established evidence-based treatment for epilepsy. We use evidence-based treatments for epilepsy across the board for a wide range of mental disorders. And so in many ways, that's all I'm doing with the ketogenic diet. It just happens to be a diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. I love it. And I should say, I love it because we had a guest on here early days of the podcast. He's a colleague of mine at Stanford. He's a bioengineer, and a psychiatrist, phenomenal scientist and psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, who won the Lasker prize, and so on and so forth. And he made a really important point, which should have been obvious to me but wasn't until he said it, which was the psychiatrist has tools, just like the surgeon has tools. But the tools are language and observing behavior. Those are the dissection tools for what's going on in someone's brain. And then as a neuroscientist, I'm familiar with the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. And you mentioned that-- and there are these tools of altering brain chemistry, which are of the sorts of drugs you just listed off, or antidepressants, or antipsychotics, that fall into these major bins of adjusting dopamine or adjusting serotonin or some combination of dopamine, serotonin epinephrine, adenosine, and on, and on, and on. And it seems to me, it's an incredible field. But that the field is still very much in its infancy that it wasn't about a hundred years ago that people were measuring bumps on the head as a way to diagnose phrenology, and that there's still so much to learn. And so when I hear you say, adjusting nutrition or putting people into a ketogenic state or even just eliminating highly processed foods, sugars, et cetera, taking care of metabolic syndrome, and then observing tremendous relief in clinical syndromes of-- or symptoms, rather, of psychiatric disorders, it makes perfect sense to me. It's yet another dissection tool. And a tool for altering brain chemistry. If I think about the landscape, the sort of sociology out there of-- again, there seem to be these bins, like a third of people saying, of course, diet, and exercise, and social connection, and limiting stress, that's the good stuff. That's the stuff that we really works. And then about a third of people are sort of unclear. And then a third of people think, well, if it's not a prescription drug, then it just has no place in medicine. And hopefully, that's changing. And certainly, the work that you're doing is going to be important in that transition that I think we will see. I'd like to talk about mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. I think most people learn that the mitochondria are the energy factories of cells and that indeed, they are. As a neuroscientist, what I know about them is that they are present everywhere in neurons. Not just in the so-called cell body, but you can find mitochondria in the furthest little bits of neurons. And neurons can be quite big, very large. In fact, meters long or more in some cases and some species, including us. Depending on how tall somebody is, could be many meters-- or several meters rather. And that mitochondria do a lot of stuff besides just produce energy, because I think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," and they think, oh, so these patients felt better. They lost weight. They had more energy. And then they're doing better. But here we're talking about remission of auditory hallucinations, people feeling suicidal and then changing their diet and feeling like life is something they can deal with, and maybe even function extremely well, and et cetera. So maybe we could just talk about mitochondria for a moment. And then talk about these two major effects. What are some of the other things that mitochondria are important for in neurons and maybe other cells of the brain? Because as an access point for all this, I think it would be great if people could learn a little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: So I guess the first thing that I'll say is that this field is one of the most cutting-edge fields in medicine right now. 20 years ago or so, I think the majority of research scientists thought of mitochondria as nothing more than little batteries. They take food and oxygen and turn it into ATP. And that's really important. Yeah, we get that. But they're just little batteries. That's all they are. And so one of the reasons that this work is so important it's because it combines cutting-edge research in the metabolic field in the aging field. And we can start to pair it with a mental health and neurological health field. So mitochondria-- one scientist gave me this analogy. He said, if you think of the cell as a computer, a lot of people think of mitochondria as the power cord to that computer because they're providing the power. And they are, in fact, the power cord to that computer. But actually, their real function is the motherboard of that computer. So mitochondria are directing in allocating resources throughout a cell. That is their primary function. And then they happen to be powerhouses as well. And so to give some clear examples, mitochondria play a direct role in the production, and release, and regulation of some really key neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine. Those are pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I would call those-- I would consider those the-- I know you listed more than three. But the sort of primary colors of neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Any one of those in excess or deficiency is going to have profound negative effects on a nervous system. Or it's going to alter the way that people and animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER: So mitochondria are providing both some of the building blocks, if you will, for some of those molecules that are part of the Krebs, citric acid cycle. Some of the intermediate products actually go into making those neurotransmitters. Much more importantly, mitochondria provide the energy for the production of those neurotransmitters. And fascinatingly, mitochondria are directly related to the release of neurotransmitters. ATP alone is not enough. There have been some research studies that have actually found that mitochondria move along the membrane of the synapse to release batches of vesicles of neurotransmitters, and that if the mitochondria are removed from the synapse and researchers flood that cell with ATP, neurotransmitters usually are not getting released. Mitochondria are doing other things. We don't entirely even understand what all they're doing or how they're doing it. But they're doing other things than just providing the power. Another really important example is that mitochondria are actually the primary regulators of epigenetics. If you look at any one factor-- so one study actually found that they're responsible for the expression of about 60% of the genes in a cell. And mitochondria do this through a lot of ways that have been known for years and sometimes decades. So mitochondria are directly related to the levels of reactive oxygen species in a cell. They are managing calcium regulation in cells. And we know that those things play a role in epigenetic expression. We know the levels of ATP to ADP or AMP also play a role. And mitochondria are doing those things. But it turns out, mitochondria are actually doing much more sophisticated things than even those in terms of gene expression. Mitochondria at least play a role in all of the aspects of the human stress response. So when humans are stressed, either physically or psychologically, there are several things that happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline, inflammation, and gene expression-- in particular, in the hippocampus-- occur with the stress response. And one group of researchers actually genetically modified mitochondria in four different ways, and found that all of the stress response, all those four buckets of stress response were impacted in one way or another, implying that mitochondria are somehow playing a role in those. In terms of their role in cortisol, we know that mitochondria actually have the enzyme required for the synthesis of steroid hormones. So that includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, some names that maybe everybody's heard of. so that means that if mitochondria are in short supply or dysfunctional, the production of those hormones may become dysregulated. Mitochondria play a direct role in inflammation. And they turn the inflammatory system both on-- or they at least play a role in turning the inflammatory system both on and off. I'm not going to be able to quote the exact study and author. But one paper in cell actually identified mitochondria as the key regulator in turning certain inflammatory cells off, and that when you inhibit mitochondrial function, those cells don't turn off, that mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species are a key signaling process to turn the inflammatory cell process off. Another study found that macrophages-- so macrophages are an important immune cell that play a role in healing. So if you cut yourself, your body will get-- send inflammation that way and send immune cells that way to try to heal your skin. And macrophages play an important role in that healing. One group of researchers tried to figure out how do macrophages know to switch between the different phases of wound healing because the macrophages do different things in the different phases of wound healing. And the conclusion of all of their research was that it's mitochondria. Mitochondria are sending the essential signals that change the state of the macrophages to induce these different phases of wound healing. So I've just talked about neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. For anybody familiar with the mental health field, they know these are some of the key variables that researchers have been struggling with for decades, trying to figure out how do these fit together. We know that all of those buckets can be disrupted in people with mental disorders. And our field has struggled to understand, but how do they fit together? How can we make sense of this disruption? And I believe once you understand the science of mitochondria, you can actually connect all of the dots of the mental illness puzzle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth. But you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get $200 off an ultimate plan or 34% off the entire site as a special Black Friday deal now through the end of November. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman and use the code Huberman at checkout. Super interesting little subcellular goodies, these mitochondria are. I come from a field where people are often divided into lumpers and splitters. And I'm somewhere in between. For those of you who don't know, lumpers are people that like to make things really simple-- lists of no more than three functions or dividing brain areas into no more than three. Splitters are people that like to subdivide into a ton of detail. There's a history of scientists being splitters in order to be able to name things after themselves because-- CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's more territory to go around if you're splitting than if you're lumping. But we are doing neither here. What I'm hearing is that mitochondria, in addition to being important sources of energy production and output in cells-- which, of course, they are-- probably have other roles. Maybe someday, what we call mitochondria will actually be two or three different little subcellular or organelles. There may be little bits in there that are controlling gene expression and little bits in there that are controlling neurotransmitter production. But at least for now, the name is mitochondria. And thank you, by the way, for illustrating some of the other things that they do because in the landscape of science education, oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll be a picture or a cartoon of mitochondria flexing its muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty mitochondria. And then they'll think, oh, they're just sort of like a dumb jock portion of the cell. They're not doing anything sophisticated. And everything you listed off is that they are doing many sophisticated intricate things within cells. So I think how things are cartooned and discussed actually has an impact-- and not just on the general public, but on the medical field and on the science fields. Anyway, that's more science sociology. But now that everyone is well aware that mitochondria are doing a large number of very important things in a very regulated way, let's talk about mitophagy. A few years ago, because a Nobel Prize was given for autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look, people, you can say it either way. People will know hopefully what it means is more important, which is the gobbling up of one's own cells that are dead or injured. And this idea of autophagy, of cells being eaten up within a system-- nervous system or other system-- has come up again and again. I actually wasn't aware that mitophagy could be such an important lever. So tell us about mitophagy, which I have to presume is the, intentional or not, gobbling up of mitochondria, presumably to replace them with newer healthier mitochondria. Is that right? CHRIS PALMER: It is. So in many ways, mitophagy is a subset of autophagy. But it's got its own name because it is specific to mitochondria. There do appear to be some unique regulators of mitophagy compared to autophagy more broadly. Mitochondria actually are playing a role in autophagy itself. And this makes sense because one of-- so the global picture of autophagy is stimulated by fasting states or fasting-mimicking states. So when your body senses that you don't have enough food, it actually hunkers down and starts to recycle dead old parts in this kind of carefully orchestrated way. And it takes them to lysosomes. They get degraded. And then those degradation products get used for either energy or to build new things. Autophagy is always occurring at a low level. But you can really hyperstimulate the process through fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, other things. And this is why fasting and calorie restriction is so kind of such hot topics in the medical field now. It's because they've been shown to induce longevity. And we think it's probably through that process that you're stimulating the body to kind of become lean and conservative in terms of its allocation of resources. And the body doesn't just destroy the healthiest tissue along with the old dead stuff. It has these processes that identify the old and defective parts first. And they go first. And that's what's beautiful about the whole thing. And that's why fasting is so important. So mitophagy we know plays a really important role because-- so there's this term called mitochondrial dysfunction, which some researchers are actually wanting to get rid of and move away from because, as you just said, mitochondria do so many different things. And different mitochondria even within the same cell may very well be specializing in different tasks. And mitochondria from one cell to another are sometimes doing very different things, like not all mitochondria can produce cortisol. That's specific to specific cells where those genes are getting turned on. So it's not like all mitochondria are producing cortisol. Just the ones in your adrenal gland, for instance, are producing cortisol. But there is this term "mitochondrial dysfunction." And it has long been known, for decades, that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with everything that ails us essentially. So in the 1950s, we had a theory of aging that was based on reactive oxygen species. And that's where all the inflammation is bad for you comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all the noise about antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like in the '90s, it was like, it contains antioxidants. Not to say antioxidants are bad, but they are certainly not the be-all-end-all of health. CHRIS PALMER: They are not. But that's exactly where that research came from, is that researchers were narrowing in on these reactive oxygen species are highly, highly correlated with all of the diseases of aging and poor health outcomes. It turns out, they're also highly, highly correlated with all chronic mental disorders interestingly. So researchers used the antioxidants to see if, well, maybe if we can stop, somehow tame these reactive oxygen species, we'll improve health outcomes. Doesn't seem to work. By the 1970s, our understanding of mitochondria and their role in the production of reactive oxygen species expanded. And that led to the mitochondrial theory of aging. So in the 1970s, we had this mitochondrial theory of aging, based primarily and exclusively on reactive oxygen species. Fast forward a couple of decades, that was disproven because we now reactive oxygen species aren't all bad. They actually serve a signaling process. They're a normal part of human functioning and cellular function. So they're not all bad. But we still know high levels of reactive oxygen species are bad for you. Fast forward to just, I think, maybe last year, with this expanded role of all of the different things mitochondria are doing. So David Sinclair published a paper in one of the cell journals, I think, saying that, oh, mitochondria are actually the unifying link of everything that we know about aging. Mitochondria are the cause-- or defective mitochondria or defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction, is possibly the unifying cause of aging and all of the aging related disorders. So mitophagy is trying to address all that. It's trying to say, OK, this is bad. We don't want defective mitochondria and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones and replace them with new ones. And I think the most powerful signal and tool that we have right now is, in fact, related to diet. It's calorie restriction. That is the oldest, truest, kind of best-proven way to prevent aging in a wide variety of animal species-- fasting and intermittent fasting. And again, you can only do those things for so long. And then fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate this process of mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk about mitochondrial biogenesis, if-- and I certainly accept the idea that mitochondria are extremely important in physical health and mental health. That's, for me, is a straightforward conclusion at this point, based on what you've said, whatever and elsewhere, et cetera. And if various diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can assist in mitochondrial function and mitophagy-- and that's at least one of the levers by which diet can positively impact mental health and physical health, can we conclude that there's something special about low blood glucose in the brain? The sort of common pathway of all of those things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- for some people, maybe they-- maybe some people have great insulin management, so just removing sweets, refined sugars, brings down their blood glucose level substantially. They don't need to go on a ketogenic diet in order to relieve a low level depression or something like that. Seems like the common theme here is that glucose levels in the brain need to be reduced, which for me, is surprising because neurons love glucose. There are some really nice studies. One that I can think of recently that was published in Neuron, if you just look at the tuning of a neuron, how well a neuron in the brain represents some visual image in the environment in terms-- here, we can just generalize and say, more action potentials, more electrical signals from the neuron generally correlates with better high fidelity representation. It's sort of if everyone's time someone says, shout, and then someone shouts, the neuron is the one responding to the order. And these neurons just, when there's high glucose, they are faithful representatives of what's out there in the world. But then when you fast an animal, they become less faithful representatives of what's out there. And yet when I've done intermittent fasting, and I do a kind of modified version of it, my mental clarity is far better than when I've had a big bowl of pasta-- probably for other reasons related to serotonin and tryptophan. So I think for the typical listener out there, I have to imagine, it's got to be a little confusing. We hear neurons love glucose. They live on glucose. And here, we're saying, let's deprive them of some glucose. Or let's just bring glucose levels down. Or let's switch the fuel source of the brain from glucose to ketones. And now the brain really works the way it's supposed to. So this raises a little bit of just so story question, like why would it be the case that neurons love glucose, and yet if there's too much glucose around, they become sick? And of course, with any why-would-it-be story, as I would say, I wasn't consulted at the design phase. And I'm going to presume that you weren't consulted the design-- CHRIS PALMER: I was not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. And that if any of us say that we are, then we are probably the patients that need evaluation. So I think there's a name for that. There's delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK. I threw out my first correct clinical assessment of myself. So how do I get my head around this? You've got me sold on mitochondria-- not that I needed to be sold. But that's an easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. The idea that diet can impact mental health and physical health-- yes, absolutely-- by way of mitochondria-- at least in part, great. But then neurons love glucose. So what's going on? Or what do you think is going on? CHRIS PALMER: I am not convinced that glucose is the real story. Glucose may, in fact, be a symptom. We know that parts of the brain-- there have been a couple of studies that just came out in the last couple of weeks, I think, documenting that actually astrocytes in the hypothalamus play a key role in glucose regulation throughout the body. And it appears to be a metabolic role, which in my mind, implies that the mitochondria in those astrocytes are probably playing a key role because we know mitochondria play a key role in sensing glucose levels. They play a key role in the release of insulin from the pancreas. But mitochondria in the brain is also playing a role in kind of balancing how much glucose is around. And so it's a difficult question because I think in some cases, high glucose levels are actually a symptom of metabolic dysfunction somewhere in the body or brain. And when I think about, well, what does that mean? In my mind, most of the evidence currently is pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere in the body or brain. That is the most likely cause of that dysregulation of glucose levels. But we know that if you consume massive amounts of junk food, sugar, and other things, that you can get dysregulation of glucose levels. The conundrum, though, is that that's not a universal response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what about the typical person? I've never really liked junk food that much. Maybe as a kid, I can recall liking candy. But I was a sandwich for lunch person for a long time. And as I've changed that out for salad and maybe a small piece of meat with my salad or something like that, I feel far better during the day, far more alert. But I do eat carbohydrates. I eat starches typically at night. But I tend to do some very hard training at some point during the day. So I imagine I have some glycogen to repack. OK. That's me. I only mentioned that because I'm not in ketosis as far as I know. I haven't-- unless you brought the strips, I haven't done the blood glucose test today. So what about the typical person who's an omnivore eating some rice, some pasta, pasta salads, people that are eating not junk food massive amounts of sugar but have blood glucose that's in kind of moderate range? Do you think-- and here, feel free to speculate. Do you think that those people might feel far better-- or even a little bit better-- if they were in a lower glucose state? And I ask this because I think there are a lot of people out there who suffer from full-blown depression. But there are also a lot of people who suffer from moodiness and feeling not so great, subclinical depression. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout is what I would call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just feeling some days are great, and then other days, they feel lousy for reasons they don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And those make for less dramatic case studies. And yet I have to assume that that description will net a large fraction of the general public. CHRIS PALMER: So the way that I kind of break this field-- and I'm probably getting too nerdy right now. But I kind of break this field into cause-- what's the actual root cause-- and what are effective treatments. And I really see them as two separate things. Just because the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment, does not imply that the cause of the problem was eating carbohydrates. And I think that's a really important distinction. There are many people who disagree with me on that. There's no doubt about it. And everybody's heard people say, sugar is the cause of everything that ails you. Or carbs are the cause of everything that ails you. If everybody does a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet-- and then they go to, so it must be sugar that was the cause. I don't see it as clearly black and white as that. Calorie restriction, ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction are inducing metabolic changes in the brain and body. And regardless of what the person was eating, they are inducing metabolic changes that can be really beneficial to brain health. So let me just give a clear black and white example of this. And then I can speak to the broader topic that you brought up about just the general population. The easy example of the ketogenic diet being an effective intervention for somebody who was not following a bad diet is an infant with epilepsy. There are lots of infants who have uncontrollable seizures. They are drinking breast milk. To the best of our knowledge, that is the primary, most beneficial food source an infant could be consuming. Now, some might say, well, maybe the mother is-- whatever, I don't buy that. The mother's breast milk is, in fact, the optimal food source for that infant. And yet that infant is still seizing. If we put that infant on a ketogenic diet, a lot of those infants seizures will stop. It doesn't mean that the cause of the infant seizures was a bad diet. But it means that dietary intervention can change brain metabolism and improve symptoms in that person. So going to your broader question about adults, modern-day, the real answer is-- there was just this conference in London, the Royal College of obesity medicine or something like that. That's not the name. But it's something along those lines. The conclusion of that conference that invited the greatest minds in obesity medicine, the overarching conclusion of that conference was we don't know what causes obesity. It's really important that we sit with that. We don't know what causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They don't think excess caloric intake beyond one's daily metabolic needs is causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: Some will argue that. And so some will say yes, it's all energy balance. But why do we have an epidemic of obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, that's the N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. Some will say, it's all the junk food. But we had junk food in the 1970s. When I was growing up, I grew up on Kool-Aid, and Twinkies, and King Dons, and HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching the Mad Men series now. I love that series, and I'm rewatching it. And I happen to know someone who worked on that series. They researched everything for the props, and the costumes, everything, right down to diet. And if you look at the diet, it was terrible. It was mostly-- yes, there was a lot of excessive amounts of drinking and cigarette smoking. But the diets were terrible. It was pre-packaged foods. It was frozen dinners. That really came to prominence in the '70s and '80s. But even in the '50s and, from what I've been reading, even in the '30s and '40s, people were not eating grass-fed meat and Brazil nuts with a little bit of broccoli rabe on the side. That's not the typical intake. So something out there-- or maybe multiple things-- are at play to increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER: And at the end of the day, I believe-- some will call this speculative. But I actually think we've got a tremendous amount of evidence that continues to point in this direction. I believe that mitochondria are the key to the obesity epidemic, that there is something in our environment. So that is either our food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep, not getting adequate sunlight, whatever you want to speculate on, all of the above, all of those things are known to impair mitochondrial function. And if parts of your brain that regulate metabolism and that regulate eating behaviors are not metabolically healthy, it means that they will not stop you from eating. Or it means that your metabolism will not rise to the challenge of 10 donuts, because some people can eat 10 donuts and go on staying thin and healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I totally agree. Although, I would just like to say that it seems to me that compared to when I was growing up-- and again, I haven't run the statistics-- there are fewer and fewer of those individuals around now. Just as when I was growing up, it was one or two kids in class that were quite overweight. And then there were some that were mildly overweight. But most were of healthy weight. Nowadays, that's dramatically altered. The landscape is dramatically altered in the other direction. It is rare when I encounter one of those can-eat-anything type people. I know one, he's actually an employee at Stanford. He's in our media team at Stanford. And this guy, when I take him to lunch, it's like-- he's in his early 70s, and he can eat. And he's incredibly lean. He exercises a little bit. But he's one of these mutants that just can eat, and eat, and eat, and he's lean and he's vital, and he's-- it's wild. And he's an expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: But those people are seem rare. And even those kids are now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER: They're getting increasingly rare. And that leads me to think it may be epigenetic factors in the womb environment, so that kids are actually coming out predisposed to obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let me ask you about that because I had a note here to ask this later. But I'm going to interrupt you now in order to capture this moment. My understanding is that-- well, as everyone knows, we inherit DNA. We get genes from both of our parents. And they mix. Although there are incredible data from Catherine Dulac's lab at Harvard and others showing that we actually have entire regions of our brain that carry neurons that are of purely of mom's or of dad's DNA, depending on the brain region. This is a wild finding. But it's accurate. And this has actually been known about in terms of heritability of disease, et cetera. Maternal DNA, DNA from mom, genes from our mother-- not to place blame on mothers at all. My understanding is that the mitochondrial DNA come exclusively through the maternal side. Is that true? CHRIS PALMER: So it's a great question. And I've been asked this before. And yeah, psychiatrists are known for blaming mothers. And some might say that I'm trying to redo that whole thing and blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The data are the data. I'm not trying to blame mothers here. Mothers play an essential role in everything. But if it is true that mitochondria are the linchpin of all this and maternal DNA is what determines the mitochondrial DNA, I think it's an important place to look. CHRIS PALMER: It's an important question. And the answer is unequivocally no. That's not the way it works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then vindication for anyone that was asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: And so let me explain it. So mitochondria have 36 genes unto themselves. 13 of those genes code for some of the mitochondrial machinery of making ATP. And the other 36 play roles in epigenetic regulation, play roles in whole body metabolism, and other things. So that is what you're inheriting from your mom. It's the mitochondria and those 36 genes for the most part. But the majority of proteins that make up mitochondria, over, I think, 1,300 genes that make up mitochondria are actually encoded in the nuclear DNA. And so you inherit a copy from both your mother and your father. So the majority of people who have mitochondrial defects or rare mitochondrial diseases actually could inherit them from either mom or dad because it can be a defect in the nuclear genes that code for proteins that make up mitochondria. The much bigger issue when-- so when I talk about mitochondrial dysfunction being a primary driver of mental illness, metabolic illness, it's not that people inherit a defective mitochondrion or mitochondria from mom, and then that just ruins their life forever. That's actually not the way it works. The beautiful thing about this theory is that it connects all of the risk factors that we already know play a role in mental health but also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria and mitochondrial function. Stress, high levels of stress and trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug and alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- in terms of the smoke-- and marijuana-- THC, in particular-- all impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC directly or the smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. Those studies have been done. So mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors right on them. And various researchers, a couple of studies from Nature actually documented this, that the mitochondrial CB1 receptors are primary-- kind of primary points of the influence of marijuana on human behaviors and effects. Because when they remove CB1 receptors in animal models, these changes don't happen. So the CB1 receptors-- we've got some large studies of adolescents who use a lot of marijuana. And the areas where the mitochondria have the greatest number of CB1 receptors are areas of their brains that actually are atrophied or shrunk compared to normal healthy controls. So that means their brain tissue is aging prematurely. It's shrinking prematurely. But the CB1 receptors on mitochondria also seem to play a role in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC. And they also play a role in the kind of lack of motivation, the behavioral amotivational state from THC. Now, again, for people who want to chillax, that's what they're looking for. They don't want to remember anything. They don't want to think. They want to be spaced out. They want to relax. That's great. But it's important that they know that they're actually harming the mitochondria in their brain cells. And that although there's always an opportunity to repair mitochondria and always an opportunity to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, so you can get it back, but if you keep doing it chronically, you're probably not helping your overall mental or metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm glad you brought up THC. We did an episode on cannabis. We also did one on alcohol-- probably lost some friends from that one. When you look at the data, it's very clear. I'm not arguing that people dislike the effects of these compounds when they take them. But it is clear that, at least to me, based on the data that regardless of what people have read about red wine, that not drinking any alcohol is going to be healthier than drinking alcohol, and that the thresholds for alcohol ingestion before people start to negatively impact their health is about one or two per week. And then THC, because of the very high concentrations of THC that are present in a lot of products now-- vaping and smoking THC and even edibles-- that it can be problematic. You mentioned adolescents that predisposition, and brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera. In any case, because you mentioned alcohol because it is a commonly used substance, I heard you give a talk in which-- I think I have this right-- in which alcohol can disrupt the way that the brain uses fuels of all kinds, which may disrupt one's response to alcohol, make alcohol seem more rewarding to those that drink alcohol. So drinking alcohol makes alcohol more rewarding to the brains of alcohol drinkers, but that it also might alter glucose metabolism, that basically alcohol is not good for our brains. Do I have that correct? CHRIS PALMER: You do have that correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. What happens if you take an alcoholic or somebody that just drinks two to four nights a week a couple of drinks, which I think is pretty common out there, and you put them on a ketogenic diet? Has that experiment been done? CHRIS PALMER: That experiment has been done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: It led by none other than a woman named Nora Volkow, who is one of the leading neuroscientists and addiction researchers in the world. She is the director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse. She's been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder, which I will just refer to as alcoholics because that's what everybody knows it as. So she's been hot on this trail for many, many years. And as you said, it turns out that the reward pathways, in particular, are metabolically compromised in alcoholics. And the metabolic compromise essentially, in a nutshell, means they aren't getting enough fuel from glucose. The interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol, your liver converts alcohol into a molecule called acetate. That acetate travels up to the brain and fuels brain cells, in particular, some of these reward pathway cells more than others. And so chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation of energy in these cells. And so Nora Volkow and other researchers at the National Institutes of Health did a study in which they set out to see if we can change this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics. Will that affect clinical symptoms of alcoholism? And will it do anything? It's clinically useful. And so they actually did a pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics to a detox unit. Half of the patients got a ketogenic diet. The other half got the standard American diet. And then everybody else, all of them got the same detox protocol. The patients who got the ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines for their detox. Despite that, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms from the alcohol. They reported fewer cravings for alcohol. And the researchers did brain scans, which showed improved brain metabolism in these key areas that they were looking at. And their brains showed reduced levels of neuroinflammation, which was also something they were really interested in. And so that one study says to us that even though most people would think alcoholism has nothing to do with diet, alcohol is just drinking too much. It's a matter of willpower. Or it's somebody who's addictive. They've got an addictive personality, and it's that simple. You come out of the womb with an addictive personality. And those people are novelty seekers, and they're impulsive. And they have no patience. They have no discipline. They can't sustain any kind of rewarding experience. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or childhood trauma. There's a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --story there, which there very well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER: And there may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: But what that research study strongly suggests-- and again, yes, maybe we need larger controlled trials. But this is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world who's hot on this trail. This is what she believes. And this is what I believe. It's that if we can correct the brain metabolic defects from chronic alcohol use, we might be able to help people be sober and give them a fighting chance. Or give them an edge up or pull a lever that we can use in their favor, for their benefit. There's one caution to all of this research that I really do want to highlight. And so now, I'm going to get hate mail from all the keto community. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's OK. I admire you for talking about nutrition at all because anytime one talks about nutrition, you're going to get hate mail from somebody. CHRIS PALMER: So the caveat to all of this is that as part of the research that those researchers were doing, they actually wanted to see what will happen to alcohol levels if an animal consumes alcohol while on a ketogenic diet. So they didn't do this in humans yet. This is a fairly easy study to do. So I'm hoping somebody will do this study soon. But they instead put rats half of them on a standard diet and half of them on a ketogenic diet. And then they exposed them to the exact same amount of alcohol. The rats who were on the ketogenic diet had a five-fold increase in blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, they drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it was metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER: It was metabolized differently. The rats all got the same amount of alcohol. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people out there who are ketogenic, I'm chuckling, but who are not alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please do something about it because it's so detrimental. But I guess does this mean that they can drink less in order to get the effect of alcohol that most people are seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date is what you call that. You only need a half a drink instead of three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would think the keto community would thank you for this unless they somehow have a stake in the alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: The reason that I put it as a caution is that if anybody is struggling with alcoholism and thinks hey, I need an edge up. I need a lever to pull because I'm really struggling to give this stuff up. I just find myself going back. And if you're telling me my brain metabolism is messed up, and this might help it, I'm all in favor of that. And yes, that's what the researchers are pursuing. And that's what I'm saying with the following caveat-- that if you relapse while on a ketogenic diet, you better not drink the same amount of alcohol that you think you can drink. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It could be deadly. CHRIS PALMER: It could be deadly, and/or it could be really-- yeah, deadly to you or someone else because unfortunately, a lot of times when people drink, they get behind the wheel. And they think that they can handle two drinks safely. And they think, well, I can go out for dinner and have two glasses of wine and drive home safely. I know myself. If you go to a ketogenic diet, please don't drive with the same two drinks because it means your blood alcohol level-- if it models anything that we found in the rat study-- your blood alcohol levels may be five times higher than they would normally be. And that means you are really wasted. And you're probably not safe to be driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably the same is true for drinking on an empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now, it's a very important point. And thank you for raising that. I hear this again about mitochondria, about blood glucose, you mentioned astrocytes. And for those of you-- that earlier astrocytes are a non-neuron cell type in the brain, a glial cell type that my postdoc advisor was known for popularizing the modern science of glia, which include astrocytes. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that they are considered the cells that hold everything together in the brain and are kind of passive observers. But they do many things actively. I think now people appreciate the astrocytes at least as important as the neurons. And certainly, for disease, they are often implicated in warding off of disease, et cetera. Everything that you're telling me about the fact that the brain can regulate things that are happening in the body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, to me, as a neuroscientist, that's not surprising. All of it just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus, hypothalamus because here, you're telling me, it's regulating these basal functions like metabolism. It's regulating how much we crave things. And of course, hypothalamus is involved in motivation and craving. There are other areas, too-- other areas of the brain, too, of course. But I would imagine that someone ought to or has mapped out where the receptors for all this business are in the brain. And I guess that raises the question of, when one goes on a ketogenic or low blood glucose diet or fast, has anyone observed changes in the brain? Has anyone had neuroimaging of humans and their brains under conditions of ingesting one diet or another, whether or not they're psychiatric-- suffering from a psychiatric disorder or not? I would think that's where the gold is. CHRIS PALMER: We do have some of those studies. When you do a neuroimaging study, you can measure a lot of different things. So one thing with a PET scan, you can measure glucose metabolism. So a researcher, Stephen Cunnane is doing that research in particular in Alzheimer's disease patients and Alzheimer's disease models but in humans. And that's because we know that-- again, a common finding in patients with Alzheimer's disease is this glucose hypometabolism, some people are attributing it to insulin signaling impairment. And so some people are calling it type III diabetes. At the end of the day, I think the clearest signal that we have is that cells aren't getting enough energy from glucose as a fuel source. That is something that I think I can confidently say that's backed by numerous research studies. There's debate in the research field about whether that's a primary driver of the illness. I happen to believe it is. And if you ask the question, well, why would cells not be getting enough fuel from glucose? You have to focus on mitochondria because they're the ones producing the fuel from that glucose. So you somehow you have to implicate mitochondria in that process one way or another. Others will say, no, that's just a side effect of whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease. So Stephen Cunnane has done studies where he even gives ketone supplements. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone esters or ketone salts. And it has actually found that these brain metabolism deficits can be corrected, at least short-term, by giving a ketone supplement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is this in the context of people also ingesting some carbohydrate? Because I confess, I've tried the ketogenic diet. I probably did it wrong. This was years ago. And then the cyclic ketogenic diet. But in the last year or so, I've started using liquid ketone esters. And I do eat some carbohydrates each day, usually in proportion to how much high intensity exercise I'm doing. Those liquid ketone esters, for me-- at least subjectively-- I feel greatly increase my energy levels and my ability to focus mentally. And they improve my sleep. This is my observation tracking some data but just, again, subjectively. So in this example, are you talking about people taking ketone esters or ketone salts on a backdrop of a ketogenic diet or on the backdrop of a more typical diet? CHRIS PALMER: So he's done both. So he's done studies where patients aren't doing anything special with the diet. So they're eating whatever they normally eat, absolutely nonketogenic, giving them a ketone salt or ester, and then noticing immediate and direct changes in the metabolism of these metabolically compromised brain cells as measured by PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are not household pets, by the way. Sorry, I have-- we have to just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets. Although, I'm sure that there are people out there who have their dogs, or cats, or whatever, or their pet kangaroos, whatever you might own, on ketogenic diet. OK. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. So he's actually moved further. He's done a pilot trial in a nursing home actually, where he did not put the patients on a ketogenic diet. He simply reduced carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch. They still got the same dinner as everyone else. And simply reducing carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch resulted in cognitive improvement in a statistically significant way in some of those subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I love that result. I'm sorry, I just have to highlight this. I'm a huge believer in directing carbohydrates to specific portions of the day when one needs to be less focused and alert and yet can replenish glycogen. Limiting carbohydrates most of the time during the day, for me, has been a game changer in terms of maintaining alertness, et cetera. I'm not aware that I have age-related cognitive decline. But then again, I would-- people around me may argue otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let me say, you are Andrew Huberman. There is no way you have [LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although you didn't know me as a six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: If you have cognitive impairment, we're all screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have plenty of flaws and impairments-- well over 3,000 documented by people very close to me. But this is very interesting, I think, in the context of everything we've been talking about because could it be that supplementing with liquid ketones or prescribing liquid ketones to people who are challenged with mood disorders-- or things of that sort-- could be beneficial, even if they are not willing or able to adhere to a ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER: That is the million dollar question right now. And we don't have good trial data to say yes or no. My speculation, my hunch, having tried that clinically with patients, is it doesn't seem to work. It's not the same thing. The bigger reason for my feeling confident in saying that is that we've had ketone salts and esters available for over a decade now. We have tens of thousands of children and adolescents who are following a strict, ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet to control their epilepsy. Those kids would love to be off the ketogenic diet. Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER: There is not one case report of any child controlling his or her seizures using exogenous ketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least some of those people haven't tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. They have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones. Their symptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn't effective. Now, again, those are anecdotes. My scientific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is actually not necessarily about ketones themselves. Ketones are one of a multifaceted story there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they're also improving-- they're lowering glucose levels. They're improving insulin signaling. They're ramping up mitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make ketones. That's where they're made. And they're primarily made in the liver mitochondria. So when somebody is on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their liver mitochondria go through the roof because they're being called to action. It's like, hey, body's in starvation mode. Get to work. And so the mitochondria-- the cell senses we need more mitochondria to process fat to turn it into ketones so that those ketones can get up to the brain and keep the brain fueled, because fatty acids can't fuel the brain. Only ketones can. Now, so my sense is that-- and the gut microbiome changes and everything, the changes in hormones-- so if you're eating a lot of donuts and drinking a bottle of ketones, the donuts are going to prevent your body from lowering glucose levels. You're still going to have the high glucose levels from the donuts. You're still going to probably have the impaired insulin signaling. You're probably still going to possibly have some inflammation from the inflammatory effects of that food. And so just drinking ketones alone won't be enough. I think for people who are metabolically healthy, I'll include you in that, I think ketones can play a really beneficial role, no doubt. I think exogenous ketones may, in fact, proven valuable in clinical use for patients who maybe can't follow a super strict ketogenic diet but maybe could do a low carb diet. And then given the research that's happening with alcohol use disorder, I could imagine a situation-- here's the million dollar tip to whoever wants to go out and get this, if it actually turns out to be true. I could imagine a scenario where we use exogenous ketones with alcoholics. And that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol, they drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort of tastes like alcohol. The ketone esters, when I take them, I drink them straight. Sometimes I'll put them in seltzer. And I'm not a big drinker, as I mentioned. I might have an alcoholic drink every once in a while. I just don't ever crave it. I just do it every maybe-- I think 2020 was the last time I had a drink of alcohol. So obviously, I'm not a good representative example. But the ketones taste good to me. And they obviously don't get you drunk. They do seem to flick on my alertness pretty quickly. My understanding is that they are the brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning, they are going to be the first fuels used by the brain when there's a buffet of fuels available. If there's glucose in my bloodstream, there's circulating liquid ketones, the ketones would be used first or preferentially. Is that true? CHRIS PALMER: I think it's a complex question. Some research that we have suggest that there are brain areas or brain cells that require glucose and cannot use ketones. So 100% of the brain cannot be fueled with ketones as far as we can tell. So there are some areas that require glucose. And that's probably the reason we have gluconeogenesis to keep the body going and keep the brain going no matter what. But when ketones are available, especially if ketones are high, the way I think about it is not that ketones are the preferred fuel source and glucose goes to the wayside. But the way I think about it is that you have a range of cells with varying degrees of metabolic health. And some of those cells are going to be extraordinarily healthy with appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. And those cells are probably going to continue to use glucose as a fuel source. But if ketones happen to be there, sure, they'll use that, too. Why not? But the real money is metabolically compromised tissues, whether it's brain cells or other tissues that-- we're talking about the brain. So if you've got metabolically compromised brain cells-- because it's not across the board. Like with Alzheimer's brain scans, there are specific regions that are more metabolically compromised than others. And that's why we see patterns of atrophy in specific brain regions. It's because those regions are dysfunctional metabolically for whatever reason. And we can get into why that might be. But my sense is that if you've got a metabolically compromised cell, that cell is sending out a distress signal. That cell is calling resources from the body, like feed me. Give me something. And if it can't use glucose effectively, it is going to suck up those ketones and then start running on all cylinders or closer to it. And that process is so critical because what it means is that if that cell was barely getting by on 60% of its real ATP requirement, it means that it doesn't have enough energy for maintenance and repair functions. As soon as you give that cell a hundred percent energy or close to it, even if you get it up to 90% of its preferred energy amount, it can start to repair itself. That's the beauty of the human body in living organisms, is that they have a priority list of what they're going to do. If that cell senses that there are defective molecules, defective proteins in this cell that need to be replaced, once it gets enough fuel, it will start repairing itself and doing that work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That makes sense. Thank you for that clarification. I'd like to talk about Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline generally. I know many people out there are just terrified of losing their memory for the obvious reasons. Memory sets context, et cetera. And many people have relatives that suffer from Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. I've heard that the ketogenic diet and diets like it can be very effective for helping to offset some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline. In fact, I even have a friend I won't out by institution, who's the chair of Cardiology, who contacted me, of all people, asking whether or not I was aware of any studies or whether or not I knew of anybody who had benefited from ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's. And I thought, well, why don't you ask one of your colleagues in neurology? But his response was really interesting. He said there are many books out there for the general public. There are a lot of online discussions about this. There are a lot of assertions about this, and some animal studies. Again, these are his words. There are very few, if any, controlled clinical trials exploring the role of the ketogenic diet for the treatment or reversal of Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline. I'm hoping that statement was incorrect or soon will be incorrect-- because those trials are ongoing-- but he said, yeah, the people are most popular for telling us about the important role and positive role of being in ketosis for Alzheimer's, for some reason, they just won't do a clinical trial. And that's been frustrating to the community. So this is a very educated, very accomplished person who's a physician of heart medicine as opposed to something else related to the brain. But what is the story there. And for goodness' sake, why aren't there clinical trials on ketogenic diet and Alzheimer's? I don't expect you to be responsible for that fact. But goodness, I would think this would be the obvious thing for NIH. I'm on study section but not for these sorts of experiments. Why isn't money just avalanching into this area based on all the anecdotal evidence that people are talking about? CHRIS PALMER: So we've got a couple of small pilot clinical trials. The best one was a randomized controlled trial. I think it only included 26 subjects, something like that, randomized to 12 weeks of a low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks of ketogenic diet. Some of the participants got keto first and then low fat. Other participants got low fat then keto. And that trial actually found that when patients were in ketosis, they had statistically significant improvement in activities of daily living and quality of life. And they did have improvement in cognitive function. But it didn't reach statistical significance, that improvement did not. We've got other trials. We've got several animal models showing that the ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in Alzheimer's models. So it can reduce plaques and tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment in animal models. And we've got a couple of other small pilot trials of ketogenic diet in humans, showing that it improves biomarkers compared to, say, the low fat diet or the American Heart Association diet. So we've got those. I think one of the biggest challenges that I'll just share openly-- and this is-- I'm somebody who's pretty passionate about this research. And I believe it has a lot of potential. But Johns Hopkins' researchers attempted to do exactly this kind of a study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic diet versus the, I think, American Academy of Aging-- or something like that-- diet, is the controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which presumably has starches in there. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's the key variable. CHRIS PALMER: Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And some potatoes-- CHRIS PALMER: Whole grains, lots of whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, some potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: And they spent, I believe, over three years. They screened over 1,300 people who expressed interest. At the end of the day, I think they only got 27 people to enroll. And only 14 of those people completed the study. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, what they found was that the subjects who achieved ketosis had cognitive improvement. But people on study section are going to look at a study like that and say, even if the science is there, if you can't get people to do this diet, why would we spend money on researchers trying to get people to do this diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I should mention, study section is this closed door panels of 40 or so people. There are many of these panels. Different divisions in the National Institutes of Health use different panels. And then grants are evaluated in a very small, because of the size of the federal budget for research, a very small percentage. Usually, about 10% of these studies are funded. The rest generally don't end up happening. That is very informative. What you just described is very informative because now it makes sense to me. There's no conspiracy. It's not big pharma, I don't think, is trying to suppress trials of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer's because I would imagine the first thing that pharma would want to do is to see that study done. So they didn't have to. And then the moment it was done, if it showed a positive effect, they'd probably want to isolate the molecule and wrap it up in something that people would take, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I don't think there's any active suppression by pharma. I think pharma would probably be cheering from the sidelines because they could capitalize on it, because ultimately, the studies are done by scientists. But the treatments are generally doled out by pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians. So I don't believe there's a conspiracy there. That is very interesting. And it's kind of amazing, given our discussion of earlier, which is that you had a patient that was having schizophrenic symptoms who managed to stay on this diet. So is there something special about Alzheimer's patients and people with age-related cognitive decline? Presumably, they're very dependent on others to cook for them and shop for them. I think that this is almost perfect controlled environment for getting this study done. CHRIS PALMER: I think that is the key issue. So again, I got patients-- I get patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people to do this diet and stay with it. But it's because I'm providing a weekly session for them. And I imagine this study did not provide that kind of intensive support. In the pilot trial that I described to you, they actually got, I think, over 90% compliance with the different dietary interventions. So some of it is going to be dependent on the research group. And does the research group understand that this is not-- it's not like prescribing a pill. Here, take this pill. And take it every day and come back in three weeks. And even then, we don't know for sure that the patient took the pill every day. We just assume they took the pill every day. And studies say they probably didn't. So I think when we think about a dietary intervention, we need to think about more intensive support and education. And that support could be a health and wellness coach. It could be a dietician. It could be education of the family. It might even be providing them with dietary meals. That maybe for six months, we actually provide them with ketogenic meals-- once a week, put them in your freezer. Microwave them when needed-- to make this diet as easy and doable as possible. Because if we can get people to do the diet, if we can get them through the first couple of months, most people can learn how to do this diet. More importantly-- I didn't mention this before. But the number one reason I am so successful at getting patients to stay on this diet for years, is because of the consequences to them when they go off of it. That is the reason I can get schizophrenic patients and bipolar patients to do this diet, whereas other people can't get an everyday human being to do it for weight loss because the weight loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms when they break the diet. Oftentimes, they are rewarded. They eat something they really enjoy. And they get a little bit of a dopamine rush from it. And they're off to the races. They're like, I'm going to-- oh, I've already cheated. I'll cheat again. I'll get back on it someday. And they never get around to it. My patients, when they go off the diet, they start hallucinating within 48-- or 24, 48 hours. And they quickly realize that was a really stupid thing to do. That piece of cake was not at all worth the torment that I'm experiencing now. So they get back on the diet. I suspect with Alzheimer's disease, we might notice something similar. Some of these people have very mild symptoms. So maybe they won't have that kind of a reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind of experience. But I think some of them will. Some of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively. And if this diet could help them remember better, if this diet could help them function better-- and again, that's what the pilot trial showed, is activities of daily living. That means these people are able to go to the bathroom on their own. They're able to get themselves dressed. Whereas, they needed help with those things before. Those are actually really important things to both the patient and the caregiver. And if they go off the diet and then quickly revert into a more symptomatic state, that might be reinforcing enough for them to figure out a way to do the diet on their own. And if we think about, if this really is an effective intervention-- and yes, we need longer trials, larger trials, all of that, because there are plenty of stories in the medical field where pilot trials looked really spectacular and promising. And then larger trials just failed to show the benefits. I believe, based on all the science of metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, all of that, I believe the science makes this an obvious treatment that has real potential. So people will call me biased. That's fine. I've got my bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based on clinical observation and extensive clinical observation at that-- I think biases that are simply because we want to feel a certain way or believe something are worth critiquing. But bias based on observation-- here, I should mention that most of what we know about human memory was sparked by one patient, a famous HM, who I think was living in Harvard Medical, in one of the hospitals around. There are many hospitals on Longwood Campus. But one patient, the reason we associate the hippocampus with memory is because we knew that HM's the hippocampus was intentionally damaged for epilepsy treatment. So this idea that everything has to be a randomized clinical trial, to me, is crazy. Of course, that's a gold standard. And it's essential. But there's so much information in textbooks, medical textbooks in particular, that are gleaned from single-patient case studies or from three-patient neurostimulation in the brain or something of that sort. So to me, I'm still perplexed as to why there's this insistence on only one form of evidence. Clearly, what you're doing, the important work that you're doing clinically, and in the research side, and in public communication, is assisting this. I have a question about-- or more of a statement/question about the ketogenic diet. Based on everything that we've talked about, seems to me that the ketogenic diet for weight loss is a very interesting aspect of the diet as is intermittent fasting for weight loss even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction that occurs with fasting. But then in some ways, the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight loss are a bit of a decoy for most people. That's where their mind goes. This person lost X amount of weight. Maybe that made them feel better. Maybe that actually made them underweight. I think you've talked about it. For some people, it can actually bring them under weight. I'm glad that we got the chance to dive into the description of ketogenic diet for epilepsy because it really is a medical intervention that has a side effect of weight loss or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss. But it's really about far more than that. And that raises a question for me, which is-- we've been talking about the ketogenic diet as one thing. But I've heard you discuss this before, where just as a physician will prescribe different dosage ranges of a given drug, you can prescribe different dosage ranges of a nutritional plan, a diet. It's not one thing. It's not necessarily zero carbohydrates or 100 grams or 50 grams. It depends on the patient and a lot of other factors. I've heard you list off various things classic keto. Maybe you could just briefly tell us what that typically is, because I think most people think it means eating a lot of meat and not carbohydrates. But it might not be that. Fasting and then some of the other-- you mentioned Atkins earlier. We don't have to go into each of these in detail. And I know in your book, you talk about not just the science and clinical background but also some actionable steps that people could consider. So they can refer there for more detail. But for somebody who, let's say, is depressed-- they've had some rounds of depression. Maybe they're on antidepressants, maybe not-- and they want to try something like this. Obviously, this has to be done in concert with a physician observing all this. But what is the typical thing that you probe with first? Just like with a drug, you might probe with 20 milligrams of a drug. What's your typical initial dietary intervention probe? Terrible languaging, I realize. And I'm criticizing myself for that. But I think people get the idea. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is that I don't have a one-size-fits-all recommendation for any person. So the first thing that I'm going to assess with the patient is, what symptoms are they having? What is their current diet like? And what are they willing to do? I try to meet them where they're at. So if somebody-- and I want to point out. You mentioned the all-meat version of this diet, which is often referred to as the carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER: There is no doubt that exists. Some people swear by it. They swear they've tried other versions of ketogenic diets and only when they went to a carnivore diet did they get benefits. But there are vegetarian and vegan versions of the ketogenic diet. So in my mind, this is not at all about the diet wars of animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods. It's about inducing a state of ketosis, which is mimicking the fasting state. That is what it's about. And you can do that by not eating anything, by fasting and/or intermittent fasting. And you get your results. So no diet is a ketogenic diet. So it's not about the foods or the types of foods that you're eating. It's about inducing a state of ketosis. The first variable I'm going to look at when I recommend this or prescribe this is the person's current weight. If somebody is obese versus somebody who's thin, I'm going to use different dietary strategies for those two situations. In the obese patient, they have tons of fat stores on their body already. Usually, it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those. And they'd like to lose some weight if they're going to try a ketogenic diet for brain health anyway. And so I'm going to use that. So that person, really, the diet is carbohydrate restriction. And that usually is a sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Both simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars and fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose, definitely. So no added sugars, essentially. You can have added natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit. You might use artificial sweeteners. Years of doing this, I'd probably recommend steer away from them if you can because I think they tend to stimulate cravings for high carb foods. So if you can kind of get through a couple of weeks without sweet things, your cravings for those will go down. And it'll make the diet easier and a little more sustainable. But let's say you can have your artificial sweeteners, if that's what you really want. So I'm going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day for those people. They can have all the protein they want. They can have vegetables. And they can have all the fat they want. But I'm not going to push fat on those people. I'm not going to tell them, eat a lot of fat, at the same time because I want to use the fat on their body as the fat source, at least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you encouraging healthy fats like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? Are you encouraging people to eat a little less butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: I tend to encourage, again, a wide range of fats. And it's going to depend on the person. A lot of times, people come to me with very specific ideas. But I'm going to tend to encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, which are usually considered, even by the American Heart Association, healthy sources of fat. The more controversial thing are things like coconut oil or coconut cream, which the American Heart Association might say is not a healthy fat, I kind of disagree with that and don't think it's unhealthy at all actually. And when you look at the epidemiological studies of saturated fat causing heart disease or causing adverse outcomes, at best, maybe increases your risk 10% to 15%-- at best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How much coconut oil can people ingest, anyway, before they either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- or just sort of get tired of coconut oil? Anyway, your point is taken. But they can eat meat if they like meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or they can eat eggs. Or if they don't like meat and eggs, they could eat sardines or things of that sort. I personally can't-- I can't even stomach the-- I don't even like the word "sardine." I have nothing against the actual fish. But that's just me. But obviously, people have-- I say this because people have different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll eat a steak. But I'm not going to eat a sardine. CHRIS PALMER: And I'm going to go with that. And again, there are vegan sources of protein that-- people can eat tempeh and other things. So that's the obese person. It's carb restriction as the primary initial phase. The thin person is going to need to eat a lot of fat because they don't have a lot of fat stores on their body. And if I want them in ketosis, clinical ketosis, I'm going to have to feed them fat. So that's the person that I'm going to say, make sure you get in avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. So heavy cream is delicious. It's a delicious way to get your fats in. I have one patient who just drinks it straight, to just try to get it in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it. I've never had an appetite for sweets. I absolutely love savory fatty food. When I was in high school, I was thin. So I was able to do this. But I used to drink half-and-half. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and drink it just because it tastes so, so good. CHRIS PALMER: It does taste good. So if they're on a ketogenic diet, I'm going to push them away from half-and-half and toward heavy whipping cream. So you can whip that up. You can freeze it. It turns into ice cream. You can add vanilla. You can add cocoa powder. You can add all sorts of things. And you're off to the races with shakes, and ice cream, and mousse, and all sorts of things that you can have. With any of these patients, the beauty of this diet is I have objective biomarkers. I'm going to have them measuring ketones. And I'm going to adjust the diet based on their state of ketosis and/or the clinical benefits that I'm looking for. If it's an average person, who is not currently under psychiatric care, not taking prescription medicines but is saying, I'm burned out. I'm exhausted. I want some of that brain energy that Andrew Huberman is talking about. He talks about feeling good. I want some of that. I'm probably actually going to recommend the protocol you describe, which is, let's see if we can just carb restrict for a while and see if that produces clinical benefit. I have one-- he's not even a patient, just somebody who read my book. I didn't tell him anything. And he came away from it saying-- he was ready to start an antidepressant for his anxiety. He had chronic anxiety, was trying meditation, was trying all sorts of things. Nothing-- those things weren't enough. He was ready to go on prescription medicine. He read an early copy of the book. He took it upon himself without consulting with me to restrict carbohydrates alone. He did not go ketogenic. He is a vegetarian. He restricted carbs. Within three weeks, said, I don't need prescription medicine. I can't believe how much better I feel. And all I did was cut out some of the high carb foods in my diet. So I think for some people, it can be that simple. For people with serious mental disorders, if they are chronically depressed, if they're on lots of prescription meds, if they're disabled by their symptoms, and certainly, if you're bipolar or have schizophrenia or something, those are the people I really do want them to work with a medical professional because meds may need to be adjusted. They need a real shot at this diet. It's not like weight loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. And either you're successful or you aren't. You look on the internet or you read a book or you do-- even the colleague that you mentioned, he's probably just reading-- who knows whether it's credible information or not-- and just winging it, and seeing whether it works or not. For people with serious mental disorders, I want you to treat it like you have epilepsy because you do have a serious brain disorder. It's impairing your ability to function in the world. It's impairing your health and happiness. You deserve a competent medical treatment. And we have that. We have a hundred-year evidence-based. We've got dieticians who know this like the back of their hand. They can monitor your level of ketosis. They can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies that can be a consequence of the diet, and make sure that you're not developing those. They can help tweak the diet if needed. They can give you ideas if you're getting bored with eggs every morning. They can give you ideas for what else you might have. And if you're using it to treat a serious disorder, I think you need serious help. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A couple of questions, a little more detailed, but I think a lot of people will have this on their mind. Is it ever the case that you'll prescribe somebody the ketogenic diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting? So eat keto but eat between the hours of, whatever, 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM or something like that. That's the first question. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. And I have one patient with type 2 diabetes and chronic depression. And he will try to follow the ketogenic diet. And sometimes, his blood sugars are still very high. And sometimes I will ask him to do either intermittent fasting or even a three or four day water fast. And it is shocking. When he does a three or four day water fast, the first day or two, he feels like crap. I'll just say up front, don't do it if you've got an important meeting or business trip or anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this is just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: This is just consuming water. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: I usually tell him he can have plain black coffee or tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You have mercy after all. CHRIS PALMER: I have a tiny ounce of mercy. But when he does it, his blood sugars plummet in a good way, his blood sugars are normalizing. But the last time he did it, he actually got to seven days at one point. And he said, I feel great. I want to keep going. I can't believe that I'm not hungry. But I am not hungry at all. I don't miss food at all. And at seven days, I kind of cut the cord. I was like, no, no. We're done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He needs to eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] We're done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You got to eat. Well, I find it really interesting that the intermittent fasting, of course, controversial at some level, but as to whether or not it's just beneficial by way of caloric restriction-- because it is one way to achieve caloric restriction-- whether or not has additional benefits. But I'm very interested in the neural side of it. And it does seem that the fasted state can start to take on its own rewarding properties, where people get dopamine release not from eating, as most everyone does, but from abstaining from food. Now, this can be pathologic in the sort of example of anorexia nervosa, which is we both know as the most deadly psychiatric illness. But for non-anoxerics, I think it's interesting to note that eventually not eating can have its own rewarding properties to it that aren't just related to weight loss. But in the short-term, feeling-- in other words, feeling really good by way of abstaining from eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. And that's actually-- it raises an important risk that I haven't mentioned yet. But at least in psychiatric patients-- but even in some patients who just use the keto diet for weight loss, I have seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are people that aren't sleeping very much. Are they also getting kind of delusional, thinking they're going to run for president? CHRIS PALMER: No. So the distinction between hypomania and mania-- so mania, you might become psychotic and delusional. Mania, by definition, is problematic. It's causing a problem in some way or another. And if you have psychotic symptoms, it's definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, for better or worse, is something every human being probably craves. So it is feeling extraordinarily good. It's getting by on less sleep. But you don't need to sleep. Who needs sleep? I've got things to do. My brain is running on all cylinders. I feel so creative. There have been lots of famous people through the ages who have been bipolar, probably bipolar. And some of their most productive periods of time, whether it's art or creating scientific models or what-have-you, were probably during hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what do you do in that case? I'm obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep. It's a kind of a repeating theme in our podcast and many of my social media posts. And I always recommend behavioral tools first, then exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera, at appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, and occasionally, for people who are doing all that and still struggle with sleep, supplementation. One of the things that I've seen some data on is that for people who are following a low carbohydrate diet, that inositol, in particular, can be helpful for getting into sleep probably because it's a bit of an-- has a bit of an anti-anxiety effect. But presumably, there are other things out there, too. The magnesiums will generally do that. A hot bath will do that, too, for that matter. But what you're talking about is people who are going, what, a day and a half without sleep? Or they're just two hours of sleep a night? CHRIS PALMER: So the worst case I saw was actually a mental health professional who didn't recognize it initially. He went six months with two to four hours of sleep every night. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they were on a ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER: He was on a ketogenic diet, was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night, did not initially recognize that this was a problem. He was feeling great. He was feeling that keto high. And he was actually waking up at 4:00 AM, going for 10 to 20 mile runs most days. He finally stopped the ketogenic diet after about six months because he said, I can't maintain my weight. I'm losing too much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just thinking there are some social media personalities associated with nutrition that might be hypomanic. I'll let you do the clinical evaluation. So what does somebody do in that case? So I don't know that I've ever been hypomanic. But as I mentioned earlier, unless I've done a very high intensity workout early in the day and I need to replenish carbohydrates, I typically eat meat, fruit, and vegetables throughout the day-- minimum amounts of fruit but some. And then at night, I switch over to mainly carbohydrate. It really helps me sleep. It replenishes glycogen stores. I sleep really well, wake up the next morning, repeat. And of course, this goes against a lot of the dogma that, oh, you're not supposed to eat carbohydrates late in the day and [MUMBLES]. This is what works for me. And so I do it. For somebody like this mental health professional, who is hypomanic, would going off the ketogenic diet entirely be the best idea? Or could it be that adjusting when they eat their carbohydrates would be advantageous in order to make sure that they felt alert and great during the day? Maybe not hypomanic but then could have a four to eight-hour a night sleep as opposed to a two to four hours a night, which is really very little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It can't be healthy. CHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you can do it and feel great, I imagine that the brain is suffering. CHRIS PALMER: It is. And the body is suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And your friends and family are suffering. CHRIS PALMER: The body is repairing itself with sleep. And so yeah, it's-- if it's somebody who is not a patient, they're not a mental health patient. They're not using the ketogenic diet as a mental health treatment. They're simply doing it for whatever. I actually start with everything you've just outlined. Let's start with behavioral measures first. And the first intervention is education. You need at least six hours of sleep a night. Period, end of story. That's non-negotiable. If you're not getting at least six hours of sleep a night, we need to consider this a problem. So figure out a way to get 6 hours of sleep. For some people, that's enough, just the education. They don't get out of bed at 3:00 AM. It might take them an hour to fall back to sleep. They fall back to sleep. For most people, if you can get three nights of decent sleep in a row, the hypomania goes away. That is the way to extinguish it. And then they still go on feeling a high from it. They feel great. Their brain feels good in terms of memory, concentration, motivation, all of those things. But they're not hypomanic anymore. And then I might use supplements, melatonin, others that you mentioned, magnesium is a big one. And for some, I will recommend exactly what you're doing-- eat some carbohydrates in the evening before you're going to bed. Either have them at dinner and then wait a few hours before you're going to go to bed or have them right before you're going to go to bed, just to try to calm your body down and get it going. When I'm using this as a clinical intervention, especially with patients with serious mental illness, I actually want them in a state of ketosis long-term. So I'm not going to do the carbohydrate intervention. I'm going to try all the other ones. But if they still can't sleep even with supplements, over the counter supplements, then I'm probably going to go with prescription, sleeping medicines, as a temporary stopgap to try to get them three to seven days of decent sleep. That usually breaks the hypomanic cycle. And then they stay on the ketogenic diet because it ends up resulting in all of these other improvements that I've described. Their illness can sometimes go in to full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it low dose trazodone as a first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: I would not use trazodone. I would actually specifically avoid trazodone because it's an antidepressant. And they're already hypomanic. And I certainly don't want to push that further. So as long as it's somebody without a history of addiction, I'm going to use a benzodiazepine or either commonly called the Z medicines for sleep-- zolpidem or Ambien or something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those tap into the opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS PALMER: GABA. I usually start with something like Ativan or Klonopin or something like that-- probably Ativan because it's shorter-acting. And again, I'm only looking to use it short-term. I let them know that up front. We're looking for three to seven days of decent sleep. And then we're going to try to get them off that medicine. And usually, people are off to the races and can sustain it well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A question about hormones. Many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask-- any time we're talking about something like exercise or a drug treatment or behavioral training, people will say, what about the menstrual cycle? How is that impacted by this? How does the menstrual cycle impact its efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates and caloric restriction have been implicated in different interactions-- are known to interact with the endocrine system. So what do you do if you have a patient who is depressed or could have psychotic symptoms-- but let's go with depression because that's probably a bit more familiar to most people-- and then they're on a low carbohydrate or full ketogenic diet, but their menstrual cycles cease. How do you deal with those adjustments? And I guess we could expand this conversation and say, what about male fertility also? Because some caloric diets seem to-- my understanding is that submaintenance caloric diets, so weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios in males that are obese. But for someone that's not obese, to go on a sub-caloric diet, that it can start to impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render them infertile but certainly adjust that whole axis. So what about interactions between ketosis, diets, et cetera, and the endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is, I don't think anybody knows. And there's not a one-size-fits-all answer because I've seen examples. And I'm aware of science to back up polar opposite conclusions. So the first general observation that I'll make-- I know so many couples, husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, heterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I'm just kidding. [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easier time with it than the women. It's not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women say I couldn't tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel worse. And I think in those cases, it probably does relate to hormones. I'm aware of animal models, of mice-- in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher shared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on the ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard diet were just having babies right and left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The ketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should not be fasting. If your body is in a fasting state, it probably does not want to expend resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby because your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" or starvation. That even though the ketogenic diet is a sustainable, nonstarvation diet, we're really using that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And so just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women's bodies may actually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a woman should not be having a baby when she's starving to death. I know of examples of women who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and tremendously from the ketogenic diet, have put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full remission. And I do actually know of one case, at least one case. A woman, infertile, she and her husband had been trying for three years, no pregnancy. She went keto. Within four months, she was pregnant. How do I make sense of that? I don't know. And unfortunately, I don't think we really have good control data on what does the ketogenic diet do to male hormonal systems, what does the ketogenic diet do to female hormonal systems. But clearly, I think changes are happening. I don't have a way to predict it, at least. If somebody else has great insights, I welcome them. But I haven't seen them published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a terrific answer because when things are all over the place and bidirectional, depending on one circumstance or the other, I think it screams for controlled studies, and more descriptions of case studies, and anecdotal data, too. So I think it's an excellent answer. It also calls to mind the important public service announcement that because of these bidirectional effects that you described, please don't use fasting or the ketogenic diet as a reliable form of contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please don't. I have a final question, which relates to something that is very much starting to get buzz now-- and maybe more so for people that hang out in the Twitter space or the nutrition space. But there's a new class of drugs that I think initially were developed to treat diabetes but are now being evaluated for their efficacy to treat obesity. And these are the semaglutide drugs that are involved in-- they tap into these glucagon related GLP-1 pathways. And it is a story that we've talked about a little bit on the podcast before. But many people, I imagine, probably haven't heard that conversation. I would simply like to know what you think about these drugs. They obviously adjust the way that glucose and insulin are managing energy, both in the body and the brain, and can produce weight loss. So that to me, when I look at the data, it's impressive. But a good logical shift in diet and exercise could achieve similar weight loss. But a lot of people just won't do that. So the question I have is, what are your thoughts on semaglutide and other GLP-- I think I might have said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related compounds? And do you ever prescribe these in conjunction with these dietary shifts? Because it seems to me, they would fall right in with the catalog of other approaches that you have available. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is, I am not at all an expert on these medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what are your thoughts about them? They seem to be weight loss drugs, not unlike the fen-phen drugs of the '90s that then were banned because a few people didn't handle them well. CHRIS PALMER: They are. We had fen-phen. And even before that, in the 1950s, and '60s, and '70s, Dexedrine-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, was the treatment of choice for women across the United States to keep their slim figures. And we created addicts and all sorts of problems. But they were widely used and probably millions of women because they work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they kill appetite. CHRIS PALMER: They kill appetite. My overall thoughts are this. There is zero doubt in my mind that the obesity epidemic is a threat to human health and potentially the human species. If it keeps going at the rate it's going, it is a threat to our species. We have to figure out what on Earth is happening, and what can we do about it. These medications, in early studies, are highly effective over a year or two. That's promising. I am worried, though, that we're not attacking the root cause of obesity. If the root cause of obesity ends up being some kind of poisoning of the metabolic machinery in the brain or body-- and I would argue that probably relates to mitochondrial health and mitochondrial function-- I have every reason to believe that taking a medication that helps you lose weight may not be addressing that problem. And therefore, may not be addressing all of the negative health consequences of what we call obesity. So obesity, in it of itself, we know that excess fat can become inflammatory and can cause problems, in and of itself. But I actually see obesity as a symptom. I see obesity as a symptom of metabolic derangement in the body or brain. And that is why people become obese. And that if we're really going to get anywhere, we need to identify what is causing that metabolic derangement. Using a symptomatic treatment like a GLP-1 medication, to the best of my knowledge, is not addressing that core problem. And we're just ignoring it. Maybe I'll be wrong. And maybe these will be the wonder drug that saved the human species, and everybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever. I'm not hopeful, because we've never-- we've had so many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine, and other things, we've had so many promising drugs. And at the end of the day, when you try to muck with human metabolism using a single processed molecule, manmade, I can't think of even one example where it's been great for large numbers of people. Certainly, manufacturing insulin is life-saving for people with type 1 diabetes. So that would be an example. But giving massive doses of insulin to people with type 2 diabetes, actually is a downward spiral. I would much rather see people with type 2 diabetes control their diabetes through diet and lifestyle. And that might be a ketogenic diet, or a low carb diet, or exercise or good sleep, or all of the other thing. All of it. I'd much rather see that because when people try to control their type 2 diabetes with a molecule, even though it's a natural molecule insulin, we know that thats results in really poor health consequences, results in higher rates of cardiovascular disease, higher rates of mental disorders, higher rates of premature mortality. Do I think GLP-1 molecules are going to be different? No. I don't have any reason to think they are going to be. So that would be my two cents, but we'll see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will tell. Meanwhile, I want to thank you for doing what is, without question, pioneering work. Again, I'm not a clinician. But I've been around this space long enough to know that indeed there there are no wonder drugs. There are drugs that certainly can help alleviate symptoms in some individuals. But that lifestyle and in the case of your work-- in particular, in the discussion today-- diet and, the ketogenic diet, in particular, it's clear, can have incredible effects, miraculous effects, in some individuals. And positive effects in others that might not be of the same magnitude but nonetheless are extremely important, so on behalf of myself, and the listeners, and and certainly, just on behalf of everybody out there-- because everyone does need to be concerned about mental health issues, whether or not they have them and in their family themselves. Or otherwise, because they impact everybody. Just really want to thank you for viewing the work that you're doing because it really is pioneering. And it's brave. And I can see now, based on our discussion, why it would work. You've given us a lot of hints into the underlying mechanisms that suggest as to why it would work. And you're going to given us examples as to how it has worked in patients that you've worked with. And this field is expanding fast. I think this is an area of psychiatry and medicine in general. Meaning, behavioral, nutritional interventions, that is expanding very fast. So thank you for being brave and for taking this on, and doing it in such a structured way, and for communicating it here today. And with the general public, through your book, and your online presence. We will certainly point people in the direction of those valuable resources. Thanks so much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, I know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, for being brave and having me on your [LAUGHS] show-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a pleasure. CHRIS PALMER: --and for a great conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer. I hope you found it to be as informative, actionable, and exciting in terms of the various treatments that we can now think about when considering treatments for psychiatric disorders.

Title: Science-Based Tools for Increasing Happiness | Huberman Lab Podcast #98
Published: 2022-11-14 13:00:14 UTC
Description:
I explain the science of happiness, including the different types of happiness and how our actions, circumstances and mindset control them. While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate “natural happiness,” including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called “synthetic happiness”). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing happiness. We're going to discuss the science of happiness, because indeed, there are excellent laboratories that have worked for many decades to try and understand what is this thing that we call happiness and what brings us happiness in the short and long term. In fact, we could probably point to happiness as one of the most sought-after states or commodities, or emotions. Whatever you want to call it, happiness is what many people are seeking in work, in relationships, and in general. And yet most of us can't really define exactly what happiness is or means for us. We can point to certain experiences, we can try and describe our states of mind and body, but most people recognize the feeling when we have it, and we certainly recognize the feeling of not being happy. Whether or not that means simply not being happy as the absence of happiness or all-out depression. Now one of the key problems in trying to understand happiness and, indeed, the science and psychology of happiness is that it does indeed involve other similar things. Things like joy, and gratitude, and meaning. And indeed, many scientists and psychologists have argued for many, many decades about what happiness really is. Now we can come up with so-called operational definitions of happiness. Operational definitions are basically agreed-upon terms or agreed-upon definitions and conditions that will define something such as happiness. Much in the same way that we can all probably come up with an operational definition of milk. But of course, milk can be cow's milk, it can be oat milk, it can be soy milk, et cetera, et cetera. So too, something like happiness can be micro-divided and sliced and diced into as many things as we decide. Today we are really going to focus on three main things. First, we are going to define happiness as a brain state and as a state of mind and body. We're going to take a look at what the science says about all of that. Second, we are going to talk about tools and practices for placing ourselves into states of happiness. And while for most of us, we think of happiness as something that only arrives through the acquisition of some goal or some thing external to us, and of course, that is true. There is also something called synthetic happiness or synthesized happiness which turns out to be at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful. Now I'll just say right off the bat that I'm not going to tell you that all you have to do is sit in a chair and imagine being happy in order to feel happy. Synthesize happiness actually involves some very concrete steps that have been defined by excellent labs in psychology, so we're going to talk about synthesize happiness as it relates to what you can do to obtain happy states more readily or more frequently. And then, third, we're going to talk about some of the misconceptions or what I would call the contradictions of happiness research. And what I mean by that is most of you have probably heard about the general conditions for obtaining happiness. And they always seem to circle back to some of the same basic features of get great sleep, have great social connection, pursue meaning, don't focus to any overextend on things like pursuing money because there are indeed these studies that show that the amount of money that people make does not necessarily scale directly with happiness. We'll talk about those studies in some detail a little bit later. And while all of that literature is very powerful and informative, there is what I see as a contradiction. Which is for instance, that for many of us, including myself, especially in the years when I was in graduate school and a postdoc, there were times in which pursuing and being involved in work and pursuing degrees and finding meaning in my vocation actually separated me from the opportunity to have quite as many social connections, or quite as much sleep, or quite as much exercise, or even quite as much sunshine, for that matter. So all of the things that we're told that we need in order to access happiness on a regular basis oftentimes contradict with the pressures and the requirements of not just daily life but in building a life that allows us to have the kind of resources that we need in order to have things like quality social connection, and the time and opportunity to get regular exercise and great nutrition, et cetera, et cetera. So, again, while this isn't necessarily a complaint with any of the research out of the fields of psychology on happiness, it is important that we acknowledge these contradictions that exist in the discussion around happiness. In particular, the popular discussions around the science of happiness. So today, what we are going to arrive at, what you will finish this episode, with is a set of tools and a framework for understanding the pursuit of happiness in the short and long-term as it relates to the research from psychology but also the neuroscience. And my goal today is really to try and place that all into a structured framework so that you can know where you are in your journey or the landscape around happiness in your pursuit of happiness. And what I won't tell you is that you need to abandon all goals in terms of pursuing money, career, et cetera, and simply focus on relationships. But we will talk about what constitutes an excellent social bond or even in excellent conversation. There's excellent research that points to the fact that even rather shallow connections, that is, connections between people that you happen to just see in the hallway on a regular basis, not even requiring close bonds of any kind, can be built into close bonds that can deliver a tremendous amount of feeling and genuine social connection provided certain conditions are met. So today, again, it's really about understanding the science of happiness, understanding the mechanisms underlying what we call happiness. And providing you a framework by which you can pursue and achieve happiness not just as a long-term goal and not just as a day-to-day goal of little micro exercises of gratitude, et cetera, but rather as a way to think about happiness as a state that you have control over, at least in terms of your ability to access what I would call the algorithms that enable us or open the opportunity to experience happiness. Now before we begin today's episode, I'd like to talk about a very specific tool that applies yes to our pursuit of happiness but actually to our pursuit of everything, including quality sleep and ongoing motivation, et cetera. I've talked many, many times before on this podcast and on other podcasts, and on social media about the critical value of getting regular bright light, ideally sunlight, in your eyes within the first hour of waking. Or if the sun isn't out when you wake up in the morning, to turn on a lot of bright artificial lights and then get sunlight in your eyes for anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on how cloudy it is in the early part of the day. Absolutely outsized effects mood and focus during the day and quality of sleep at night. Now there's another sort of central tenet of getting great sleep and improving mood and focus throughout the day. And that's to avoid bright artificial light exposure to your eyes between the hours of about 10 PM to 4:00 AM. Now leaving shift workers aside, and we have an entire episode devoted to shift work, most people are asleep at night and awake during the day. And you would be wise to avoid exposure of your eyes to bright artificial light between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM. If you're going to use screens or artificial lights, dim them down as far as you can. Now there are several studies that point to the fact that one of the major issues with getting bright light in your eyes between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM is that it has a negative impact on the so-called dopaminergic or dopamine circuits of the brain and body, which can enhance depression. That is lead to ongoing lower mood and affect. So that's a reason to dim the lights or avoid bright lights between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM. However, I and many others need to use artificial light and screens sometimes, even between the hours of 10:00 PM and midnight or even midnight to 3:00 AM, depending on what's going on in my life or your life. That may include you as well. Now it turns out that there are powerful ways to offset some, not all, but some of the negative effects of viewing artificial lights between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM. And one of the most powerful ways to do that is to simply adjust the overall brightness of your artificial lighting throughout the day and in the evening. So one of the issues nowadays that we're really facing is that people are simply not getting enough bright light in their eyes from sunlight or from other sources during the daytime, and they're getting far too much bright light in their eyes largely from artificial sources, of course, in the evening and at night. Not just from 10 PM to 4:00 AM, but also in the evening hours from 6 to 10 PM and so on and so forth. So a very simple yet powerful solution that supported by peer-reviewed research in humans is to try and make your indoor working and/or home environment during the day as bright as possible. Now, if you can achieve that through direct sunlight, terrific. If you can get outside a lot during the daytime, terrific. But many people simply cannot. But most people do have some windows in their environment. I realize some don't but, most people do. And as a consequence, most people are using rather dim artificial lighting indoors during the day and then very bright artificial lighting indoors in the evening, and at night, that's a problem. And if you think about it, logically, you want to do the exact reverse. So it's been shown that if you simply increase the amount of bright artificial light that you were exposed to during the day, and remember this is not an excuse to not get your morning sunlight viewing, but in addition to that, to make your indoor artificial lights very bright, bright, bright, bright, bright throughout the day. And then much dimmer from the hours of 6:00 PM until bedtime. Or if you can't do that, then maybe as soon as you get home from about 8:00 PM until bedtime. And then dim them way, way down between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM or off entirely. That's going to be a far better pattern for your sleep-wake cycles, focus, mood, et cetera than what most people do, which is to have a few windows in their indoor working environment during the day and keep the indoor lights rather dim at a time when they need more photons, more light energy. And then in the evening, when they get home because it's dark outside, they tend to turn the lights much brighter. You actually want to do the reverse. Now there's an even simpler solution, which is to get some bright sunlight in your eyes right around the time of sunset. It doesn't have to be exactly at sunset, it could be in the late afternoon and evening. But it's been shown now in studies on humans, and I'll provide a link to at least one of those studies, that by getting some bright light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight, in the late afternoon and evening. And, of course, the timing will vary depending on time of year and where you are located on the planet. But facing the sun around sunset, you don't actually have to see the sun cross down below the horizon, but facing the sun around that time for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes or even less, even two to five minutes, can adjust the sensitivity of neurons in your retina that communicate light information to the brain and make it such that in the evening when you use artificial lights, they aren't going to have as much of a detrimental effect on your dopamine system and for impairing your sleep. So the idea is as much bright light, ideally from sunlight but also from artificial sources, from the time you wake up in the morning until the evening. Maybe around 6:00 or 7:00. Maybe in the summer months, a little bit later. And then really try and get as little bright light in your eyes as you can in the evening and nighttime hours. And ideally, you would also get some sunlight exposure right around the time of sunset or in the late afternoon. Go outside, take your sunglasses off. Don't try and do this through a windshield or through a window. It will not work. You have to get outside. If you're under an overhang, at least try and get some direct sunlight in your eyes at that time. And that will adjust the sensitivity of your retina such that bright artificial lights or artificial lights of any kind that you're exposed to in the evening and in the late hours of the night won't have as much of a detrimental effect. That said, if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, try and keep the lights dim. Many people have asked whether or not, for instance, a nightlight or a flashlight is going to have as much of a negative effect. This is very straightforward. If you think about it, if you shine a light at something, you can see into your environment. If you've ever been camping or you've walked with a flashlight, you can see things around you that you wouldn't otherwise, of course. But if you were to shine that light in your eyes, it would be far brighter. So yes, of course, if you get up in the middle of the night and you can use your phone flashlight to illuminate the environment that you're in so that you can safely go to where you need to go and then back to bed, that's going to be far better than turning on the lights or, of course, shining light in your eyes, right. So the idea is bright, bright, bright in the morning and throughout the day. And as dim and dark as possible at night. And that afternoon light viewing provides, sort of, what I call a Netflix inoculation that will allow you to adjust your retinal sensitivity and give you a little bit more flexibility in terms of allowing some nighttime light exposure without the detrimental effects. Now I realize today's episode is about happiness, it's not about sunlight or dopamine. And yet, as we'll talk about more in just a moment, if you're not optimizing your sleep and if you are using or being exposed to light rather at the wrong times of the day/night cycle, that is going to make it very hard for the other sorts of practices that relate to happiness to have their full impact. So the backdrop, where I would say the kind of landscape of your chemicals and your hormones, is powerfully controlled by not just the brightness of light but the timing of light and your exposure to light. In particular, your exposure to light to your eyes is something that you have a lot of control over. You don't have absolute control, but you have a lot of control over. And it's been proven that even these small steps, which are completely cost-free. They require just a few minutes of time, but no purchase a product or anything else can allow you to greatly adjust your neurochemistry and your hormones in the direction of better mood, better sleep, and happiness. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools for the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the word nootropics because it means smart drugs. And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits in the brain or body for being quote-unquote smart. Thesis understands this, and they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and body into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish. They use the highest quality ingredients, things like phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC, many ingredients that I've talked about before on this podcast and that I happen to use myself. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a game changer. For me, I like their nootropic for clarity. I used that before cognitive work often. And I like their nootropic for energy. And I often used that before workouts. In particular, workouts that are especially intense. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman. Take their 3-minute quiz, and these will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help me better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One of the problems with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about lipids and levels of hormones and levels of metabolic factors and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker has a very easy-to-use online site where you can monitor your levels. And you can click on any specific marker, any specific hormone, or metabolic factor, and it will tell you the behavioral tools, for instance, exercise, the nutrition tools, and the supplementation-based tools that you can use in order to bring those numbers into the appropriate ranges for your immediate and long-term health goals. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plan. Again that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress well over a year ago, and it's been the best sleep that I've ever had. One of the things that makes Helix mattresses so unique is that they match the design of the mattress to your unique sleep needs. So, for instance, if you go on to their website, you can take a brief quiz. It's only takes about two or three minutes. And you'll answer questions like do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night. Or whether or not you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach, or maybe you don't know. Regardless, they will match you to the custom mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. For me that was the dusk D-U-S-K mattress. Which, for me, was not too firm, not too soft, and was ideal for my sleep patterns. You take the quiz, and you'll find out what mattress is ideal for your sleep patterns. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their brief sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress. And you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. They have a 10-year warranty. And you get to try out the mattress for 100 nights risk-free. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about happiness. This thing that everybody seems to want, and yet not everybody can agree on what exactly it is or how to get it. Now I want to start by quoting a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. And that is a colleague of mine at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who's both a bioengineer and a clinician. That is, he's a psychiatrist who spends a lot of his time both running a laboratory and seeing patients, human patients, of course. And I once was at a meeting where I heard Karl say something to the extent of we don't know what other people feel. In fact, most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel. And while that statement was meant to report several different things about the way that the brain works and emotions, et cetera, one of the things that he was emphasizing, and I know he was emphasizing it because he confirmed this for me, was the fact that language. Things like the word happiness, or joy, or meaning, or pleasure, or delight, are actually not very precise when it comes to describing our brain and body states. So, for instance, if I tell you I'm feeling pretty happy. I know what that means for me, at least in this moment, but you don't really know whether or not it means the same thing as what pretty happy means for you. If I say I'm extremely happy and I have a big grin. I have a grin on my face that I can't seem to wipe off my face. Well, then, you might get a sense of how much happier I am than pretty happy. But it's still hard to calibrate my level of internal state or happiness, and the same is true for you and for everybody else. And it's important for us to acknowledge this because at this point in human history, 2022, we don't really have a measurement like body temperature or heart rate or heart rate variability or even a way to measure neurochemicals in the brain and body that give us anything better than a crude correlate or an estimate, at best, of what happiness is. So that's really important to understand and to keep in mind throughout this episode. It doesn't mean that we cannot have a strong data-driven conversation about happiness and what brings us to a state of happiness. But it's very important to understand that language is not an ideal and maybe even a deficient tool in terms of describing our emotions and our states of mind and body. Now equally important is to understand that while we do have neurotransmitters, that is, the chemicals that are released between neurons, nerve cells that allow neurons to communicate, things like glutamate and gaba, for instance. And we have what are called modulators. These are chemicals also released by neurons that impact the electrical firing and chemical release of other neurons. Things like serotonin, and dopamine, and acetylcholine, and epinephrine. Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters are always present in a cocktail in our brain and body. That is, they are present in different ratios and at different levels. So we need to completely discard with the idea that any one neurotransmitter or any one neuromodulator is solely responsible for a state of happiness or for a lack of state of happiness, for that matter. That said, it is true that for people that tend to have lower baseline levels of, for instance, dopamine, their levels of happiness, or we should say their self-reported levels of happiness, tend to be lower than for those that have greatly elevated baseline levels of dopamine. Now, this can be best appreciated at the extremes where, for instance, in conditions like Parkinson's disease or other conditions where people's levels of dopamine in their brain is severely depleted. Mind you, we also see this in drug-addicted individuals that are in a withdrawal state because they're trying to quit or they don't have access to the drug that normally stimulates release of dopamine. Think the cocaine addict who can't get cocaine. Or the methamphetamine addict that can't or is trying to avoid taking methamphetamine. Or the Parkinson's patient who has fewer dopamine neurons because they degenerated. Those individuals do tend to be more depressed. They tend to have lower affect. They are less happy. At least, that's how they report themselves to be emotionally. And that's what we observe when we look at them behaviorally in terms of the amount of smiling, the amount of energy they seem to have. At the opposite extreme. And while still focusing on the kind of pathology of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems, an individual who is in a manic phase of bipolar will tend to have very elevated levels of dopamine. And those people will talk a mile a minute, and they won't require sleep. And at least to them, every idea is an exciting idea and one that they want to pursue. We did an entire episode about bipolar depression, A.K.A. Bipolar disorder. So if you'd like to learn more about that, please check out that episode. That and all other episodes of the podcast, of course, you can find it hubermanlab.com in all formats. But the point here is that very low levels are very high levels of dopamine are correlated with certain states of, for instance, low happiness or the absence of happiness. We could even call it depression in some cases. Or extreme happiness or even euphoria. Sometimes even inappropriate euphoria, as is the case with bipolar depression or sometimes called bipolar mania or bipolar disorder. Now, of course, there's a range in between depressed and manic. And most people, fortunately reside somewhere in that range. And it is indeed a continuum. And I think it's safe to say that levels of dopamine probably do correlate with levels of happiness. But there is no one single chemical nor chemical signature, that is, no specific recipe of two parts dopamine, to one part serotonin, to one part acetylcholine that we can say equates to happiness. Indeed there's now tremendous controversy as to whether or not, for instance, having lower levels of serotonin is actually the cause of depression or merely correlates with depression or maybe doesn't even correlate with depression, at all. This became especially controversial because, in the last year, the so-called serotonin hypothesis of depression has been called into question. And indeed, it does seem to be the case that for individuals that are depressed, their levels of serotonin can sometimes be normal. However, and this is an important however, that does not mean that administering drugs that increase levels of serotonin in depressed people does not sometimes and indeed often help ameliorate some of their symptoms. And I should mention that many of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. So-called SSRIs such as Prozac and Zoloft, et cetera, are still considered excellent treatments for conditions like OCD and so on and so forth. But what I'm trying to do is make two important points. First of all, that language is not a great indicator of internal state. Especially when trying to understand other people's internal state. And that is especially true for things like happiness. And that there is no one chemical signature of happiness. There's no one neural modulator or combinations of neuromodulators that we can say is the cocktail for happiness. But, and it's a very important, but when levels of dopamine and serotonin tend to be chronically low for an individual below their typical baseline, they will, yes, tend to be lower in affect and have lower mood and less episodes of happiness per day, per week, per month, per year, et cetera. Conversely, when an individual has elevations in dopamine and serotonin levels, in particular dopamine levels and the other so-called catecholamines, which include epinephrine and norepinephrine. So the catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. They're all very similar biochemically. They all lead to states of elevated motivation, energy, and so on. When those chemicals are elevated above baseline, people do tend to have elevated sense of mood and well-being, and in particular sense of possibility about what they can do in the world and what the world can offer them. So we need to acknowledge those two features of language and neurochemistry as we wade into the discussion about the psychology of happiness. And, in particular, about the controlled experiments that have been done in excellent laboratories focused on the psychology of happiness and what brings happiness and what does not. There have been some excellent studies on happiness. And these come in two forms generally. One form of these studies is individuals come into a laboratory. They participate in an experiment over the course of a day or months. And then, data are collected analyzed, and the papers are submitted, and published, and discussed. The other form is so-called longitudinal study. Where individuals come into the laboratory, and they are studied over a very long period of time. Ranging from months to years and sometimes even decades. And then, the variables of age, life circumstances, and other factors can be incorporated into the data. And typically, there are multiple papers, there's data published throughout the longitudinal study, or sometimes it's just one paper at the end of the longitudinal study. Let's talk about one of the more famous and perhaps the longest-running longitudinal study on happiness. This is a study that was initiated or conceived in 1938 at Harvard University. The so-called Harvard Happiness Project. Some of you probably heard about this. It involved Harvard College sophomores and other individuals who were incorporated into this study as well. It's a study that initially had more than a couple of hundred subjects. But because some have either dropped out and not been able to be contacted and monitored over time or died, or for whatever reason, are no longer participating in the study, they're very few of these individuals left. And yet there's tremendous power to a study like this. It's such an impressive study, and we're all so grateful that laboratories at Harvard decided to initiate and continue this study because it is one of the few studies, perhaps the study that has allowed us to understand happiness in our species over a very long period of time. Like any study, it's not perfect. It didn't include a lot of matching by sex or matching by vocation, or matching by income and background. And back then, there was also a lot less discussion about trauma and histories around trauma, as well as positive episodes in people's lives. Nonetheless, there's a lot of power in a study like this. And there are some very basic takeaways, some of which you may have heard before but some of which may be surprising those of you who haven't. So one of the key things about the study is people in the study, at least those who still have intact memory, which many of them do, are able to think back on not just their previous year or week but 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago and compare what makes them happy at one age versus another age. A number of things have emerged from that conversation. So I just want to discuss some of the highlight points then we'll get into a little bit more of the nitty-gritty of the data. First of all, it's been discussed many, many times that the total amount of income that an individual makes or has, and again, this could be income from work, or it could be money that they inherited, does not seem to directly relate to their level of happiness. Now a lot of people take that point and think, oh, money doesn't matter. Other people hear that point and think to themselves, yeah, right, easy to say if you have a lot of money. We'll talk about the interpretation of those data in just a few minutes. But I do want to earmark that finding. Because I agree that while money or total resources itself does not predict happiness in any kind of direct way, that is not the same thing as saying having very few resources will make you happier, of course. I don't think anyone would imagine that. But it also tends to overlook an important point, which is something that I certainly have learned to appreciate in my life and something that I especially appreciated when I was a student and post-doc, which is the following. People will say money can't buy happiness. And we'll talk about the buy aspect of that in a moment. And indeed, that's true. If you look at this longitudinal study or you look at other studies that are done on a more short-term basis. Once people get past a certain level of income relative to their cost of living, the amount of happiness does not scale with that income. That is, for every additional $1,000 or $10,000 that they earn, they don't report being that much happier on a daily basis. Now that said, I venture the argument that while money truly cannot buy happiness, it absolutely can buffer stress. And in particular, it can buffer stress in the form of the ability to purchase or pay for goods and services, and in particular services. You're not going to tell me that having children doesn't involve some increase in the demands on your life, less sleep, and more demands. And it certainly is the case that if you can hire help to clean. You can hire nannies if that's your thing. You can hire help to assist with babysitting or even night nurses if you're having trouble sleeping that will literally allow you to sleep while they take care of your child in the middle of the night. Often give excellent care. One hopes excellent care. That that won't offset some of the stress associated with lack of sleep. So there are a million different examples one could give of this, but I certainly experienced this during graduate school. In fact, I experience both sides of the equation here. I made very little money as a graduate student. I had essentially no savings when I started graduate school, and I made very little money. The amount doesn't matter at this point, but I could just barely afford rent and my food. I actually opted to live in the laboratory a lot of the time. And by doing that, I had more money to spend on other things that were important to me. Now I did not have a family at the time, and so I was able to do that. Something that not everyone can do. But I made very little money, but at the same time, I was in laboratory all the time, and that's where I wanted to be. And so my level of stress was actually pretty low because I was investing all my time and energy into the very thing that I knew would eventually help bring me more resources. When I moved from being a graduate student to a postdoc, for instance. A postdoc is generally a three to five-year period. It's sort of like residency in medicine, where you're no longer taking courses, but you continue to do research. In fact, entire new lines of research and prior to getting a professorship. My income went up slightly, went up by about 30% to 40%. But because of where I moved and because of the times, my cost of living went way, way up and I was extremely stressed. So it wasn't my absolute income, it was my absolute income relative to my cost of living. The other thing that one needs to consider when considering income versus cost of living is there's also this notion of peer group. And we're going to talk more about social bonds and connections later. But one thing that I noticed when I moved from being a graduate student to a postdoc was I was a graduate student in a small town where I had access if I chose to participate in most, if not all, of the social gatherings because they were all very low cost. People tended to aggregate at the farmer's market on Saturday. Most people wouldn't even purchase anything, at least not the graduate students wouldn't purchase anything. It was just a place to aggregate. People sometimes play pickup games of soccer or just hang out have a cup of coffee. There was a volleyball game on Fridays. Sometimes people would go out to eat that evening, which of course, costs money, et cetera, but it was relatively low cost of living. And social connections and peer group interactions were all generated around the same fairly low-cost activities. When I transitioned to being a postdoc, I made more money, but cost of living went up. But in addition to that, my peer group tended to want to engage in the same kinds of activities that people in that larger city were engaged in. So peer group has a tremendously powerful influence on whether or not we gauge the amount of money that we have as bringing us happiness or not. And that really speaks to the critical importance of social interactions and certain kinds of social interactions, in particular. Now, if any of that was unclear, what I'm basically saying is it's not just about being able to pay your rent. It's also about being able to access the kinds of social interactions that you deem are quote-unquote correct for you at that stage of life and in the place where you happen to be living. Because if you can meet all the demands of costs of rent and paying your power bill and food, et cetera, but you are socially isolated because your peer group, or those around you that you want to engage with, are engaging in activities that you either don't have time for, literally, because you're doing other things or that you don't have the financial resources for, then that can actually severely impact this rating of what we call happiness. Why am I parsing this so finally? Well, I'm parsing and finally because I think that most of us have heard the outcome of this study from Harvard or the more short-term studies, also many of which are from Harvard. We'll talk about the just phenomenal work from Dan Gilbert's laboratory and other laboratories who have focused on issues like these. And I certainly don't want to take anything away from those results. They're very powerful and important results that really point over and over to the fact that people's happiness does not necessarily scale with income. In fact, it tends not to past a certain level, and yet I think we'd be remiss, I think actually it would be inappropriate for me to say that the amount of income that one makes is not important. Because if the amount of money that you happen to have or are making does not allow you to meet your basic needs of shelter, health care, et cetera. And/or doesn't allow you to access the kind of social interactions that can renew and reset or, I would say, directly enhance the kind of neurotransmitter systems and hormones that lead us to feel that we are happy in our life and we're having quality social connections, well then that's very stressful. And this brings me back to the statement I made earlier, which is, indeed, money cannot buy happiness, but it certainly can buffer stress. And one of the ways that it buffers stress is by allowing options of different kinds of social interactions. Options of different types of recreation that one can engage in to access new forms of social interaction and so on and so on. So we need to be a little bit careful or at least nuanced about this statement that money can't buy happiness and that the data support the fact that wealth doesn't determine happiness. I think there is a truth to that but there's another side to that, I think is less often acknowledged and that certainly I've experienced and that I think many of you out there have probably experienced as well. One other major finding of the Harvard longitudinal study on happiness, as well as shorter-term studies on happiness, is that much as you've heard, perhaps that no one on their deathbed says they wish they had worked more, well indeed, the total amount of time that one spends working does not seem to determine one's happiness. And yet I also want to earmark that result as one that we need to parse a bit more carefully. Because work, last time I checked and certainly for me, is the way typically that people earn an income. And as we just talked about a moment ago, income is often a way that people have access to or provide access for their family to things like recreation that opens up the opportunity for more social connection, right. So we have to be careful with how we interpret these blanket statements that have become very popular that money doesn't determine happiness and that the amount that you work isn't going to determine happiness. It certainly is the case that if you earn more money from working more and that money is devoted to things that bring more opportunities for social connection or for buffering stress in other areas of your life, including health care, care for your children, care for yourself, recreation, other things that you enjoy, well then I think it's a little bit naive to assume that work itself is somehow counter to happiness. Which, of course, it isn't. And it especially isn't if we combine that feature of work with another important feature of the human psyche, which is this notion of meaning. Now in the not-too-distant future, we will do an episode of this podcast on meaning and what constitutes meaning in a given endeavor, work or otherwise. But much of the psychology of the last century, and still today, focuses on this feature of meaning as a critical one in terms of what makes us happy and what doesn't make us happy, certainly in the long term. And I can certainly say for myself that learning and teaching, and doing research in my laboratory brings me tremendous feeling of meaning and happiness. Some people consider their work simply a way to gain a paycheck, and other people find that they would do the very work they do regardless of whether or not they were paid. In fact, many people will do volunteer work and other forms of work for zero money. So this idea that money isn't important or that work is not as important as we deem it to be, that also needs to be considered from a number of different perspectives. And again, by no means am I trying to undermine the data of these impressive studies, both the longitudinal and short-term studies, but I think we do have to be cautious in our discussion of results like these because the internet is replete with conversations about the big factors that determine happiness. It's going to be social connection, not income. It's going to be the amount of time that you are able to have open thinking and creativity, which I think is an essential feature of happiness, by the way. Physical health. In particular, one's ability to stay mobile and to be able to access the kind of daily activities that one needs to accomplish unassisted is a strong correlate of happiness and so on and so on. And, of course, there are the basic physiology factors. The things that feed back onto our overall feelings of well-being. And I've talked about these before, and we'll just put these quickly into a bin. You can think of this as a toolkit of things that you and everyone really should be constantly trying to access, if not optimize, on a regular basis because they raise the tide or what I would call the buoyancy of your overall system, meaning your brain and body. And that would be getting sufficient deep sleep at least 80% of the nights of your life. And ideally, the remaining 20% you're not getting deep sleep or as much of it because of positive events. Quality nutrition. Quality social interactions. And we will define that a little bit better. In fact, we will define that in a lot of detail later in this episode and actually how to get better at creating quality social interactions, even very brief social interactions. So we have sleep, we have nutrition, we have social interactions. We have purposeful work, whether or not it's paid work or non-paid work. And, of course, there are things like exercise and maybe relationships to pets and things of that sort. And there are a few others as well. All of those are known to increase your overall state of well-being, that puts you in a position to access more meaning and happiness, et cetera. But for most people, I think it's fair to say that earning a living. And earning a living by working is the typical way in which we spend most of our time. So I think we need to put a special bracket around those activities. And it's something we will return to a little bit later in terms of trying to understand how periods of life in which there are big or extensive work demands or extensive family demands on us are indeed compatible with states of happiness or frequent states of happiness and how better to access those. Rather than simply say money isn't important or the amount of time at work really isn't important. That's not what people are going to pay attention to. In fact, I don't know how I will feel on my deathbed. How could I? Human beings are pretty good about understanding how they feel in the present. If not describing it, they are pretty good at feeling it if they have any sense of internal state. That is interception. And you could have some idea of how you feel in a moment. We're pretty good about describing our past feelings, at least in broad contour, but we are not very good at projecting how we will feel in the future. And in fact, that's a theme that's going to come up again and again today. Nonetheless, what we do know on the basis of really solid data are that certain aspects of our well-being tend to change across our lifespan. Now lifespan is something that we need to consider from also a bit of nuance because humans are indeed living longer and longer. And if we look at the data on happiness across the lifespan dated maybe 30 or 40 years back or even 20 years ago, it is consistently described in that literature as a so-called u-shaped function. Where people in their 20s report being very, very happy, but as time goes on and they acquire more responsibility. So typically, getting married and having children in their mid to late 20s and 30s and into their 40s. Having more work demands, et cetera, happiness tends to be rated lower and lower, at least in those previous studies. And then happiness tended to increase as people approach their 50s and 60s. And they tended to retire, and their work demands were shed from them, and they were able to enjoy the small things of life despite the fact that, in general, I would say almost always people's health is not as vigorous when they're 70 as it is when they're 20. There are exceptions to that, of course. Of course, you can adjust the rate of cognitive and physical decline. But in general, people in their 20s feel more physically and mentally vigorous than they do in their 60s and 70s, in general. That u-shaped function that I just described still holds true today, but of course, there have been some major shifts to the general life stages and when people undergo those life stages. For instance, many people are getting married much later. Many people are opting to not have children. In fact, if you look at the data on whether or not people have children or not and how that relates to happiness, everyone will tell you that their kids are their greatest source of joy, at least most people will tell you that and are a tremendous source of happiness. It's obvious. Kids are delightful, and raising kids while hard is a wonderful experience. If you look at the ratings of happiness among people that elected to not have children versus those that had, most people who have children report their overall levels of happiness as lower than that of people who opt not to have children. Now there are a lot of ways to interpret those findings. And by no means am I encouraging people to not have children. That's a issue that you have to resolve for yourself, of course. But we could imagine, for instance, that people who opt not to have children have more income to devote to things more focused on themselves or their partner or other aspects of their life. We don't know if that's the underlying reason. We could perhaps conclude that people who opt not to have children are getting more sleep on a regular basis or have more time for exercise or the other sorts of things that elevate states of mood and well-being. Again we do not know what the underlying reasons are for this finding. But it does seem that despite most every parent reporting that their kids are their greatest source of joy and quote-unquote happiness in life that people who opt not to have children are at least as happy or report being at least as happy or even happier than those that opt to have children. And, of course, I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to settle any arguments about whether or not people should have children or not. I happen to find children and animals delightful. And I'm always happy when people opt to have children provided they are taking good care of their children or doing their very best to take good care of their children. So that's my stance. But of course, you're all entitled to your own stance on this. There are also the general arguments that people like to have about whether or not the population of the Earth will be sustained or not sustained based on current birth rates, et cetera. Indeed many areas of the world, birth rates are going down. It is actually something that just as a perhaps point of interest has been studied from the somewhat unusual but logical perspective of whether or not child diapers are selling at the same rate as they were some years ago and whether or not adult diapers for the elderly are being sold at the same rate or greater. If you think about it is one indirect measure of whether or not people are living longer and/or opting to have children. Definitely in discussion for another time, probably for another podcast entirely. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin-mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Again that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. So this u-shaped function of people being happier earlier in life and then reporting feeling far less happy and then happiness returning to them, that is, the rising of the u again in their later years, is something that I do believe should be repeated in modern times. And repeated in a way that takes into account that you might be shifted to the right. That is, I am certainly aware that people are tending to get married later. Many are opting to not have children. So, for instance, the question arises whether or not that u-shaped curve should have a bump down at the bottom of the u among those that opt not to have children. Because the argument was made in the discussion of those papers that the reason why happiness is lower when people are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s is because they're devoting more time to raising their children and devoting more time to work. I would hope people would enjoy their work, but not everybody really enjoys their work. And many people, even if they do enjoy their work and they find meaning in it, still find it stressful, which certainly can run counter to happiness. Nowadays, you could imagine that because a number of people are opting perhaps to work less or to not have children or both, where they find tremendous meaning from their work that there would be a bump at the bottom of that u among those that decided to simply not take on these additional responsibilities. That would be an interesting test, I think, of whether or not the total load of responsibility is really what's correlating with reported happiness or not. Now one very consistent finding that has absolutely stood the test of time, and it's kind of an interesting one. It's a little bit of a pop psychology finding, but I think it points to something interesting that we will return to again and again is that people tend to report feeling lower levels of happiness, believe it or not, on their birthday. And the argument for why this is the following. That typically, we go through our year not comparing ourselves to our peers terribly much. We might do that a little bit more when we're in elementary school, high school, et cetera. We're sort of age match, maybe even college as well. But an evaluation of ourselves to our age-match peers is not typically something that we do on a daily basis. Whereas on our birthday, we get a snapshot of where we are in the arc of time, or at least in our life. And many people report feeling rather low on their birthday because they use that as a benchmark or a window into the things that they have not accomplished. The things that, despite being age blank, they still haven't accomplished. And so that's interesting because what it really points to is two things. One the extent to which much of our feelings of happiness are relative, in particular, relative to our peers. So there's that social aspect again. And the fact that most of the time, we are not very good at orienting ourselves in the longer arc of time. We're pretty good at knowing where we are in the arc of a day, or the arc of a week, or the arc of a month, or even a year, but that most of us are not very good at reflecting on where we are in our life arc. And, of course, most of us don't know how long we will live anyway, but we do have some general sense. I mean, very few people live past the age of 100. Many people live to be 70 or 80. And again, life span is extending as far as we know from year to year. But, in general, people report that on their birthdays. And I should say these are for birthdays aged 25 or later, at least in the studies I was able to access. I don't think that a lot of three-year-olds sit around comparing themselves to other three-year-olds and how well they're doing or 12-year-olds. You can imagine some people might do that at 18, et cetera. But it's really by the mid-20s that people start evaluating themselves to their peers in terms of life progression and so-called milestones. It's been argued that that's one of the reasons why people report lower affect, lower levels of happiness on their birthday. Something that's a little bit counterintuitive. And, of course, there are things that are anti-correlated with happiness. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a few of these. That's longitudinal study, the Harvard happiness project has reported, for instance, that people that are chronic smokers of nicotine and chronic consumers of alcohol, in particular alcoholics. That is, people who suffer from alcoholism or what sometimes is called alcohol use disorder that is strongly anti-correlated with happiness. And I should also mention that the family members, and in particular, the romantic partners of people who are chronic smokers and the partners of people who are chronic alcohol users, often will report lower levels of happiness. Especially if they themselves are not chronic smokers or regular consumers of alcohol. So we've done episodes on nicotine in particular, and that touched on smoking, of course. And we've done an episode on alcohol and the effects of alcohol on health. Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com. This study from the Harvard happiness project really has strong data supporting the fact that avoiding being a nicotine smoker. There are positive health effects of nicotine that are discussed in the episode nicotine. But being a-- but smoking nicotine, in particular, is counterproductive for people's at least self-reported happiness and certainly overall health. I think there's zero question that smoking increases cancers of different kinds. And that alcohol consumption. And in particular, alcohol consumption beyond two drinks per week. Two drinks being the typical volume of a beer, a glass of wine or cocktail, et cetera, is detrimental for various aspects of health. And, of course, there are other things that you could imagine would relate to a lack of happiness. For instance, a major trauma. Physical or emotional trauma. That could include the loss of a major relationship, a death of a close one. Being the victim of a violent crime and things of that sort. And yet it's been argued, in fact, strongly argued that when you look at people's levels of happiness after a trauma, that if you wait about a year or so, sometimes is even as short as three months after a trauma, that people self-reported levels of happiness are not significantly lower than they were prior to the trauma. Now I very much want to highlight, underline, and bold and asterisks that statement as one that we really need to explore carefully. Because there are other data that strongly point to the fact that major life traumas can severely disrupt one sense of happiness and well-being. And I think as long as we're going to have this discussion, we should point to a useful definition of trauma. And the definition that I'll paraphrase is one that was supplied by a former guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti, who's a psychiatrist who's written a book called Trauma. I personally think it's the best book on trauma and tools for alleviating trauma. It's incredibly thorough, easy to read, and well-informed. And here again, I'm paraphrasing, but Dr. Conti describes trauma as something that fundamentally changes the way that our brain and body function in a way that makes other aspects of living more challenging. Again, an event, either emotional or physical, or both, that fundamentally changes the way that our brain and/or body, our nervous system, and other organs function in a way that prevents us from enjoying daily activities. And that could even be ongoing distraction. Traumas can create rumination, or they can create obsessive thought, or they can create dissociation. Any number of different things. Again check out that episode with Dr. Paul Conti if you'd like to learn more about trauma and how it manifests. But the idea that's been put forth by a number of researchers in the field of happiness that three months after a major trauma, people aren't reported that they are feeling any less happy than before the trauma, that was surprising to me. So I went into this literature a bit more deeply. One of the basis of that general line of thinking is a-- what I consider a now classic and very important and frankly excellent talk that was given by Professor Dan Gilbert on the science of happiness. You can find this on YouTube. I say a classic one because it was done some years ago. It's received millions of views. And one of the points that he makes in that talk which is grounded in research carried out by his laboratory and other laboratories is that-- he poses a question. He says you know, let's do a quiz. Would you rather be someone who wins the lottery and he shows a picture of somebody who just won, I think it was several hundreds of millions of dollars in the lottery, or was recently made paraplegic lost use of their legs? And then goes on to state that one year after people have won the lottery, this major monetary windfall versus have become paraplegic is that their self-reported levels of happiness are the same. Which I think is incredibly surprising. I heard this, and I immediately thought of an experience that I've had where I teach a course at Stanford School of Medicine on neural regeneration. And it's actually a course that I attended some years ago when I was a post-doc at Stanford, so well over a decade ago. And we had-- excuse me. We had an individual come into the course. This was an older gentleman. So older meaning he was in his early 70s. And he had become paraplegic fairly late in life from a cycling accident. And he was and is an expert in what it is to become a paraplegic, of course, because he had that experience, but also because he spends a lot of his time doing volunteer work with people who have become paraplegic and have become paraplegic at different ages. And what he described to me was that the overall outcomes for people that are rendered paraplegic in terms of their mental health and their physical well-being and their management of general life skills scales with how early they had that injury and how long they had the use of their limbs. So it's not straightforward. When I heard this result described by Dr. Dan Gilbert, that winning the lottery and becoming paraplegic basically don't impact your levels of happiness to any different degree when people look back a year later, I was pretty surprised given my experience of hearing this lecture at Stanford. So I thought, wow, from what I understand. Indeed, there are people who are rendered paraplegic and manage that transition very easily. It doesn't seem to disrupt their feelings of well-being, et cetera, but for other people, it can be severely disrupting to their sense of well-being and so on and so forth. I went back and examined these data. And in fact, a subsequent talk, it's actually a podcast that was given by Dr. Dan Gilbert some years later. So this would be just a few years ago. I think in 2019-- there is a specific date in which it was recorded but just a few years ago. And indeed, he corrects himself in that podcast. What he says is that he misspoke in that earlier talk. That the difference in self-reported levels of happiness for those that have been rendered paraplegic for versus those who've won the lottery is not as great as one would expect. I think most people would expect that being rendered paraplegic would make people far less happy. That's the expectation, I think, anyway. And that people would win the lottery, at least for some period of time, would be far happier than they were prior to winning the lottery. And especially given the tremendous amount of money. And again, the fact that money can't buy happiness, but that money does indeed enable the ability to buffer stress provided people were responsible with that money and just didn't blow it or spend it all right away. That they could start to afford things that they couldn't afford, not just in terms of luxury items but also the ability to hire help that would free up time that would allow them to do anything from travel that they couldn't access before to meditate if that was something that they didn't have time to do before. And so on and so forth. So the result quote unquote that winners of the lottery and recent paraplegics have the same levels of happiness is actually not true. At least according to the author of the original study. Now what he did not point to is the degree to which that is not true, but he did point to the direction of the result. And the fact that people who are rendered paraplegic, in fact, are reporting themselves as less happy than they were prior to their injury. And certainly that their levels of happiness are lower than those that simply won the lottery hundreds of millions of dollars, which I think is the more intuitive result. And so I think it's important to be aware of that discrepancy because it's something that was lost in the communication around those results the first time around. And indeed, Dan Gilbert is an excellent scientist and was quite good about trying to correct the narrative. I myself, as a podcaster who puts information on the internet, know that the challenges of correcting narratives, especially of things that came out some time ago, we always attempt to do this as best we can, but not everyone that saw that first video will necessarily hear the discussion that has happened subsequently. So my hope is that Dr. Gilbert will interpret me communicating this now not as an attempt to criticize him but rather as an attempt to praise his willingness to try and correct the narrative to be more accurate. So to be very clear about what this study did and didn't show. And here, I'm going to combine these results with other studies that I was able to find that explored similar phenomenon. So major trauma, for instance. Not necessarily becoming paraplegic but traumas of a different sort, emotional traumas. When you look at the whole of those data, at least, my read is that when people win the lottery or acquire wealth through inheritance, some form of wealth acquisition that is sudden and that wasn't preceded by a specific effort to gain that wealth, right. Buying a lottery ticket is a pretty quick thing. Inheritance is something that you simply get by virtue of who you are, not necessarily by effort. Well, that led to increases in self-reported happiness compared to prior to the inheritance of the lottery win, but it wasn't as substantial as you might imagine if you are approaching the notion of happiness simply from, well, more money equals more happiness. And while it is true that people who are rendered paraplegic or who undergo psychological traumas or physical traumas of any various kind are, and frankly, are remarkably resilient in many cases. They can still manage to go about life and work and engage in relationships, et cetera. There is a visible decrease in overall levels of happiness and well-being, in particular, if the psychological and physical trauma renders their nervous system different in a way that impacts other major areas of life and enjoyment for them. And that's certainly true one year out from the trauma. So the point is that we do need to reframe this idea that whether or not you win the lottery or become paraplegic or suffer some major trauma, your levels of happiness are going to be the same three months or a year later. I don't think that's accurate. And in fact, Dr. Dan Gilbert emphasized that that's not accurate even in that initial study. And I think it's an important thing to frame because that's such a popular notion. Or that that idea combined with the idea that increased earnings don't make us happy combined with the idea that we are happy early in life but then as more demands arise in life, we become less happy, and then we become happy again. And that idea is we already explored is not necessarily true. Frankly, I knew a lot of teenagers and people in their early 20s that are pretty unhappy who then become happier later as they acquire more resources. Sometimes distance, let's be honest, sometimes distance from our family of origin makes us more happy, sometimes less so. It's highly individual. So I think those general themes that we've heard over and over, while they have merit and they certainly stand up in some of the more powerful longitudinal and short-term studies, there is nuance, and in some cases, there are now additional data that are causing us to revise those understandings. Now there is an important point, or I should say the important point, that we can really credit Dan Gilbert and others in the field of psychology with and that we owe them a great debt of gratitude for is that we do have far more control over our levels of happiness than we might think. And many of the things that reside at that level of control. That is, the things that we can do and think and say and access don't come from external things. They don't come necessarily from the acquisition of material goods, but rather there are things that we can do that can allow us to so-called synthesize happiness. And I think this is one of the great gifts of modern psychology is that-- Dan Gilbert and others, the Harvard happiness project, work at Yale and elsewhere. There are excellent labs working on happiness all over the US and all over the world, frankly. One of the great gifts that they've supplied us in the form of data is that there really are things that we can all do and think and access to allow ourselves to so-called synthesize happiness. Now, this notion of synthesizing happiness, or synthetic happiness as it's sometimes called, can sometimes ruffle people's feathers a bit. Because people immediately flip to the idea that, oh, you're just going to tell me to be grateful for what I have or to just navel gaze or just to imagine that I'm happy. But that's really not what synthetic happiness is about at all. Synthetic happiness actually has to do with some really important larger principles about the way that our emotional system and the way that the reward systems of our brain really function. And they point to important concepts that we're going to now discuss. Things like the hedonic set point, for instance. Or the dopamine system of anticipation of rewards versus receiving words just as a brief insight into that. Our anticipation of something positive oftentimes leads to greater increases in the sorts of neurochemicals that support a state of happiness and well-being then the actual acquisition of the thing that we're trying to obtain. And this goes back to a theme I've discussed a few times before in this podcast, in particular with my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, who wrote the fabulous book Dopamine Nation. If you're interested in dopamine and addiction, in particular, that's a wonderful clear, and extremely informative read. And if you're interested in dopamine more generally, not just in the states of addiction but in everyday life and in pursuit and motivation, The Molecule of More is an excellent book related to that. And as I mentioned earlier, we have this episode on dopamine motivation and drive. The notion of synthetic happiness is not simply about imagining happiness, or thinking about happiness or anticipating happiness. To some extent, it is, but it relates to a number of other important themes. But it is grounded very thoroughly in the neurobiology of dopamine rewards. And I'll talk about some of that neurobiology in a few moments. But I want to take a couple of minutes and talk about what synthetic happiness is and what some of the conditions are for allowing us to access the state of so-called synthetic happiness. And I want to point out at the outset that synthetic happiness, while it might sound synthetic A.K.A. false, it's anything but. It actually turns out to be among the more and perhaps the more potent form of happiness that we can all access. And this is where themes related to our control over our own internal state really become not only valid but very powerful. So, for instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert and others have explored how opportunity and choice, that is, freedom can and can't lead to states of happiness. And the results of those studies are very solid and, frankly, very surprising. Until you understand the results, and once you do, I think you will immediately see areas of your own life that you can start to access more happiness, again genuine happiness, simply by framing certain choices in a particular way and maybe even by eliminating choices. Now I'd like to focus on the research aimed at understanding what increases our levels of happiness. And I'd like to frame this under the umbrella of two major themes. The first theme is so-called natural happiness. Natural happiness is the sort of happiness that most of us are familiar with. So the kind of happiness that we expect to have if we, for instance, complete a degree. Hopefully, a degree in a topic meaningful and interesting to us but a degree nonetheless. Or we find a mate. Hopefully, a mate that we enjoy spending time with. Or, for instance, making a certain income or finding work that we enjoy on a regular basis. All of those are forms of happiness that, from a very early time in development, we are taught exist. For instance, even when we are very young, we are told that our birthday is coming and that we are going to get presents, and those presents are going to be focused on knowledge of things that we already enjoy. So if you're a little kid, and you like trucks, or you're a little kid and you like dolls, you can sort of expect that those gifts will bring you some level of joy or happiness. And while that's a small child example, that general notion of natural happiness is, of course, one that persists into adolescence, into young adulthood, and into adulthood. And we quite understandably come to associate this feeling of joy or happiness with the receiving of things or the acquisition of things, whether by effort, by gift, by inheritance, or some other form. So that's natural happiness. And yet, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, there's also this notion of synthetic happiness. And some of the more interesting and exciting research in the fields of psychology and, in fact, neuroscience point to this idea of synthetic happiness as at least as powerful a source of happiness as natural happiness. Again, at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful. And of course, one has to take a slightly different view of what happiness is in order to accept this idea that we can create happiness for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that the whole notion of synthetic happiness is merely a passive one where all we do is sit back and imagine being happy and then we are happy. For better or for worse, our nervous systems and our neurochemistry simply don't work that way. In fact, synthetic happiness has almost always been understood as something that we have to put some effort toward achieving. But, and this is an important thing to point out, synthetic happiness also requires that certain situational or environmental conditions be met. A good example of this is some of the work by Gillian Mandich, or I should say Dr. Gillian Mandich, who's done some interesting work on the conditions for creating happiness within our mind and in our overall state of being. And she's been involved in a number of different studies. But one of the ones that I found particularly interesting is one in which they explored different types of music and other aspects of environmental settings. So you bring subjects to the laboratory play them different types of music. There are, in fact, certain aspects of music that can create different states of mind sadness, happiness, anticipation. In fact, there are certain patterns of music that can reliably induce anticipation of the fear and anxiety base type. So, for instance, think the movie Jaws. If you recall, for those of you who have seen Jaws, there's this ongoing theme music any time the shark might be present in the water or in a given scene. That essentially goes [HUMMING] Now for the musicians out there, this has basis in things like tritones and things that are understood from the mathematics and the musical side. And from the neuroscience side, are known to create a neural state of anticipation. Yeah, a neural state of anticipation and not necessarily a positive one. And indeed, there are other patterns of music that involve up tones. Think some of the music that's typically been used in cartoons of various sorts. There's a long history of this. Indeed there's a whole literature of psychological and now even a smaller but still interesting literature on the neuroscience of how certain patterns of music can induce a state of joy and joyful anticipation, in particular. A lot of those patterns of music are incorporated into so-called happy cartoons and Disney movies and things of that sort. In any case, Dr. Mandich and others have explored how music, in particular, but other features of the environment can or cannot induce states of happiness. And the basic takeaway from those studies is that while having a certain environmental sound, musical tone, or visual feature to a given space, a room, is necessary for a state of happiness, it is not alone sufficient. What is required is that individuals not only be placed into an environment that contains music or visual items or a combination of music and visual items that can induce states of joy or happiness or positive anticipation, but that they also are given some sort of instruction or instruction manual as how to synthesize happiness inside of that environment. This is important because what this says is that our ability to create states of happiness is dependent on our environment but also requires effort from us. That also makes sense as to why when we are under conditions of deprivation. So it could be social deprivation or financial deprivation. Or even for people that are very sensitive to whether. There are a certain number of individuals, about 30% of people, who report feeling very, very low under conditions where the sky is overcast. Especially if it's been overcast for a number of days. The so-called seasonal affective depression. Those individuals, by the way, can often receive tremendous benefits in terms of elevating their mood if they make an effort to get sunlight. And if they can't get sunlight, artificial light of the sort that we talked about earlier. But in any case, there are a number of people that are profoundly negatively influenced by the lack of positive visual and auditory cues in their environment. But for most people, we are in what I would call a dynamic relationship with our environment. Our environment has an effect on our mood. But the research indicates that we also need to make some sort of effort toward being happy. Now effort toward being happy is a very vague term. So let's better define what that is. In the case of Dr. Mandich's work, this took the form of doing so-called happiness inventories, right. That can be focusing on things that one is grateful for, things that they particularly enjoy. This is somewhat of a gratitude-type practice but includes some other features as well that are more focused on the things that bring you meaning and actually engaging in the things that bring you meaning. So if you're trying to think about how to improve your levels of happiness, what this research essentially says is that you would be smart to try and adjust your home environment, adjust your work environment so that it is cheerful to you. Maybe that means a plant. For me, in my laboratory, one of the things that was really critical that I had as a postdoc and in my own laboratory when I first started my lab was I love aquaria. So I had multiple fish tanks. In fact, people in my laboratory were always rolling their eyes. Why do we have to have all these fish tanks with all these-- I like freshwater tanks, not saltwater tanks, for reasons that aren't interesting for this discussion. But freshwater tanks with discus fish, for instance, to me, are just beautiful. They make me happy. I just enjoy them. Music is a complicated thing in laboratories because it's a shared space. So headphones are the general requirement. But having either silence if you love silence. And I happen to like working in silence or listening to certain forms of music. I do also use the 40 Hertz binaural beats. Or I particularly like listening to Glenn Gould while I work or listening to whale song, believe it or not, while I work because it doesn't have any structure that I can follow. I don't speak whale, and so I can't follow. But it sort of fills the space in a way that I find pleasant. And I've put substantial amounts of effort into making my laboratory spaces and my office spaces, my workspaces, nice places to be. Now I had no knowledge of this work from Dr. Mandich and others at the time when I did that. But what I found was that over the years, I was challenged in maintaining a kind of elevated mood while working in a laboratory, not because I didn't thoroughly enjoy the work, I love doing experiments with my hands, and I loved being in lab, but at least the labs that I was in as a graduate student and post-doc there were no windows so I wasn't getting adequate sunshine. The windows that we didn't open, so I wasn't getting a lot of fresh air, and so on and so forth. So I've personally found it very valuable to create an environment both at work and at home that I find aesthetically pleasant, at least in some way or another. And I realize people have varying levels of control over their aesthetic environment. Certainly, the auditory environment can be controlled nowadays through the use of headphones if you're allowed to use those. So, for instance, using music or using background sound that you find very pleasant combined with a concerted effort on your part to create states of happiness by hopefully doing work that's meaningful to you or at least is leading to meaningful outcomes. We'll talk a little bit more about that. But these happiness inventories also turn out to be interesting and important sources of creating so-called synthetic happiness. And we'll also talk about other ways that one can create elevated levels of synthetic happiness. And I realize the word synthetic probably draws up connotations of false happiness or contrived happiness. I wish instead of calling it synthetic happiness. They had called it self-created or self-directed happiness or something of that sort because then it wouldn't sound as false. Because it's simply not false. It leads to the same, as far as we know, identical neurochemical and psychological states of happiness as natural happiness. And might even be more persistent than natural happiness. It certainly, is more under our control. But the key point is that environment and self-directed work at being happy are both important, and they interact with one another. So if you're somebody who has a hard time synthesizing happiness through any of the methods that we talk about today, don't consider yourself deficient. It could very well be that the environment that you're in, social environment or physical environment, or auditory environment, is simply not conducive to synthesizing happiness. And for that reason, I think the work of Gillian Mandich and colleagues and others in the field is tremendously important because it removes us from this pressure to just synthesize happiness from within despite our circumstances. I think many of us have heard of the incredible stories of people like Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela who were stripped of their freedom and yet managed to maintain some sense of positive anticipation or at least some sense of identity that allowed them to still access forms of happiness. Those are highly unique situations, of course. And they speak to the power of the human psyche for synthesizing happiness and certainly for synthesizing a sense that there might be a future and to live into that future. In their cases, incredibly impressive ways. But I think for most everybody, the environment that we're in has a powerful impact on our mood. And some people more than others. I know people that are perfectly happy with blank walls. No pictures on the walls. Other people benefit tremendously from having photos or plants in their environment and so on. You really have to determine what's needed for you and do your best to try and place those things into your environment, or rather, place yourself into an environment that is conducive to you synthesizing your happiness. In fact, the powerful interaction between our environment and our own ability to generate certain kinds of emotions is well established not just for happiness but for things like gratitude. So, for instance, there's a classic study from AMES A-M-E-S in 2004 that was focused on gratitude. And we've had an episode on gratitude before. The basic takeaway of that episode is that it turns out receiving gratitude is a more powerful stimulus for the release of neurochemicals and activation of brain areas associated with so-called prosocial behaviors and feelings of well-being, including happiness. But also observing stories in the form of movies or books or other narratives of other people receiving help is also a very powerful stimulus for gratitude. Also, giving gratitude is very powerful but not as powerful as receiving gratitude, at least that's what the research says, or observing powerful exchanges of gratitude between other individuals. What the study from AMES showed is that gratitude as a state of mind and as an emotion does not exist in a vacuum. It's not independent of our surroundings. So, for instance, just writing down all the things you're grateful for while it has some positive impact, the impact of that or receiving gratitude or observing gratitude is far more potent, right. Bigger increases in happiness and feelings of well-being and indeed neurochemicals and activation of brain areas associated with happiness and well-being when there's a reciprocity. When the person receiving understands something about the person that's giving to them and understands that the person is giving genuinely, for instance. So there's an environmental interaction. It's not just about receiving, it's receiving from somebody that you know genuinely wants to give. And likewise, for the giver in that equation, the feelings of well-being are far greater when the person receiving whatever it is money, food, assistance in some form or another. Could be physical assistance, et cetera. When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving. So the important finding within the research, again and again, is that happiness doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's partially our own responsibility to synthesize happiness. You know, I was told that many times you're like happiness is in your head. Well, yes, indeed, it's in your head, but it's also dependent on interactions with your environment. Physical environment and social environment, and so on. Likewise, gratitude is something that we can create inside of us right through gratitude lists and appreciation, or we can give both powerful sources of evoking neurochemical changes associated with gratitude and happiness and well-being. But it, too, doesn't exist in a vacuum. There's a much greater positive effect when we have knowledge about why the giver is giving us something or that the person receiving something is going to benefit tremendously from receiving it. So I'm highlighting this because I think that when we hear about synthetic happiness, there's a kind of automatic erasing of context that tends to occur. And in fact, if you were to peruse the various videos online or papers that exist on PubMed around happiness and synthetic happiness, in particular, you would come away with the impression that synthetic happiness is just something that we're supposed to snap our fingers in access or perhaps do very specific things in access. But while that is true, context really matters. And I think that's an important point. Much in the same way that the point needs to be made that while money doesn't buy happiness, money can buffer stress and certainly offer opportunities that can provide opportunities for more happiness. So I think we are starting to arrive at a general theme here, which is that nothing related to our mood exists in isolation. And in fact, that leads me to a discussion of one of the major scientific findings in the realm of what sorts of mindsets and behaviors can, in fact, lead to happiness. And this is a paper that was published in 2008. Even though that might seem like a while ago, it forms the basis for a large amount of literature that followed. It's a very interesting literature. This is work from Elizabeth Dunn and colleagues and was published in the Journal Science. Which, again, is one of the sort of three apex journals, Nature, Science, Cell, I always say is sort of the Super Bowl, NBA championships, and Stanley Cup of scientific publishing-- very, very stringent in terms of the number of papers they let in. Very few, that is. And the title of this paper makes fairly obvious what the paper is about. The title of the paper is "spending money on others promotes happiness". And I know a number of you probably hear that title and think, oh boy, here we go. He's going to tell us that giving away all our money is going to make us happier than receiving money. And I promise you, that is not what I'm going to tell you. But nonetheless, this is a very interesting study, and it's one that I think that we really ought to pay attention to. Because what the study is based on is the fact that income, provided one's income meets a certain level of basic needs, indeed has been shown to have only a weak effect on overall happiness. OK? So quoting from the paper in the first paragraph, quote "income has a reliable but surprisingly weak effect on happiness within nations". Within nations just mean they looked at this in not just the United States, but a number of other places, as well. "Particularly once basic needs are met." OK, so if that's the case, then what aspects of money and having money are related to happiness? Certainly, there are people who have a lot of money who are very happy. Certainly, there are people who have very little money who are very happy. And of course, the reverse is also true. There are plenty of people who don't have very much money who are unhappy, and in fact, there are people who have a lot of money who are very unhappy. A point that whenever it's made often leads those with less money to kind of roll their eyes, because the assumption is more money does increase happiness. And in fact, it doesn't. And later, we'll get back to this idea of whether or how one acquired their money has any impact on whether or not that money increases their happiness or not. Let's kind of earmark that for later. In the meantime, let's talk a little bit more about the findings in this paper. This paper is interesting, because what it did is it explored something called prosocial spending. Prosocial spending is a phenomenon where people are taking a certain portion of their income, and they are giving it to others. Often for causes or for things that they think are important to see happen in the world or change in the world. That could be a hungry individual having access to food or medical care. It could be for environmental causes. It could be for animal wellness. It could be for any number of different things. It could even be giving somebody money so that they can buy themselves a gift or giving somebody money and not having any understanding or expectation of what they're going to do with the money. Again, one of the central themes around gratitude is that while receiving is great, giving is also great in terms of increasing sense of well-being. And one of the more important features to that is when we give, either in the form of words or in the form of resources, knowledge that the person receiving benefits from that in some real way, greatly increases the chance that there's an increase in happiness for the giver, as well as the receiver. Again, that's a note about gratitude, but not an insignificant one as it relates to the study. So what the study found was that higher prosocial spending was associated with significantly greater happiness. This was a very statistically significant effect. And they found that the effects of income and prosocial spending were independent and similar in magnitude. Independent and similar in magnitude. I'll explain what that means for those of you that might be confused by that statement in just a moment. Whereas, quote, "personal spending remained unrelated to happiness". So what this study basically found was if people are allotted a certain amount of money to give away, and one adjusts for overall income, and this is important, because you could imagine that for some individual giving away $2,000 might represent a significant portion of their yearly or monthly income. And for another individual it might represent a tiny fraction of their income. But when you adjust for income level, what you find is that people who gave away money benefited tremendously in terms of their own increase in happiness. In fact, quote, "employees who devoted more of their bonuses to prosocial spending, that is giving way more money, experience greater happiness after receiving the bonus, and the manner in which they spent that bonus was a more important predictor of their happiness than the size of the bonus itself". This was an actual experiment they ran with real income, real money. I'm going to read that again just to make sure it hits home, because I found this to be really impactful. "Employees who devoted a greater fraction of their bonus to prosocial spending, that is giving away money to others, experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus. And the manner in which they spent that bonus was a more important predictor of their happiness than the size of the bonus itself." So the actual bonus, the receiving of the money, led to greater increases in happiness if they gave it away. And the act of giving it away itself, led to greater increases in happiness than receiving the bonus. So it's a twofer, as you might say. So the takeaway from this study and studies like it, I think is pretty obvious that to the extent that we can. And again, when I say to the extent that we can, this means whatever percentage of our own income that we can afford to give away, or if we don't have income, the percentage of our effort. I mean this is about money, but it's also about effort. We can help others, right? You can serve in food kitchens, you can do community gardening, you can pick up trash, you can do any number of things. You can assist a neighbor with child care or you can assist a neighbor who is physically less able to retrieve their paper, et cetera, et cetera. The point is that giving resources, certainly in the form of money, but also in the form of effort and time, is immensely beneficial for synthesizing our own happiness. That is for the giver, us, to increase our levels of happiness. But the degree of increase in our own happiness is proportional in some way to the extent to which the person receiving actually needed that help and registers that help. Excellent research also points to the fact that another potent way to synthesize happiness, that is to create genuine states of happiness in ourselves, is to leverage the so-called focus system. Or rather, I should say to de-emphasize the tendency of our minds to wander. There's an excellent paper on this, also published in the Journal Science. This is now a classic paper. I talked a little bit about it in the episode on meditation, but for those of you that did or perhaps didn't hear that episode, I just want to briefly touch on a few aspects of the paper. And in particular, a few aspects of the paper that I didn't talk about previously. And the title of this paper, again, is a very straightforward in terms of telling you what it's about. And that is, "A wandering mind is an unhappy mind" by Killingsworth and Gilbert. This paper was published in Science in 2010, and we will provide a link to the paper. This is frankly, a very interesting paper. This paper involved several subjects, or I should say, 2,250 adult subjects. And what they were able to do was to contact these subjects while they were going about living their daily lives and ask them both what they were doing and what they were feeling. Some additional questions that they asked them, but they were able to establish whether or not people were watching television or doing housework or working on a home computer or resting or listening to music, et cetera, in their natural environment. So this is outside the laboratory. And they were able to assess to what extent those people were happy or unhappy or neutral, or had some other emotional state at the time when they were engaging in any number of different activities. And they assessed whether or not those individuals were also focused on or focused away from whatever activity they were engaging in. And the takeaways from this study are many, but for sake of today's discussion, what I think is especially interesting is that regardless of whether or not people were engaging in activities that they enjoyed or not, the tendency for their mind to wander from an activity predicted lower levels of happiness than if they tended to be focused on the activity they were engaged in. Now that itself should be surprising. I mean, what that says is that even if somebody was engaged in activity like cleaning their house or doing homework or reading something that they weren't enjoying, if they were focused on what they were doing, they tended to report as happier than if their mind was drifting elsewhere. Now this also points to the idea that perhaps our minds drift to unpleasant thoughts more than pleasant thoughts. But they also addressed that in the study. Point I'd like to make here is quote "although people's minds were more likely to wander to pleasant topics than to unpleasant topics" and there the difference is pretty significant. People's minds tended to wander to pleasant topics about 43% of the time as opposed to unpleasant topics about 27% of the time. Or to neutral topics and the remaining 31% of samples. "People were no happier when thinking about pleasant topics than about their current activity". Think about that. "People were no happier than when thinking about pleasant things then their current activity". In fact, the mere focus on what they were doing was more powerful than anything else, even if they didn't enjoy what they were doing. So they go on here to say, quote "although negative moods are known to cause mind wandering, I now see strongly suggested that mind wandering was generally the cause, the cause, and not merely the consequence of unhappiness." So there are a lot of aspects of this study that are worth going into. But the major takeaway, or the one that perhaps we should all be most concerned with, is that when we are not focused on what we are doing, we tend to be far less happy than when we are focused on what we are doing. Even if what we are doing is something that we don't deem very pleasant. And certainly, if we are engaged in something that we consider very pleasant and we are very focused on, well then our levels of happiness are the highest. That's sort of obvious. But what this really speaks to is the tremendous power of building our ability to focus on what we're doing. And to stay present to what we are doing. Now this whole notion of staying present is one that itself is a little bit complicated. And in the episode on meditation I talked a little bit about whether or not it's beneficial to be present to our internal state, or that is our inter receptive state. Our feelings of our heart rate and how full or empty our gut feels or our state of being from our skin inward, or whether or not we should focus on being present to things in our immediate surroundings. Both our versions of being quote, unquote "present" as you can imagine. But in the one case, we're focused internally, in the other we're focused externally, and of course, most of the time it's some combination of the two. But what this study really says is that any practice that can powerfully impact our ability to remain present in the activity we are engaged in, could even be a phone call, could be texting for that matter, could be social media for that matter, right? We're not placing judgment on the activity here. In fact, what we're really talking about is the enormous happiness increasing value of being present to what we're doing regardless of what we are doing. And a practice that's known to be beneficial for increasing our ability to focus is, among other things, a short meditation practice. In fact, work from Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU, again, Wendy's been a guest on this podcast. Her laboratory has shown that even a very brief meditation of about 13 minutes, and this would be the sort of quote unquote "classic" type of meditation of eyes closed, focusing on one's breathing. Even a very brief meditation of just 13 minutes or so done consistently, so ideally, every day. But I have to imagine that even if you skip a day, there are still benefits. That sort of meditation can greatly enhance one's ability to focus. In her studies, that was also shown that sort of brief meditation could also greatly enhance mood and sleep and various aspects of cognitive performance. And work from my laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. David Spiegel at Stanford, department of psychiatry has shown that even briefer meditations of even just five minutes per day can have fairly outsized positive effects on a number of different parameters, as well. Those very brief types of meditations, because they really are focusing and more accurately, I should say, refocusing exercises. When you do that sort of activity of closing your eyes and forcing yourself to focus and refocus on your breath and internal state, that is directing your perception inward. Or if you choose, you could deliberately focus your perception on some external object or sound, for that matter. When one does that, the circuits of the brain involved in focus dramatically improve. That is they rewire and increase their ability for you to achieve focus. Many of us have heard about meditation, many of us think about meditation as a "mindfulness" exercise. Mindfulness in quotes, because that itself needs definition. But I prefer to view meditations of the sort that I just described as perceptual or focus based training, which is really what the data point to. Notions around consciousness and states of mind are very hard to define, but it's very clear that even a 5 minute a day or ideally, an up to a 13 minute a day meditation can greatly increase our ability to focus. And based on the findings in this paper, "A wandering mind is an unhappy mind" also make it very clear that the ability to refocus again and again and again on what we're doing throughout our day, regardless of what we're doing, can have a very dramatic, in fact, a statistically significant increase on our levels of overall happiness. So what else does the research tell us we can do to increase our levels of genuine happiness? Well, it's very clear based on the longitudinal study from Harvard, as well as the Yale happiness project and the work of numerous laboratories in the US and elsewhere, that quality social connection is extremely powerful in terms of its ability to increase our levels of happiness. What is quality social connection? Quality social connection falls into a number of different bins. This can be romantic connection, this can be friendship, this can even be coworker or just daily superficial interaction type connections. That's surprising to a lot of people, because I think a lot of people hear quality social connection and they think deep conversation. But it's very clear from the research that oftentimes our conversations with people that we are closest to are actually quite shallow. If you think about it, if you've been in a romantic relationship or a friendship for a long period of time, or maybe even a sibling relationship or other family relationship, much of what you talk about is fairly superficial or fairly trivial. In fact, it's often a sharing of the trivial day to day things between two people or through groups of people that leads to the feeling that people are really connected to one another. In particular, if it's involving shared experiences of any kind, good or bad. So there's an extensive literature on social connection and how to build social connection. This certainly should be the topic of a full episode of this podcast in the not too distant future. But because social connection can have such a powerful impact on our states of happiness and overall well-being, I want to emphasize a few features of social connection that I think most people might not appreciate. Once again, when we hear quality social connection, I think most of us tend to think about deep, meaningful conversation or long walks on the beach or camping trips together or travel together. And while all of those certainly qualify as wonderful opportunities for social connection, opportunities for quality social connection are certainly not limited to those kinds of interactions. In fact, I can recall times in my graduate career, so this would be times when I was living in the laboratory. Because that was a significant portion of my graduate years. And one of the more important social connections for me was the staff that worked there in the wee hours of the night and that came in very early in the morning. So one of the more regular social connections I had is I would brush my teeth in the hallway bathroom. And there was no one else really around at that time, except for the janitors that tended to leave early in the morning. They had worked a good portion of the night. Or that were arriving very early in the day. And the fact that I would see them on a regular basis and maybe exchange a few words about their work or their families or the holidays, actually for me, became very meaningful. In part, because my social connections at the time were really limited to only social connections that I had in the context of work. Now some people might look at my schedule at that time and look at my life at that time and say, well, that was very unhealthy. You were lacking in certain number of ways. But frankly, looking back, and at the time, and I know this because I journaled at the time, I was exceedingly happy, at least for that stage of my life. At that stage of my life, I wanted to be focused primarily on doing experiments and immersing myself in my scientific training. And for me, the even seemingly insignificant interactions of talking to the janitor in the morning or some of the other regular staff was not insignificant. In fact, for me it was very significant. And over the holidays when their hours were reduced, I actually missed them quite a lot. And even as I talk about this, I can recall the feelings of well-being of just seeing familiar faces. And that brings up an important point, which is there's quite extensive literature pointing to the fact that when we see faces, especially faces in the morning and in the late afternoon, there is a positive impact on the emotional circuitry. Or I should say, the circuitry of the brain that underlies emotional well-being. And that shouldn't come as surprising. We as old world primates, much like other primates, are very dependent on faces and facial expressions in terms of registering our own place in life and our emotional state. Now the origins of this are many. In particular, we have a brain area, it's actually called the fusiform face gyrus. This is an area of the brain that was largely discovered by a woman by Nancy Kanwisher at MIT. And the Kanwisher lab has done extensive work showing that this brain area that's dedicated to the processing of faces, and not just faces in real life, but faces on computer screens and elsewhere, are intimately tied to areas of the brain that are associated with emotionality. That's actually a work from another laboratory, Dorsal's laboratory at Caltech, now at Uc Berkeley, has shown that this face processing area in the brain in both non-human primates and primates is directly linked to the areas of our brain that associate with anxiety and fear. But also, areas of the brain that are associated with well-being. So it comes as no surprise that when we see faces, in particular, friendly faces, even if we have just brief interactions with those faces, and even if no words are exchanged, that creates the sense of social bond. And it creates a sense of predictability. And I raise this again because I think a lot of people think that social connection always has to come in the form of close friendships, which of course are wonderful. Or close romantic relationships, which of course, are wonderful. Or close family relationships, which of course, are wonderful. But as we'll soon discuss in our model of happiness, or how to achieve happiness based on the scientific literature in a few minutes, social connection can and should come in various forms. And when I say various forms, I mean forms of brief interaction, more superficial interaction, and forms of deeper interaction. All of those are relevant to our states of happiness. And there's research to support that daily interactions with somebody at a cafe or just a brief hello or a smile. Provided that we are both present, or we make the effort to be present to those interactions, however brief they are, can have a positive effect on people's overall well-being. And not just in that moment, but consistently. Evidenced by the fact, I think, that when I look back on those years of working long hours in the laboratory and essentially restricting myself either to exercising, sleeping, eating or working. Again, that's what I wanted at that stage of my life. Certainly, not the way I live my life now. But that's what I wanted that stage of my life. That even those seemingly insignificant social interactions were important to me and had a potent impact on increasing my level of happiness. And frankly, still do. And I feel that right now. That said, I think all of us can appreciate the immense value of social connection that is of the more long lasting, and for lack of a better word, richer type, whether or not that is with siblings or with parents or with friends or with romantic partners. For that reason, I want to emphasize a little bit about what constitutes connection and what constitutes social connection. There are basically two forms of social connection that have been studied and I'll review both, as it relates to increasing our levels of happiness. And the first one is presence and eye contact, and the second is physical contact. So in terms of presence and eye contact there's been a lot of studies about whether or not people exchange direct eye contact during conversation or not, dictating whether or not each individual in that interaction feels as if they had a connection. Now again, keep in mind that while we think of connection as relating to some deep or meaningful conversation, and oftentimes that can be the case. Think for instance, an excellent therapist patient relationship. Or an excellent romantic relationship. Or an excellent friendship where you really feel heard and understood, or at least to the extent that people are willing to explore certain topics with you. You're willing to hear them and listen really carefully for what they're saying, and they're willing to hear and listen to what you're saying in an attempt to understand. That certainly can enhance the sense of social connection leading to what people would call social bonds leading to increased happiness. But eye contact is also known to be an important feature. The thing about eye contact is that most people assume that a lot of eye contact, and in fact, ongoing eye contact, is critical to a sense of connection. And in fact, that's not the case. There's a recent paper that I find really interesting that was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2021. The title of this paper is "Eye contact marks the rise and fall of shared attention in conversation". I find this paper interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, my laboratory works on internal states and vision, so it relates directly to the work that my laboratory does. But also, that it violates what I thought was a general rule of social connection, which is this idea that two people needed to be focused on one another, that is looking at one another directly and fairly consistently throughout a conversation in order for the feeling of connection to emerge. But it turns out that's not the case. And in fact, just to give you the takeaway and then I'll flesh it out a little bit with some data, eye contact, or I should say mutual eye contact, so two people registering the presence of the other person looking at them. You're looking at me and I'm looking at you. If you're watching this on YouTube, then perhaps we are actually doing this at that moment. And if you're listening, just know that I'm looking directly into the camera as I'm saying this at this moment. If we were to be looking directly at one another, that, it turns out, signals the next step, which is that it's very likely that we will each both look away. And that turns out to be a way in which we set and reset attention continually during conversation. So again, I really like this study because of the high fidelity. The high temporal precision. That is, the precision over time at which they looked at eye contact and engagement of attention between individuals. And they did this by looking at things like pupil size and of course where the eyes were looking and so on and so forth. The basic takeaway of this study was the following. And here I'm quoting from the study. Quote "Rather than maximizing shared attention, good conversation may require shifts in and out of shared states accompanied by eye contact". So what this basically says is that when two people are involved in a very, let's call it an intimate conversation, but the word intimate should not be misconstrued to mean something about intimacy or sexual intimacy or physical intimacy. Just a conversation in which both people feel present to the conversation and focused on that conversation and that conversation and its contents only. The tendency is for people to take turns talking, although sometimes, depending on the individuals they might interrupt more or less. Again, interrupting can be a sign of interest, it doesn't always have to be rude, by the way. But they're sharing information. Hopefully, about a common topic or set of topics. They will at some moment look at one another. That's what the study shows. And that after briefly gazing directly at one another, attention peaks, and then they will look away, and attention will get reduced. And then the conversation consists of a series of focusing back on one another with their eyes, and then focusing off, focusing on and focusing off. And those mutual eye contact moments actually predict the breaking of attention. So it's this ramping up of attention and braking of attention. Ramping of attention and braking of attention. I think these are important results because they violate this stereotype or assumption that deep social connection of the sort leading to happiness always involves ongoing eye contact or ongoing focus. Just as with meditation, just as with any activity, frankly, we undergo shifts in attention and focus. That is focus ramps up and then it breaks, and then it re-engages. It ramps up it breaks, and then it re-engages. And that, it turns out, is the basis of in-depth connected conversation. So for those of you that are interested in creating social connection in any context, and in particular for sake of increasing happiness, because it's very clear that social connections, even if they are fairly superficial social connections, can increase our sense of happiness. Seeing faces is important. Ideally, faces in person, although I suppose these days, over Zoom or over other screen type medium would be a close second. But the point is that if you want to increase happiness you need to have quality social connections. And if you want to have quality social connections you need to be present and engage in those social connections. And that requires a viewing of each other's faces, ideally, which is not to say that a phone call or text exchange can't be meaningful. But that faces are really the most powerful way to engage in social contact. And that eye contact, not consistent eye contact, but eye contact of the sort that builds up and then breaks and builds up and breaks across the interaction is going to be the best way that we are aware of to feel that one had a real connection. This should also remove any pressure that you might feel to constantly look at somebody or to be completely eyes open staring at them without blinking or diverting your attention at any point during a conversation. This also frankly, is an opportunity where if somebody says, hey, you're not paying attention because you look away, that you may actually be engaging in what is the more typical form of healthy connection. I talked about this long ago on an episode about focus. It turns out when we are listening very intently to somebody and trying to remember the information they're telling us, we will often close our eyes. And that's not a form of lack of attention, that's actually a form of attending in. Because we have so much of our brain devoted to vision. When 40% of our brain is devoted to vision in some way or another, when we close our eyes, we can actually devote more attentional resources to remembering the specifics of what people are telling us. But again, please don't go through conversations with your eyes closed the entire time. I think that would certainly not be conducive to building social connection. So we know that faces are important for social connection as it relates to synthetic happiness. And we know that eye contact is really important for building social connection. Physical contact is also important for social connection. And not just romantic or sexual type connection. In fact, there is a form of physical connection that is present in other primates. In fact, it's present as far as we know, in all mammals. And is also very much a feature of the human nervous system. And that's something called allogrooming. I have to imagine that most people probably haven't heard of allogrooming. The reason I'm bringing up alogrooming is that it stems from a fairly extensive literature about the prosocial, pro happiness effects of pets on humans. In fact, if you want to read up on this, there is a paper out of Yale University on this topic that was published in 2018. The title of the paper is "The influence of interactions with dogs on affect", OK emotion, "anxety and arousal in children". And it references some other studies that were performed on humans. And the basic takeaway is that these so-called AAAs, animal assisted activities, represent a really potent way to increase people, including children's feelings of well-being. Now what's interesting about this to me is that dogs themselves don't really have to do much except be present in the room in order for these positive effects, that is, the reductions in anxiety, increases in happiness, et cetera, to occur. And in fact, they can be very, very brief. As they describe in the paper, "brief unstructured interactions with an unfamiliar dog", so you don't even need to know this dog, "after exposure to a moderate stressor showed higher positive affect relevant to participants who received a soothing object or waited for the same amount of time." So just even seeing a dog for a brief amount of time has been shown to reduce stress and improve happiness, or I should say, increase feelings of happiness overall then a child receiving a soothing object. Which was, at least for me, a little bit counterintuitive. I would have thought that children receiving a soothing object would have been the more powerful stimulus. But in fact, it wasn't, at least not in this study. The real question I think we should be asking ourselves is, what is it about interactions with others and with other animals that could potentially have this prosocial happiness enhancing effect? And the reason I raise this is also because I think many people are interested in either owning or having interactions with pets as a way to improve their feelings of well-being. And I say having interactions with because I myself am a good example of somebody who wasn't always able to have pets. So when I was a graduate student in a postdoc, I very much wanted a dog. Very, very, very much wanted a dog. In fact, there was a rule in my family at some point that I wasn't allowed to talk about dogs anymore because I was talking about all the breeds of dogs. Going to dog breeders, examining different breeds, going to the pound, et cetera. The point was that I was obsessed with getting a dog, but I knew I wasn't in a good position to own a dog yet. I didn't have the finances, I didn't have the correct living situation and so on. Eventually, I did own a dog, of course. But at the time I couldn't. So what I would do is every Sunday I would go to a place where they fostered dogs and they needed dog walkers. And I would walk their dog. I would also walk my neighbor's dogs. I didn't charge them for it. In fact, I felt like I was being paid by getting time with those dogs. And in fact, I put an ad at that time on Craigslist that I would walk people's dogs for free, and only a few people took that seriously. But of the ones that did, I had a great little cadre of dog owners that would allow me to take their dogs out and I was super happy. It just made me very, very happy. And I really enjoyed it. And frankly, it was a great opportunity for me to also get to the various dog breeds and the different dog temperaments and to learn a bit about my ability to interact with dogs in a certain way. I actually got to be a pretty good dog walker. Unfortunately, later I got a bulldog. And it turns out no matter how good a dog walker you are, Bulldogs just simply don't like to walk. In fact, if you've ever walked up to a bulldog and you've offered to scratch or pet that dog, you'll notice that Bulldogs love that. And I would argue, having been a bulldog owner, that they like it because it's an opportunity for them to stop moving. But that's more about the bulldog than what I'm about to tell you next, which is this principle of so-called allogrooming. Allogrooming is a pattern of behavior that's observed in essentially all mammals but very strongly in nonhuman primates and primates, where individuals within a species touch one another. And this is non-sexual touch. So this would be someone brushing somebody else's hair or combing their hair or even using a lint roller on them, for instance. Or someone grooming somebody else. Now typically, one needs to have an established relationship with this person. So it could be a professional type relationship where this is a barber cutting somebody's hair or a hairdresser cutting or styling somebody's hair. It could be somebody giving someone a manicure or a pedicure. Could be somebody doing skin care or massage for somebody in a professional context. Or it could be two people who have agreed that it is appropriate for the context and for the relationship for one person to be grooming somebody else. Can even, believe it or not there's literature on this, can even extend into the realm of people sort of cleaning and picking off other people. Now when we see this in primates, it seems like a very cute and sort of almost understandable behavior. We can see these pictures online. If you look them up, you can just look up allogrooming and you'll see vast number of pictures of for instance, baboons picking little things out of each other's hair. Or grooming and kind of perusing one another, to find things, presumably parasites or like little bits of plants or something like that they want to remove from them. Allogrooming is known to stimulate a certain category of neurons called the C tactile fibers. These are a particular category of so-called sensory neurons that innervate our skin. So these are literally like little endings of neurons, little wires that end up in the skin, that when they are touched lightly tend to create a feeling of well-being in the person that's being touched. Again, this is consensual touch that's very context appropriate. But it's known to increase levels of oxytocin, a kind of hormone slash neurotransmitter. It's both, really. That is known to evoke feelings of bond. Or of feeling bonded to somebody or something. And for many people we hear about oxytocin and we think about the bond between parent and child, in particular mother and infant where it's been most extensively studied. Or between two members of a romantic couple. But if you look at the literature on allogrooming, what you find is that when humans groom one another, the increases in oxytocin that are experienced are at least on par with and in fact, more often, more dramatic in response to allogrooming than in response to other forms of touch. So the point here is that allogrooming is a prosocial behavior that tends to associate with and promote feelings of well-being and happiness. And this is not a trivial effect. If you look at the brain imaging data or other forms of data on this, allogrooming is a very powerful form of bonding between individuals that's completely nonverbal. In fact, most often it doesn't involve eye contact. I suppose two people could be looking at one another grooming one another, but typically, this is done from the side or from behind. Why did I bring up the paper on pets? Well it turns out that when humans stroke dogs, or brush their dogs or stroke cats or brush their cats, et cetera, that is a form of human to animal allogrooming. And it's one in which both the pet and the human receive huge increases in oxytocin and other related neurochemicals that make us feel bonded. I bring this up because the Harvard longitudinal study on happiness, and many, many others, if not hundreds of other studies on happiness, point to the importance of quality social connection. You hear this over and over again. People on their deathbeds don't say they wish they had worked more. People on their deathbeds talk about the richness of social connections or the wish that they had invested more in social connections. I think a lot of people think of social connections only in terms of travel with or conversation with others. But much of what we perceive as deep social connections also involves physical contact. And that's something that's deeply rooted in our evolutionary biology. And it's present both in us and in non-human primates. And it's clear that we can engage in these kinds of pro-social, non verbal, non eye contact type behaviors through things like non-sexual tactile touch, a.k.a. allogrooming. So we've been talking about a number of the different things that one can do in order to increase levels of happiness. And certainly, before we conclude today, I'm going to touch back into not just synthetic happiness and the various things we can do, such as prosocial spending, allogrooming, social connection, et cetera. But also things related to happiness that involve focus on vocation and work and pursuit of goals. Because as I mentioned at the beginning, those are also critical to increasing our state of happiness, and certainly our state of security and the feeling that we can provide for ourselves and perhaps for others, as well. So we will talk about that. But I think it's also important to talk about this notion of choice and choices, and whether or not having a lot of freedom to choose or limited freedom in choosing what we do and what we get, and what we are able to pursue in life, how that relates to both natural happiness and synthetic happiness. Dan Gilbert and others have explored this issue of freedom of choice and how it relates to happiness. And there I must say, the findings are incredibly counterintuitive. But very, very well supported by all of their data. I'm going to summarize a large amount of those studies at once by saying the following. Dan's laboratory and other laboratories have done experiments where they give people a series of options. And one of the more classic examples, they give people the opportunity to rate a number of different paintings or pictures in ascending or descending order of preference. In other words, they're deciding which ones they like most which ones they like least. Then what's interesting is the experimenter will vary the extent to which they have to stick to that choice. So this could be sticking to the choice by receiving that painting to take home. Or in another experiment, it was having to make a choice between giving up one photograph that they, the research subject took, or another photograph that they took. One of the photographs was going to go off to a publication, another one they could keep for themselves. And the conditions in that experiment were either that you had to make the decision and it was final, that is, you could keep one and rate your decision, or you could keep one and then you had the opportunity to swap out that picture for the other one at some later time. In other words, these experiments really weren't about rating pictures, they were really about whether or not constraining your choice, meaning forcing somebody to make a choice and stick to that choice, led to greater levels or lesser levels of happiness and satisfaction with that choice. And what they find consistently is that when people have an ongoing set of choices it leads to reduced levels of happiness. Now that might come as surprising to many of you, but I want to be clear about what this means. This is not to say that having a lot of choices of what you like most leads to lesser happiness. And that having fewer choices about things you do, or objects you acquire, et cetera, leads to greater happiness. What this set of experiments really points to is that when we make a choice, if we are forced to stick to that choice we tend to be far happier with that choice than if we maintain the option to change our mind. The results of these experiments are extremely informative, I believe, in terms of understanding our real life happiness. That is, happiness outside the laboratory. But I think they are often misunderstood as meaning that if we have a lot of choices we tend to be less happy than if we have fewer choices. That is not the case. Having freedom of choice is terrific. And actually, correlates with elevated levels of happiness. But once we make our choice, it's clearly the case that killing all other choices or having all other options killed for us increases our satisfaction with the choice that we've made. Whereas, leaving doors open, leaving options open greatly diminishes our sense of satisfaction. This has been exported to any number of different domains. So this has been exported to the domain of making choices about what college to go to or what partner to select in life. In every one of those instances, we see that our happiness with our choice is very much related to that choice being either the only one or one of very few other options. There are a number of different ways to interpret this. Through the lens of neuroscience we might say that the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that's involved in decision making and evaluating different options, is an area of the brain that's vital, frankly, to our evolution as human beings and to our daily life and to our whole life. It is, of course, the thing that allows us to evaluate different rule sets, to change rule sets, to switch contexts and to create meaning, et cetera. To interpret what's good what's bad. But it's also a fairly costly process, meaning it's very metabolically demanding. And there's an entire literature related to what's called ego depletion. This is certainly a topic for a future podcast. But ego depletion essentially says that if I have you attend very intensely to a given task, for instance, asking you to count backwards from 1,000 to 0 in increments of 13. And then have you switch about halfway through, that's hard for a lot of people. If I have you do that, then your ability to suppress impulsive behavior and to do a hard cognitive or physical task immediately after that is actually suppressed. This so-called ego depletion. It relates to a number of different things, but it certainly relates to engagement of the prefrontal cortex, which is very metabolically demanding. So evaluating choices and doing computation of numbers or attending to things with your mind and forcing yourself to focus intensely is metabolically demanding. And that's a limited resource that can be reset by things like sleep and non sleep deep rest or idle time or letting your mind wander. In that case a positive mind wandering to allow your brain to reset its ability to focus. But the other thing that it does is it impacts the reward circuitry of the brain, the so-called dopamine reward circuitry and other reward circuitry of the brain. And here I'm painting with a broad brush. But it essentially divides them such that for instance, if a given choice of a let's say a partner or maybe buying ourselves an article of clothing, not that I want to compare selection of a life partner to selection of an article of clothing. But just to give multiple examples. Might give us, and here it's arbitrary units, x units of dopamine increase. Well, if we buy that article of clothing or we select that life partner, and then we emerge from the store or the wedding and we are focused on what we purchased for ourselves, our choice, or our life partner choice, and only that, well then there's a certain amount of neurochemical reward associated with that. And happiness and well-being. But it's also very clear that if we leave those choices, the store or our wedding for instance, or a life with somebody for a moment, even just mentally, and start thinking about the other options that we might entertain as possible. If those are still open to us in reality or in our mind, well then our reward circuitry becomes fractured in a way. Not physically fractured, but less attention is devoted to the reward circuitry associated with our choice. And as a consequence, instead of it being x units of dopamine, it's x divided by however many other choices we might have available to us in our mind or in reality. So instead of, and again, these are arbitrary units, but instead of a certain amount of reward, it's a certain amount of reward divided by the number of other options that we might be considering as alternatives to what we chose. And I think this is a very important aspect of understanding how limiting our choices after we've made them is a vital part of what we call synthetic happiness. In fact, we could even go so far as to say that focusing on the choices we've made and really investing in those choices as good ones, or great ones, and really trying to limit our thinking to the choices that we've made once we've made them is perhaps also important to our natural happiness. Because it's so inextricably entwined with what we think of as a good life. And what I mean by that is if we are constantly in a mode of evaluative decision making, even after we've made a decision, we are not neurochemically nor psychologically able to extract the feelings of happiness associated with the choice that we made. So we've talked about a number of different dimensions of happiness, both in synthetic and natural happiness. And some of the more counterintuitive aspects of happiness. For instance, that people tend to adjust their levels of happiness not regardless but often in spite of their life circumstances. But as we emphasized earlier in the episode, that is not to say, at least the research does not directly support the idea that a major trauma or loss won't impact our happiness. In fact, it tends to. And that's why it's important that people access resources and work devoted to overcoming trauma, which certainly exists out there. And of course, there are the longitudinal studies in short term studies showing that income level and material things don't necessarily scale with happiness, and vise versa. And yet, we also acknowledged early in the episode that while indeed money can't buy happiness, it can buffer stress. And while work doesn't necessarily bring happiness, per se, work can bring a tremendous feeling of meaning and resources which can then put you into context in which things like prosocial contact and enhanced bonds and caretaking of others and of you can be enhanced. So it would be unfair and in fact, inaccurate, to simply view happiness through the lens of money doesn't matter, it's all about social connection. And so on and so forth. Absolutely, social connection is important, which is why we spent some minutes talking about some of the ways to enhance social connection both with other human beings and other animals, and them with us. I think there's a opportunity here to take the research on happiness, the research on the neuroscience of what happiness and gratitude and prosocial connection tells us, and to combine it into a bit of a model or a toolkit, if you will. And I think indeed, this will be a toolkit in one of our future toolkit episodes, likely merged with the toolkit on gratitude, which we haven't done yet. And perhaps even we will do an entire episode on social bonds and how to enhance or build social bonds. Or at least what the science tells us about that. If we take a step back and we look at the concept of happiness, we can make a couple of absolute statements. That is, statements that I think very few people, if any, would contest. First of all, there's no single molecule or chemical associated with happiness, but that the chemical milieu of the brain and body is important for setting the stage or the opportunity for happiness. Hence, why there are treatments aimed at alleviating depression or mania that target certain neurochemical systems and hormone systems. Happiness, at least the way I'm framing it today, has essentially two components. One is meaning. That is, what sort of meaning do certain types of interactions or behaviors, could be work, could be social interactions, et cetera, carry for us? And nested in that is this concept of connection. And we talked a bit about tools for enhancing connection. Things like eye contact, but not constant eye contact. Things like being very present to a conversation or an activity that you're engaging in. Remember, we talked about the paper, "A Distracted Mind is an Unhappy Mind"? The paper published in Science. And we talked about the study, also published in Science in which giving money, but also knowing how that money has positively impacted others, leads to this feeling of pro-social connection and happiness in the giver and in the receiver. And I should mention again that it's not just the giving of money but also the giving of effort and time and attention that can have similar effects. So we have meaning and connection, and a number of different ways to access those. And then we have this access that I'm referring to as performance and resources. And I'm talking about performance and resources as it relates to natural happiness, not synthetic happiness, but natural happiness. Because we would be wrong, I believe, if we were to say that income doesn't matter. I think it's fair to say, based on the research, that income matters. And income that can cover costs of living plus that includes some buffer. And what do I mean by buffer? I mean buffer to the anxiety that circumstances might change is important. Now that's going to vary from person to person. Meaning some people will be perfectly happy making $1 more than their absolute cost of living every month. Other people will require a more substantial buffer in order to protect them against the negative psychological effects of worrying about for instance, inflation. Or worrying that they might lose their job. And this is why I think most people recommend having, if possible, some buffer in their bank account that could cover two or three or maybe even six or maybe even 12 months of living expenses were they to lose their job or something catastrophic happened to them. So if we're going to talk about happiness, I think it's only fair, only accurate, and frankly, only respectful to talk about living requirements and cost of living requirements. That includes this sort of buffer. And that buffer to anxiety is going to vary depending on how anxious somebody gets about the possibility of catastrophic things happening to them, like losing their job or their rent going up or doubling. And here, I'm talking about hypotheticals. But I think we all know people and perhaps ourselves have experienced those kinds of circumstances. So when we talk about happiness we absolutely need to think about resources. And we also need to think about performance. I think we would be completely inaccurate if we simply said, oh, any work leading to any outcomes. Any effort, regardless of whether or not it gets you an A in school or an F in school isn't going to impact your happiness. I don't think anyone would agree with that. And yet if you look at the major takeaways, at least as they are communicated typically in the public sphere around the longitudinal and short term studies of happiness, the takeaway generally is more focused on social connection and how money is not important. I don't think anyone that's saying that actually means that income that can cover your expenses plus some buffer isn't important. But it's often not stated. So if we were to come up with a general model of happiness that includes various tools for how to increase our levels of happiness, I think it's only fair to include both natural and synthetic forms of happiness and to pursue both natural and synthetic happiness. Just to remind you, natural happiness is the kind of happiness that we associate with obtaining something, either by effort or because it was given to us. Although, I definitely want to highlight the fact that receiving things that don't require much reward in order to receive them over time can be detrimental to our dopamine system. That's an important aside. The other form of happiness is the form of happiness that we call synthetic happiness. Which is, for instance, focusing on social connection. And we talked about ways to do that as a means to enhance your happiness. Again, the language, the name synthetic happiness implies something kind of artificial. But frankly, genuine social connection is genuine. There's nothing artificial about it or synthetic about it, is that you can synthesize it through action, through deliberate action. Likewise, being focused or encouraging yourself. Working on being focused on whatever activities you happen to be engaged in, positive or negative, is known to increase your levels of happiness. Again, this is a form of synthetic happiness. You're not obtaining anything new or additional as a consequence of this. It's entirely internal. There's no external reward. There isn't more money that arrives with this or a better grade. Although, I would make the argument that if you are present to the work you're doing in any context, physical or mental work, it's very likely that you are going to perform better at that work. So we have natural happiness and synthetic happiness. And both of them require our attention and effort. And in fact, if we were to draw a link between natural and synthetic happiness, it really is this concept of presence, of really being focused on what we're doing, that's most likely to lead to the outcomes that we want. Both externally, in terms of receiving monetary rewards or grades, or praise, or whatever it is that you happen to be pursuing out there, resources of some kind. And presence, and striving to be present when in the pursuit of so-called synthetic happiness in the form of social connection or in the form of really focusing on the choice that you've made and making the best of that choice, especially since you made that choice in a way that you deemed best at the time. Well, that also is known to increase your overall levels of happiness. So if an ability to focus and attend to things deeply is really what's most important, and really acts as the greatest lever for both natural and synthetic happiness, well then, tools like a 5 minute daily meditation or a 13 minute day meditation, as well as tools that allow us to get excellent sleep every night. Which, of course, sets the basis for attention during the day. If you've ever had a poor night's sleep then you are very familiar with how hard it is to focus the following day. At least for long periods of time. But building our capacity to focus through a focusing exercise, which again, is often called meditation, but is really simply just a focusing and perceptual exercise. That's going to create an outsized effect on all the aspects, all the behaviors that we know feed into creating natural and synthetic happiness. And so it's really fair to say that our ability to attend and focus really equates to happiness. So as is often typical of this podcast, today we've talked a lot about the various aspects of the science of happiness, including the different forms of happiness and tools to access those different forms of happiness.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] Recently the Huberman Lab podcast hosted a live event at The Wiltern theater in Los Angeles. It was entitled The Brain Body Contract. The first part of the evening was a lecture about science and science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. The second half was a question and answer period, in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast, or related to their own interests or things that they've gleaned from social media, or just general questions about mental health, physical health, and performance. And I answered those questions for them. We wanted to make the recorded version of that question and answer session available to everybody, regardless of who could attend. So what follows is the question and answer period from The Wiltern theater Brain Body Contract live Huberman Lab event. I want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event. They were Eight Sleep, which makes smart mattress covers with heating and cooling capacity. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it is completely transformed by Sleep. I sleep so much deeper, I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep. In fact, I love my Eight Sleep so much that when I travel, now I'm quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers on them. And I've even shipped my Eight Sleep mattress cover out to meet me in the location that I arrived to so that I get the best possible sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleep, go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 Cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. I'd like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentous. They make the very highest quality supplements. They ship internationally, and they've formulated supplements as single ingredient formulations that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast. If you're interested in any of those supplements, please go to livemomentous.com/huberman. And now without further ado, the question and answer period from the Huberman Lab live event in Los Angeles. [MUSIC PLAYING] What occurs in the mind body when you have ADHD? Are there ways to address it without medication? Thank you for this question. So attention deficit hyperactivity disorder used to be called ADD. The hyperactivity part is a little misleading. And again I'm not a clinician here. Here's what we know works for some people, and yet there are always going to be side effects of any kind of chemical manipulation, which is that, we know that people, kids, and adults with ADHD actually have a tremendous capacity to focus if they like what they're focusing on. You take a kid with ADHD who can't focus and you give them their favorite video game and they are a laser. The threshold to access the dopamine system is higher. And dopamine has this incredible ability to focus the brain and other aspects of the nervous system. Certainly, if people require medication, I'm not going to tell you to stop taking that medication. But the focus training exercises that have been explored mainly in China, but they're starting to be explored over here as well, do seem to be of benefit. And these are as they sound. They use them in schools in China now, which are literally visual focus exercises. Your mental focus, that is your ability to focus on things cognitively, follows your visual focus. And of course your stress will anchor your-- essentially put you in a soda straw view of the world. So yes, there are non medication-based treatments. By medication I'm assuming you mean prescription medication. There are of course supplement-based medications that will increase dopamine mainly L-tyrosine. Again, this is something to think carefully about before you start tampering with your dopamine system. But it is the-- L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. So it will raise your dopamine levels. But I believe, and you'll hear me say this as many times as necessary, that one should-- if you can rely on behavioral tools first, then of course, sleep and nutritionists are prerequisite. Again, for all mental health, physical health performance, you simply can't neglect those. And then and only then if all of that isn't working to rely on supplement-based tools or on prescription medication. So it's clear that Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, et cetera work for ADHD, but some people choose to rely on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation like L-tyrosine. And this focusing exercise essentially consists of spending 1 to 3 minutes trying to maintain visual focus. And yes, you are allowed to blink. I don't know why we tend to stare at something we don't blink. But don't let your eyes dry out. And that can increase your ability to focus cognitively. And it works. And keep in mind that focusing always involves a refocusing. We covered a beautiful data set, not collected by my lab but by Wendy Suzuki's Lab at NYU, that at roughly 10-minute, it's actually 13-minute a day meditation of the sort, where you just focus on your breathing, has been shown to improve focus significantly. Why don't we hear about this more? Well she's now Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU and all the students are hearing about it. Hopefully, they're doing it. But it takes a little bit of discipline for some reason 10-minute a day type meditation is something that very few people follow consistently. But if you're looking for non medication-based treatments for ADHD, or you're somebody who just struggles with focus, the focusing exercise or the meditation, I just subscribed it can be very useful, so say the data. Yeah, thanks for bringing up space-time bridging. Are people familiar with what space-time bridging is? I haven't talked a lot about it. OK, this is-- thanks for bringing that up. We actually have an episode on meditation coming up soon where I cover it. And I talked about it long ago and then I kind of abandoned it because well, we wanted more data and it's a pretty interesting technique. If you think about the nervous system and vision in particular, but if you're not a sighted person or you're low vision, or no vision, you could do this with your hearing. But I'm going to assume most people here are sighted. If not just translate this to the auditory system. You have this incredible ability to close your eyes and focus, for instance, on-- people talk about the third eye center, focusing right behind your forehead. Do you know why people do that when they meditate? The reason is that you actually have no sensation in your brain. It's the one place to focus your attention for which you abandon sensation. If I think about any portion of my body or my breathing, either I'm going to sense what's happening. I'm going to perceive my inner landscape, so-called interior reception, or my outer. If I look out into the world, it's external perception. When you focus your attention with your eyes closed, you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead. You are focusing on your thinking Sort of obvious, but I don't-- at least to me it never been stated that clearly. Again, one of the problems with some of the more traditional practices but also the problem with science, is that there's a shrouding of everything in very complex language, which sucks. Why is it suck? Because it's a separator. You eliminate the number of people that can be brought to potentially useful practices. And I don't like it when people, including myself, overuse mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases to mask basic principles, so simplest language I think it tends to unify people around the practices. So when you focus on this so-called third eye center, or a spot right behind your forehead or on your breath-- it's a little tricky with the breath, but when you focus on your frontal cortex, there's nothing to sense. Because there's no sensory neurons there. There's no touch. There's no pain. Nothing. That's why in these gory movies, you can take the skull off and-- while in neurosurgeries they're poking around in there, and the person's playing a violin. Like no anesthetic No anesthetic. Doesn't require anesthetic. There's no sensory neurons. You can't sense anything there. So space-time bridging involves-- it's essentially a meditation, but it's really a perceptual exercise. I think that's where we're going with this, is it starts by closing your eyes and focusing on that location for which there is no sensation. There's only thought. And then opening your eyes and focusing on a location maybe about the distance of your hand. And you focus also on your breathing. So you sort of imagine a kind of a tether between that. You can split your attention to these two locations. You're thinking about your body and you're thinking about a location outside of you. And then while continuing to think about your body, so-called intersection, focus on your breathing, you focus further out, and then further out, and then further out. And then ultimately, you know that little cartoon or meme where they're like, we're just a little blue dot floating in a big universe. And like it's supposed to make all your problems go away. It kind of works because what you've done is you've expanded your perception, and you go oh, yeah the stuff that's happening in here is really important when I'm focused on what's happening in here. But when I'm focused on what's going on and the vastness of all this, and we're just a little pale blue dot and all that, it changes your perception. Not just your visual perception obviously. Changing your visual perception changes your cognitive perception, which changes your emotional experience. So the space-time bridging is a perceptual exercise where you step from focusing internally to focusing externally at a short distance, then a further distance, further distance, further distance, and then trying to imagine yourself in this larger landscape. It sounds very mystical but it's actually very neurobiological. And it captures something really amazing. Why is the T in there-- the time? Space-time bridging, because this is space? But time is in there because when you focus in close, your slicing of time is finer. You notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing and things that are happening up close. Whereas when you focus further out, your perception of time actually changes, which is why in panoramic vision we are calm. And when you think about, we're just a pale blue dot and we mostly only live to about 85 or maybe 100 years old, and then what's happening right now, my boss being a jerk, and all that doesn't really matter because the Earth is spinning and all that kind of stuff. Which is all true. And it's the stuff of philosophy and mindfulness. And I think it's beautiful. What you're really doing is you're changing your time perception by changing your space perception. So space-time bridging is very useful because most people get locked at one step, one of these stations, especially under conditions of stress. And people who have trouble focusing-- and I'm glad you brought this up in this context of ADHD, people have a hard time focusing whether or not they have ADHD or not, tend to skip back and forth between different space-time domains, as we call them in science. So this is a simple exercise that you can do. Focusing internally then stepping out externally, and then stepping back in. All the while paying attention to your inner landscape just simply by focusing on your breathing. It's a tool that we're still collecting data on in terms of its utility, but people are already using it. And I don't think of it as a meditation. I think of it as a perceptual exercise. Thanks for asking that. As a teenager what are five things you would recommend to physically feel my best? I'm a 15-year-old surfer who attends high school and plays soccer. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things, right? To physically feel your best. So I'm going to grasp at some context here that I'm not-- that's not within reach. I'm assuming if you are doing all these things you're hopefully doing a bunch of other things too. And they're going to be demands on you that you probably some of them you don't want to do, school and things like that, are going to have varying levels of joy and delight and demand of things you don't want to do. I don't want to default always to the simplest of tools. But I certainly think that even as a 15-year-old if you're not already getting lots and lots of sleep, that's going to be great. Tell your parents that I said you should get lots and lots of sleep. provided you're not sleeping through classes, I'm a professor after all. I couldn't tell you otherwise. I would say if I could travel back in time as a 15-year-old, I would encourage you to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practice. I know this sounds a little cliche, but having some awareness of your thinking about your thinking is good. But I'm actually not going to say sit down and meditate for 10 minutes a day, or do NSDR. I'm actually not going to tell you that I think given how plastic your brain is, how much it's changing at 15, I would encourage you-- and maybe you would set a timer for this, to actually develop just a really keen awareness of what stresses you out, what relaxes you, what delights, you et cetera. And just to simply develop an awareness of that, because those are your antennae. And I certainly had a meditation practice as a youth, mostly given to me, because I was a little haywire and I needed it. And it worked pretty well. But I think in retrospect, what I wish I had developed was more of a sense of how I navigated stress or things and things I enjoyed and things I didn't enjoy. And I would just encourage you to have a general awareness. Try and detect and learn about what raises your adrenaline, what raises your dopamine, what raises your serotonin, and then start thinking about tools. But, again the awareness is going to be very valuable and gosh, as a 15-year-old you are in this amazing blessed period of heightened neuroplasticity, should we all be so lucky. So enjoy it. Next question please. Clarity on adrenaline regarding cold water. Should we wait to feel the rise of adrenaline, the "get me out of here" feeling and the fall of it before bailing? Yes, provided it doesn't kill you. I don't want to say cold water. It's hard to kill yourself with cold water, provide your head's above and you're breathing. But it's-- sorry, my podcast producer's always like, "I can't help that." Anyway, it's a great tool. And different days it'll feel different. So for instance, doing any kind of adrenaline and deliberate cold exposure, or adrenaline increasing activity early in the day, you might find that you are more "resilient" than later. In other words, the wall like, I really don't want to do this. This is actually interesting for I think it extends beyond cold water. Let's say you really don't want to do something. Pay attention to the fact that maybe it's not the right thing to do. But assuming it's something that you know you should do but you don't want to do, you are already in the first wall of adrenaline. You don't experience it necessarily as heightened levels of stress. You might experience it as heightened levels of fatigue or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state that's required to move through the thing. But I do encourage you to take advantage of that. And we have an episode coming out tomorrow actually that answers questions like, should you train if you're sick and what if you travelling. And there's context always. But I think that you do want to experience. If you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure and to be more specific the adrenaline, then you want to get to that point of I really want to get out of here, but I know I can stay in safely. But I really want to get out of here. And it's a little hard to explain, but there's just so much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes. And this sounds very kind of again, subjective and maybe a little wishy-washy. But you can realize great things about yourself in those moments. You can find insight in those moments. Also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort, not just physical but mental discomfort, is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave that you'll experience afterwards. The reason it feels so good when you get out of the ice bath and you're showered off-- I always do the warm shower after. I don't do this end on cold thing. I don't know, It just seems a little too painful. And then take a warm shower and then you feel great. And that's the surge of dopamine that we know based on a paper published in the European Journal of physiology lasts many hours, and it's a 100% to 200% increase in dopamine. It's not a subtle effect. And then people say, wait, is that dopamine going to crash my dopamine system? No, because it's a nice slow rise. In fact, I am actually not aware of many things besides love and delight that can create this long, slow arc of dopamine lasting many hours. Maybe you're aware of other things. If you are, let me know. But it turns out that long arc is a true anti depressant. And my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke who's the head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic has talked about in her amazing book Dopamine Nation about patients of hers that have really helped themselves along and out of the more depressive phases of working through addiction and in just depression in general through directed cold water therapy. So I'm obviously a fanatic about it in the sense that it's a powerful relatively safe, if done properly. Safe, if done properly, way to modulate your internal dopamine. Hopefully, I answered your question. Next question please. Sorry, I caught it raised it went off the fall, as well. Yes, I think you should get out once you've accomplished something. Don't get out when you panic unless it's dangerous, sorry. How can you train your brain to feel more confident moments where you tend to feel intimidated? OK, these are hard question. Because context is tricky here, because I don't know what the context is. And confidence on short time scales, and then long time scales, so confidence in school, confidence in career, those are long arc things. Whereas confidence to be able to do something in the short term is different. But remember those action sequences that trigger the release of dopamine. I've mainly talked about the dark side of dopamine, but I hopefully also talked about the sort of upward spiral that dopamine can cause, mainly by thinking about delight and things that you really enjoy. That carries over. And I would say that you want to micro slice the demands of what's maybe got you back on your heels a bit. Actually a good friend of mine who's here tonight, I think also my friend Pat, he has a great way of conceptualizing this, which is for most all endeavors we either feel back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Like we can really do something, we're flat footed, we're back on our heels. And sometimes getting from back on our heels, lets call that lack of confidence to just on two feet, and confident enough to move forward or at least stay in the game. That's going to require you could lean on different tools. I can't say which would be ideal for the circumstance you have in mind. But I do think that having a way to calm yourself will give you access to more internal resources. We know this. This was something I meant to bring up during the discussion about fear versus love, et cetera, trying to access delight and love. When we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety, the rule set, the options available to us, and indeed our creativity, is greatly diminished. And this has to do with the way that the prefrontal cortex interacts with an area of the brain called the insula, which relates to our internal landscape. And there's this weird phenomenon, which is that normally, our brain-- our thinking brain and our rule setting brain can-- it leads the brain parts that control and pay attention to how we feel internally. And that's why for instance, if you feel a little nervous you can still do something. At some point you get stressed enough. And we know this from work by my colleague David Spiegel, it reverses. And these areas of the brain that are paying attention like how flushed my face is, or whether or not I'm sweating, or my breathing, actually start to shut down creative decision making. So I would say the way to have more confidence is to learn to control that stress and keep the part of your brain. The prefrontal cortex is that part that can come up with new rules that can be funny that can be creative. That keeps that brain part leading. The way to think about this is, the prefrontal cortex is sort of like the coach, and the rest of your brain are sort of like the players. And if you get too stressed, the players start to lead the game and the coach follows, and kind of drags them along. So I would encourage you to focus on real-time stress modulation, and to raise your stress threshold using the sorts of tools we talked about. And to register your wins. I didn't get into this in too much detail, but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system is that it's highly subject to your interpretation. If you tell yourself that a fail was a win, and you can see or conceptualize some way in which that's actually true, you get to tap into the dopamine system. You might think that's crazy. You can cheat your own brain. You can cheat your own neurochemistry. And indeed you can. You can change the time, space-time reference. And we see this with examples like Nelson Mandela or Viktor Frankl. You read their stories trapped in little cells, confined, imprisoned. And they come up with new ways to access the dopamine system by now not thinking about what they're not getting, but thinking about what they can control in their immediate experience. Many examples of this throughout literature and history. And the dopamine system is the life force system. I don't say that in any loose way. Dopamine is life force. It's the wish and the desire to continue. It's persistence. And so if you can think about what might seem like a failure and really spend some time thinking about not the potential wins on the outside, but how you can conceptualize that as a potential win internally, you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win. And that chemical win sets you up for more real wins, hopeful that make sense. It's incredible how contextualize the dopamine system is. But if it weren't, why would it matter if we're talking about money or mates or food or job or school? You don't get 50 reward systems and motivation systems. You get one, and that's the dopamine system. Next question please. What is the competing mechanism behind bilateral eye movement, EMDR, that helps resolve psychological trauma? The competing mechanism. Well, let me try and answer as best I can. I'm not sure I understand the full extent of the question. But let me-- EMDR, moving your eyes from side to side, right? And then recounting a trauma is a very common and actually one of the four approved treatments that are behavioral for trauma. So it's taken seriously in the psychiatric and psychological community for good reason. It tends to work best for single event traumas as opposed to entire childhoods. No joke there. Some people have their entire childhood that was traumatic. Other people they experience a single event trauma or repeated periods of the same or similar type of trauma. Eye movements from side to side have been shown in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity of a brain structure called the amygdala, which most people are familiar with, because of the character from the Star Wars movie, Amygdala. There's a neuroscientist somewhere on that team. It is indeed a threat detection center and when you move through space, not outer space, but when you walk like this your eyes actually generate these subtle side to side shifts, unless you're focusing on a specific target. And my lab and other laboratories have found that leads to a very potent quieting of the threat detection system. And then EMDR is essentially a process of pairing that calmer state with no threat detection system activated with the recount of something that normally would be quite triggering. So you've heard of Pavlovian conditioning, like a bell rings and the animal gets fed and animal salivate eventually, just the bell will evoke the salivation. You're doing the reverse of that. It's called behavioral desensitization. It has an underlying mechanism, et cetera. But the idea is to pair a calm state with recount of something. It has been shown to be successful. There are people who think that the side to side eye movements and the recount of trauma may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis. My colleague David Spiegel's an expert in clinical hypnosis, has appeared on my podcasts, Rituals podcasts and a few other podcasts. And talks about, this it is not stage hypnosis, it's clinical hypnosis. So there may be something going on there. EMDR-- again, some people get great relief from it. Other people don't. What's kind of nice is that this eye movements from side to side or simply taking a walk as long as you're not looking at your phone and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side, is a very good way to shut down the fear and stress system. So taking a walk I think is relaxing for obvious reasons. And there are data showing that part of the reason why animals scratch at the door and want to go for a walk may not actually be the exercise. There's kind of an anxiety and then an anxiety relief that occurs. Of course, they have to go to the bathroom too. One of Costello's great joys in life was just peeing on everything outdoors, thankfully. So the psychological trauma rewiring, unfortunately there haven't been a lot of brain imaging studies looking at this long term of how well EMDR works. What I think is going to happen in the next few years by the way, is it is not going to be a discussion around, should you do EMDR, should you do transcranial magnetic stimulation, should you do behavioral therapy? It's going to be combination therapies. Combination therapies, including pharmacologic manipulations to essentially give a boost to the systems that encourage neuroplasticity, like dopamine and serotonin and adrenaline. And then also then perform EMDR. And if you want to talk about what's happening in the landscape of clinical trials on some of the psychedelics, I'm happy to talk about it. They're still illegal, but they are being used in clinical trials. And very interesting stuff is happening there. OK, next question please. What new research or interventions are you most excited about in the realm of health and wellness? So what I think is going to be very interesting in the next few years really reflects my memory obsession that you've seen a little bit of tonight. But the thing that I think is going to be most useful-- and I've seen this in science before and I think we're going to see it in health and wellness. It's that there are all these tools and all these people, and he's saying this and she's saying that. But what, we're going to start paying attention to is, what are the common themes? And a broader and more important theme is going to be one of modulation versus mediation. What do I mean? Well, if someone were to pull a fire alarm right now, and please don't, that will shift our attention and make it hard to focus on what I'm saying. And knowing me I'd probably just stay up here talking. Do we think that fire alarms mediate attention? No, they modulate it. If it were very cold in this room like it was when we first got here tonight, or arctic cold-- hopefully it's warmed up a bit. It has and I'm so sorry. So sorry. Yeah, I attempted to-- yeah. I almost thought maybe we all just do a bunch of breathing to heat up like adrenaline release. But these days getting groups of people to all breathe on each other is not exactly a-- I can see that might go the wrong way in terms of what people interpret. So the idea here is that certain things directly mediate something. Like a physiological side directly calms you down quickly. It mediates the calming response. Getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered. It modulates stress. But is sleeping directly mediating stress control? No, and I think this is really important. And this brings up the topic of the gut-brain axis. The gut is rich with these little bugs, bacteria trillions of them, which is an eerie thought to me. But also the surface of your skin, the surface of your eyes, you have a skin microbiome, a nasal microbiome. Every mucosal lining has a microbiome. In fact, think about this. This is a crazy but worthwhile tangent. Have you ever bitten the inside of your mouth? It sucks, right? And you get cut and it hurts. But guess what, the inside of your mouth heals without a scar. Think about that. Weird, right? You cut anywhere else on your body, and depending on how well you heal, and your age and your immune status, you get a scar. Your mouth is filled with bacteria and it's open to the world, but the gut microbiome, provided it's healthy, provides an incredible ability to heal quickly. And I'm not somebody who's done a lot of acupuncture. I went a few times. And now there's interesting science happening on acupuncture. But what's the first thing they do when you walk in there? Let me see your tongue. And then they go oh, yeah. And they have this cool intuition that's not based on Western mechanistic science. It's more of an intuition based on millions, if not billions of data points that have been put into these charts. It's pretty cool. And what they are looking at, I believe and from what my colleagues who work on microbiome tell me is, they can look at the pallor of your tongue, in particular in the back and get a sense of whether or not the microbiome there is of the appropriate stuff. But they don't go, oh, lactobacillus. Remember this all end to illness, right? But then, Oh you're just biotic. Instead they get a sense. Now, parents of small babies learn to detect all sorts of things coming out of essentially every orifice of the child as a readout of health because the child doesn't have language. And a dog owners unfortunately you want to do this too, for better or for worse. Probably for better, right? So we have this intuition about gut health. But gut health would be another example, where it's very clear now that fiber can be helpful but it's mostly consuming these fermented foods that have been used for ages. But low sugar fermented foods of the natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, et cetera, all these things depending on which culture you're in, they come in different forms. Certain yogurts, et cetera, that allow the gut to be healthy. And it modulates a huge number of systems. So I don't think that you're going to cure depression by adjusting your gut microbiome. But if your gut microbiota are not well, and you improve that, it will indeed shift the neurotransmitter systems of your brain and give you a elevated mood. That shouldn't come as a surprise anymore. But I think that the whole world thinks like, gosh it must be the serotonin in the gut. No, it's actually not serotonin gut. It's that the gut microbiota create chemicals that actually become serotonin in the brain, or become dopamine in the brain. And so I think that the gut microbiome, I would put in the same category, although not quite as important. I would put it in the category of like sleep. It modulates a huge number of other processes. It doesn't mediate them. , So sunlight, sleep, healthy gut microbiome, exercise, good nutrition, social connection, these things all create this general milieu or environment of health. I would like to see more distinction between modulating and mediating effects and tools out there, because I also see a lot of unnecessary argument. People are like, there's no example that improving your gut microbiome cures depression. Of course there's not. But there are really good examples. If your gut microbiome is off that improving it can improve mood, which depending on where you are on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things. So I think that the future of health, we hear so much about personalized medicine and matched to your genome. But we don't even have the basic. Most people don't even have the basics right. And if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough, hopefully certain themes start to repeat themselves. But a key theme that you learn in science, you teach your students, does it modulate or does it mediate it? You need to be careful with your language there. And there's great information, or as we say, interpretation power there. If you understand the difference then I think we can go a long way by making that distinction modulating versus mediating. There are probably other things that modulate health that I'm overlooking now just because of the flow that I'm in. The CoolMitt. Yeah, the CoolMitt. Palmer cooling. OK, I promised to talk about Palmer cooling. Well, I'll do it now. Palmer cooling they changed the Q&A format. What can I say, this is like teaching in the classroom. All right, very briefly. The Palmer cooling, which is essentially placing-- you can cool the core of the body most quickly by placing cold objects on the hands, the bottoms of the feet, or on the top of the face, because of the arrangement of vasculature. Normally, you've got this arteries, capillaries, veins things, but at those locations in the body, you skip the capillaries and you can basically-- you're not really passing cooling the body, but you're cooling off the core of the body more quickly. And, if you do that in between sets of exercise or during a run or cycling you can dramatically increase your ability to continue. I actually use the CoolMitt for cognitive work. But you don't need a CoolMitt. Sorry, guys. You can just get a thing of ice water or just very cold water. And I know it sounds trivially easy, but you're actually just cooling your core by putting your hands or even one hand on a relatively cold thing of water or ice. But not so cold that it constricts the vasculature there. This is the incredible work of my colleague at Stanford Dr. Craig Heller. Why wouldn't more people do this if you can double the amount of endurance? Believe it or not. Or double the number of sets of exercise you can do or feel more alert and do more cognitive work. Why wouldn't more people do it? Because people just don't do it. And it sounds crazy. It really sounds crazy, but it's a real thing. And I wish more people would do it. The athletes at Stanford do it. People in the military do it. So people who know and they use it, enjoy it. It's just it's almost like seems to off target from what you're trying to accomplish. I don't know, for some reason, people are finally onboard breathing like in a specific way as a useful tool. A few years ago no one was into that. I mean, just think of how far we've come. It's incredible. People are talking about psychedelics, meditation, breathing. I think the pandemic for all its pains and, you know, what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons, did wake people up to the idea that you have to take control over your health, because there's no magic fairy coming to do it for you. And with all due respect there's no government agency that's going to drop off the kit at your front door of like, here's how you take good care of yourself. So it just not going to happen. And it wouldn't happen under any circumstances. So it's a personal responsibility issue. All right. What lessons from skateboarding? The failure part. The failure, failure, or failure. I mean, for me skateboarding-- never was a good skateboarder. I still have close friends in that community and our photographer and a guy who does all the visuals and the other guys do the visuals for our podcast, Mike Blabac, Chris, and Martin, all of that community. I think that for me that community was really-- as Mike will sometimes say, skateboarders hate everything, meaning they have a very high threshold for what they consider acceptable. It's not just what you do. It's how you do it. Super important. And I think in neuroscience, there are a lot of-- there's a lot of stuff. In science in general, there are so many papers and there are so many experiments. How do you navigate that landscape? I think it helped me develop a sense of taste. But the taste that I'm referring to is not necessarily a taste of which science is cool or not cool. That too, but it came through a few times tonight when I was talking about my mentors. I picked back then skateboarding because I really liked the people. And also you didn't need your parents to go to a game. And so that worked for me. And you could kind of make your own schedule. And I do think it's very important to the extent that you can, in science and in everything, to surround yourself with the kinds of people that you just really enjoy being around. And so to me, the podcast, running a lab, feels a lot like skateboarding. It's the same energy. It's the same neurochemical systems firing, so that's-- yeah, that one. Next? Favorite Feynman. Oh, I know that's inappropriate. I do have a Feynman story, but it's inappropriate. Darn it. Damn. Maybe some time. This is why I don't drink. Good decision making. Well, I read all of Feynman's books. So I had the pleasure I never met him. He was dead before I was born. But my dad did. And he had good Feynman stories and they were inappropriate. So the cool thing about Feynman was that he didn't really care if people understood the specifics of what he was talking about. He just wanted people to get turned on to how amazing physics was. And he loved general principles. And one of the things-- the example that sometimes given out. I don't know how many of you're familiar with the Feynman books. But surely, you're joking Mr Feynman or what do you care what other people think, all of that stuff it's wonderful. He picked locks. When he worked at Los Alamos Labs, they were working on the bomb. And he basically-- well, there and elsewhere. And every morning the offices used to come in and he would spread all the top secret papers out on the floor. He would break into the safes at night. And then they were perplexed who could do this. And he liked safe cracking. Literally like national security secrets just for fun, prankster. He also bongo drummed naked on the roof of Caltech. And he did most of his writing of theorems in strip clubs, in fact. Learnt to draw late in life, was really into flotation tanks, and very curious about but never did psychedelics. That's as I understand. But one of the cool Feynman factoids is that when he was a kid, he talks about when he was a child that his dad used to take him birdwatching. And he'd say, oh, well that's a whatever scrub jay and that's whatever thrush and that's the-- and his dad said, no don't cloud your mind with naming and taxonomy. That's not meaningful. Because then what if it's different? The pigmy thrush or the lesser or this or that. The more important thing is to start to identify principles of why certain birds behave one way and certain birds behave another. And to start finding the commonalities and the regularities. And that's a theme that I obviously tonight have tried to impose. And it's actually something that I can't do in podcasts, necessarily because I can't thread across 40 episodes. Or something like that in the same way that I could in an evening like this. So that's an appropriate Feynman story. Also he just seemed like a delightful guy. And he's kind of cool. He's a little bit street, he had the thick accent. He was from Far Rockaway, but he didn't really care much what people thought, or he did and he pretended he didn't. Care for when people tell you they don't care what people think. I think he did to the extent that it still allowed him to get the message out there. OK, next question please. My horse. Wow. I love this. I delight in all things animals, but especially horses, because my high school girlfriend had a horse. And they do that thing where people go, oh you know, horses can detect how-- they know more about you than you know. And then I get onto the horse, and the horse like this this and this. And it's like a litmus test. Having a girlfriend with a horse was very intimidating for me actually. I felt like I had to compete with the horse. She spent all this time with the horse, it's very large. Anyway, eventually I broke the horse. OK, my horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stressed guy. Warm blood? Yeah, warm blood. I used to work at the barn. I used to shovel manure and work at the barn. She brought her horse to college. . I actually followed her off to college I never would have gone to college if she hadn't gone to college. And the horses are interesting animals. They do tell you a lot. The horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stress guy. Do you suppose this physiological stress regulator transcends species? Absolutely. In fact, I mentioned warm blood. I have a colleague at Stanford and she's amazing. Her name is Sue McConnell and she is an expert in dog genetics, so you can imagine I'm always asking her questions. And we talk about dogs and we talk about horses because she also-- I thinks she raises warm bloods. And you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods. And also, if you have any familiarity with dogs, there are dogs like Costello, or like a nuclear bomb could go off and Costello might open an eye. That's the bulldog, economy of effort. They're not going to get activated unless there's a reason to do it. They are very, as we call it, parasympathetic dominant. That seesaw of autonomic arousal is just really relaxed. Getting them into action is more of an effort. There are other animals like the whippet or the Italian greyhound. Like they're always cold, that are very sympathetic dominant. And then of course, within a breed or within a species there's a range. And humans also, are within a range. I think anyone who's had children will tell you he or she has been like this since birth. Calm, easygoing, or like really easily stressed. I think that seesaw, we didn't get into tonight too much. But there's a concept with the autonomic regulation of a hinge. So don't think so much about being really stressed out or really relaxed. But certain animals, the hinge is tighten so that the seesaw just kind of tilts mellow like Costello. A bulldog almost seems like a different animal than a whippet. They're so very different. And within the category of horses-- and I'm not an expert in horse genetics, but they are selected for not just for their physical attributes, but for their psychological or temperament attributes. And you see this in dogs too. In fact, the reason I picked Costello, and Elvis can verify the stories, I read-- I wanted a dog for so many years. And I went there and there were all these puppies. And I was like I heard you need to take them in the other room one by one. And then if it barks for its siblings, you're like, oh it's a healthy puppy. So I walk in and all the dogs are running around like crazy. It was right around Christmas time, right Elvis? And they're running around and then there's one in the back. And he's taking advantage of the fact that all the other ones are running. He's just eating out of all of their bowls. And I was like, I want that one. So I took that chubby little bastard in the next room and I thought, OK, he's going to bark for his siblings. And he lay down and he took a nap. And I was like, this one. I want this one. Why did I want that one? Well, this completes the principle which is, I wanted a dog like that because I'm not like that. And I was very interested in a dog I could take care of, but also a dog that would help regulate my nervous system. And so for me having a dog like that as opposed to a whippet or something that was going constantly around is a very calming effect. And to this day memory of his snoring still puts me to sleep. So I think that your horse probably has-- it kind of idles a little bit higher. Think about the rpm. You know, revs a little bit higher at a given speed-- more rpm at a given speed. That's the way I think about the autonomic system. How do you reset that? Well, this is why a lot of exercise is good, right? And certainly my girlfriend's horse was crazy. It was gelded late. And it was crazy. I almost said nuts but that's like a bad pun so it was not nuts but it was crazy. It was gelded late. Next question. Is there any science behind staying motivated or developing discipline? Oh, so this represents the higher tier of where I think things are going to go in the next few years, where we're going to start seeing this convergence of psychology and biology, where we can get to these harder concepts. I like to think that we can stay motivated through a simple process that now will make sense to you. Because the last thing I covered was toggling back and forth between our ability to be gritty and linen, kind of in friction, maybe even a little anger, fear, competitiveness, et cetera. That kind of grinding in. But that the more sustaining fuel, the sort of hybrid version, a hybrid fuel model would be one in which you can access that. But that's a depletable and not so renewable resource without a lot of rest. Meaning, working hard out of anger, determination, and kind of grit will work, but when you are depleted you have to stop for a long while. Whereas if you can access this delight system, which is really one of dopamine and serotonin, both. In other words, and I want to think of a different way to put this, but to try and think about what sorts of things and tools allow you to be and feel most loving, I know it sounds weak. But it's anything but weak to be most loving in the verb sense of the word toward what you're doing. I actually used to use this trick in college when I'd encounter a topic I hated. I would tell myself I'm really-- I'm just going to fall in love with this by trying to find the gems within it. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. But the wish to do it that way as opposed to OK, I'm just going to grind this out, at least for me at the time was a powerful tool. So motivation and-- discipline is a tricky one. That's sort of the just do it thing. You need tools to modulate your stress and to get your sleep-- do all the basic things right. Set the right context for you to be in your best chance of being disciplined. And that itself is its own form of discipline. But in terms of continual motivation you're not going to manage to go against the grain for very long. People have managed to go against challenge for a very long time-- for a very long times. In fact, I was reading recently about the psychology of people who've been kidnapped. And they have this odd trick that they used. Have you heard about this is sort of like Stockholm syndrome? But they actually convinced themselves to fall in love with their captors. And then they come up with new ways to escape them, which is kind of cool. So there's something about mentally feeling like you're trying to go from back on your heels to flat footed. That's very energetically costly. So again, these systems are very susceptible to what we call context or top down regulation. Hopefully that helps. I know it's a little bit abstract. I wish I could give you a 1-minute exercise or make you motivated. But we do talk about tools to get adrenaline going and things like that. But spend some time thinking about what would allow you to sustain effort through positive feelings. It's not a light concept at all. Next question please. What would be your biggest piece of advice for achieving one's dreams? Boy! That's a tough one. Again, this is going to be a little abstract. I'm a believer in this idea kind of a seed message. Robert Greene has talked a lot about this, that we can all kind of think back to a event or stage of our life. Typically it's before puberty for other reasons that are kind of interesting. But where we delight in something. So for me it was fish. And obviously now I don't need to work on fish. It wasn't about the fish. I hope that came through. I mean aquaria are really cool, but it's not about the fish. It was something about the way they moved. It was something about the way that it tickled my excitement. I used to get dropped off at this little pet shop in California Avenue called Monette's Pet Shop. And my mom used it as childcare. She would drop me off there and I had this book and I would log all the tropical fish, and which ones could be with which ones, and then I would-- I was obsessed. But for me it was something about organizing and being able to make reliable predictions. It was about parsimony. It was about principles as opposed to-- and the colors delighted me and all that kind of stuff. The equipment delighted me, but then I hit puberty. And then it was something else. And then I went to college and it was something else. And I got a girlfriend and it was something else. So it changes over time. But this is why I recommend to that young 15-year-old person that they learn to tap into that sense of like Oh, this is cool. Like this feels cool. I know not everyone else thinks it's cool. Maybe they do. Like this feels good. I actually have a somatic experience of this. I'm not a very semantically oriented person. I'm more up here. But I actually know if I'm on to something, if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting, it's like I want to move or like some people-- you can start to identify ways in which you suddenly have this positive energy. It's not a fear energy. It's almost like a magnetism to things. And just don't be confused or misdirected in thinking that it's that thing. It's that energy or that attraction to something that feels right that is your-- I wish we had these divining rod to find water. That's your tool. It's like antennae, you want to grow your antennae. So how do you follow your dreams? Well, I never thought I'd do a podcast. I never thought I'd become a neuroscientist. You have to be willing of course, to take risks and to iterate quickly, but not so quickly that you fail out of the game, et cetera, if you do get back in, et cetera. But it's really about developing an awareness. Now, the key thing is you're not going to find this by going up a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion to just kind of rock it in, or piano fall onto your head. It's not going to happen that way. You have to interact with the sensory world and different kinds of people. And you have to be a little bit of a adventurer in a safe way, of course. An adventure and learn to recognize the signals. And some people are very in tune with this. There's an amazing podcast with Rick Rubin recently on Joe Rogan's Podcast where he talks about the creative processes. Kind of this-- it seems like whatever's going on in that beard of his just connects to the world. And he can just like-- there, that's where you need to go and that's-- But that's part of the magic, is you don't really know. And because it's all energetic-- it's all energetic. And when I say energetic, I don't mean in the mystical sense. I mean you have to learn to sense those fluctuations in energy. Some people can sense them very easily because they're very mellow. And if something gets them really excited they notice as a big delta, as we say in science, big change. Other people they ride kind of high all the time. And so everything is exciting to them, and they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations in what's really special and right for them. In fact, mania is characterized by hyper elevated levels of dopamine and everything is a good idea. And depression is the opposite. Nothing is a good idea. Nothing's going to work. And those are the extremes. And those are rough conditions obviously. But for most people, it's about learning to detect those subtle fluctuations. And every time-- every single time you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft and doing well in life-- there are a lot of people who are exceptional at their craft, but not necessarily doing well on the whole. Those people have a kind of intuition about what feels good to them. This year's Nobel Prize winner in chemistry is my colleague, Carolyn Bertozzi. And all I know of her, except the fact that she's an amazing chemist, is they did this interview with her. And she said that when everyone would go out in college she was finding excuses to stay home and read organic chemistry. Now, that to me sounds like a bad night. But for her it was pure delight. And she's wired for that. And I think her work is going to be vitally important and transformative for humanity. I really do. So how do you succeed in chasing your dreams? You succeed in identifying what they are. But you don't know at the outset. You want to find the energy to find the right path and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly be off your path. That's essentially what I've done. I still look for the feeling of delighting in Costello or the cuttlefish. That's what I'm looking for. It's not a template I have to match, but that's my like, oh, yeah I know what that feels like. It's like a texture. It's like if you think about a bunch of different textures of sandpaper, it's like this one that just feels really good. And so you're comparing everything to that, because the system that involves all these chemicals, you'll find it if you learn to pay attention to it. But you won't find it sitting, staring at your belly button or going up a mountain. You have to be in sensory experience in order to find it. Reflection is good but you need to get into action. Wow. All right well. OK, so psilocybin. Opinion of the psychedelics. Generally, we just had an episode with my colleague Nolan Williams, who's a triple board certified neurologist psychiatrist. It's a fun thing about working at Stanford. It's also very humbling because you're like, whoa who are these people? They have three board certifications. The psilocybin-- first of all, not for everybody. People with psychosis, it is still illegal decriminalized in certain places. So obviously the cautionary notes people who have drug addiction issues or other kinds of addiction issues need to be thoughtful about diving into a neurochemical landscape like that. But it does appear that the clinical trials on one macro dose. This is what's interesting to me. A lot of people talk about micro-dosing psilocybin, but the data at least according to Matthew Johnson, who is also on the podcast, the data for micro-dosing are not really there, frankly. The data on single session macro dose, the sort of heroic doses that have been talked about in the psychonaut community for a depression and to some extent PTSD, and for eating disorders and sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging. In fact, the current data suggests that about 2/3 of people achieve lasting relief from one session. Now, keep in mind those are guided sessions with physicians in the room, et cetera. I do think there's a potential hazard of all psychedelics, which is they alter-- this includes MDMA or especially MDMA, they alter the chemical landscape in you, such that a lot of things can serve as attractors in that state. Meaning you can get really into the sound of music in an MDMA session, feel connected to that, and waste the opportunity for some more meaningful transformative rewiring. And I do think that's worth paying attention to. So that's the usefulness of having a therapeutic guide, as they can continually steer you back to what at least for you is the more meaningful work. But it's very encouraging. And Nolan Williams, who I trust, is again triple board certified M.D. Said that in the studies of lifetime perceived individual and societal risk, of all the compounds out there except for caffeine, psilocybin is at the bottom of the list. Whereas things like heroin, cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine sit at the top of the list. Actually, alcohol quite high on that list at certain amounts of consumption. So I'm very excited about what's happening in the landscape of psilocybin, but I'm not so excited about the micro-dosing data. Very excited about the single heroic dose data. One interesting thing there perhaps, what seems to be the unifying feature of a successful psilocybo-- psilocybin, excuse me session, is that at some point the person feels as if it's like too much of a autonomic thing. It kind of get to this point and then they are encouraged to "let go." And I'm fascinated by this concept of letting go, because I'm a neuroscientist. We don't know what that means, but it seems like being able to ride the wave of autonomic arousal from top to bottom. Seems to be very powerful for trauma and depression treatment. And this is interesting. A lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans nowadays is we're stressed about a lot of things. But we never actually get to go into the full stress response, and then let it relax again. And catharsis was big at one point. Scream therapy, Steve Jobs is going to scream therapies. That whether or not catharsis is healthy or not has been debated but the data are kind of pointing to the fact that it may be provided that the catharsis is not. Obviously someone damaging themselves for somebody else. So maybe we should all be screaming a lot more. Why does my desire to eat disappear after I use the sauna? Oh, interesting. I can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat. I can only speculate. The sauna or any kind of deliberate heat exposure that's uncomfortable releases this molecule dynorphin. This is actually the same molecule that's released under conditions of alcohol withdrawal. It makes you feel agitated and not good. And then there's this rebound. The way it feels good is later, it causes this upregulation in the so-called mu opioid receptors. So the chemicals that you have, your so-called endogenous opioids, not the opioids that are related to the opioid crisis. But the ones that you naturally make are able to have a more robust effect after the sauna. Dynorphin is an appetite suppressant and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort in the body. So that's the only reason I can speculate. There are a number of other things that sauna does including massive increases in growth hormone provided you don't sauna too much. So if you do it once a week four 20-minute sessions spaced five minutes apart, you get these enormous increases in growth hormone. If you start doing it more often you get still significant, but smaller increases in growth hormone. And my team, this is how the podcast goes too. At some point Rob just goes, it's enough. So if you think the episodes are long now, they'd be a lot longer. Listen, I just want to-- before we part, I know it's a Sunday night and people have to go, I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight. I know that at least for me I'm still sort of baffled, but pleasantly so that people are interested in investing time to come out and hear hours of a nerd like me and talk about science and tools. And I'm delighted that people are hopefully gleaning some useful information. Please do pass along the information. I didn't invent this stuff as I mentioned before. I was not consulted on the design phase. I have no domain over it. This is the stuff of mother nature. And whatever other beliefs you have, they're here in us. And of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't finish by saying, have a wonderful night and thank you for your interest in science. AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Layne Norton. Dr. Norton is one of the foremost experts in protein metabolism, fat loss, and nutrition. He did his degrees in biochemistry and nutritional sciences and is considered one of the world experts in understanding how we extract energy from our food and how exercise and what we eat combine to impact things like body composition and overall health. Today, we discuss an enormous number of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness, including, for instance, what is energy balance? That is, how do we actually extract energy from our food? We also discuss the somewhat controversial topic of artificial sweeteners, whether or not they are safe or not and whether or not they are an effective tool for weight loss, in particular, for people suffering from obesity and different types of diabetes. We also talk about gut health-- that is the gut microbiome-- and how it's impacted by food and how it can actually impact the metabolism of the foods that we eat. We also discuss fasting, or so-called intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, what it does and what it does not do in terms of how effective it is for weight loss and, perhaps, even for health and longevity. We also talk about protein and define very clearly how much protein each and all of us need, depending on our daily activities and life demands. We discuss the various types of diets that you've probably heard about, including ketogenic diets, vegan diets, vegetarian diets, and pure carnivore diets, as well as more typical omnivore diets, and how to make sure that you get all of the essential amino acids that are critical for healthy weight maintenance, weight loss, or directed muscle gain. We also talk about supplements, in particular, the supplements for which there is an immense amount of science pointing to their safety and efficacy for fitness and for overall body composition. What I'm sure will become clear to you, as you hear Layne talk about each and every one of these topics, is that he has an incredible ability to both understand the mechanistic science but also the real world applications of the various discoveries that are made in particular papers and, in particular, in the randomized controlled trials. That is when a given scientific hypothesis has been raised. He's extremely good at understanding why it was raised but also at evaluating whether or not it works in the real world, which is what I believe most everybody out there is concerned with. I think this is one of the things that really distinguishes him from the other voices in the nutritional landscape. I assure you that by the end of today's discussion, you will have a much clearer understanding about what the science says about nutrition, about fitness, and about how different diets and fitness programs combine to achieve the results that you want. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing that you don't. That means it contains sodium, potassium, and magnesium, the so-called electrolytes, but no sugar. As you may have heard me discuss before on this podcast, every cell in our body, and in particular cells within our brain, the so-called neurons or nerve cells, critically rely on the presence of electrolytes-- sodium, magnesium, and potassium-- in order to function properly. I, myself, am a big believer in consuming electrolytes any time I've been sweating a lot, so that could be after during exercise or after doing the sauna. So by drinking electrolytes in the form of LMNT electrolyte mix, I'm able to replenish those electrolytes and maintain mental clarity and energy throughout the day. LMNT contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. If you'd like to try an LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt-- spelled L-M-N-T-- .com/huberman to get a free sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkL-M-N-T.com/huberman to get the free sample pack. Today's, episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford. And everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly, for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or often to the distance. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling. And indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, they also have a terrific aesthetic and they can be used just as well for wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to roka-- that's R-O-K-A-- .com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's roka-- R-O-K-A-- .com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition program that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. Now, I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One of the major issues with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about levels of hormones, levels of lipids, levels of metabolic factors, but you don't know what to do about that information. With InsideTracker, they have an easy-to-use platform that allows you to assess those levels and then determine what sorts of behavioral changes and nutritional changes, maybe, even supplementation changes you might want to make in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTrackers plans. Again, that's inside tracker Huberman to get 20% off. The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with Momentous supplements. To find the supplements we discuss on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S-- livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now, for my discussion with Dr. Layne Norton. Layne, Dr. Norton, thank you so much for being here. This is a long time coming. And I have to say, I'm really excited because I've seen you in the social media sphere. I've also listened to a number of your other podcasts. And as a fellow PhD scientist, I feel a great kinship with you. I know you have tremendous experience in fitness and nutrition, a number of areas. We also got a lot of questions from our audience. And I'm really looking forward to talking with you today. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, I'm excited, too. I mean, like you said, it's been something we've been talking about for a long time. So I was glad we were able to make it happen. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, indeed. And I think some of the audience has requested a debate or a battle. And I can tell you right now, it's not going to happen. Actually, one of the things that brought Layne and I together, in conversation online and then via text, et cetera, was the fact that I love to be corrected, and that's what happened. I did a post about artificial sweeteners, which we will talk about a little bit later in the episode, and Layne pointed out some areas of the study that I had missed or, maybe, even misunderstood. And I revised my opinions and I think it's wonderful. And other studies have come out since then. So hopefully, our conversation will serve as a message of how science and actionable science can be perceived and that it doesn't always have to be a battle. But hey, if we get into it, we get into it. It won't get physical because we know you would win. So in any case, I'd like to start with something that's rather basic and yet can be pretty complex, and that's this issue of energy balance and energy utilization. I think most people have heard of a calorie. I am assuming that most people don't actually know what that is in terms of how it works, what it represents. And so maybe you could just explain for people what happens when we eat food, of any kind, and how is that actually converted into energy, as a way of framing up the discussion around weight loss, weight maintenance, weight gain, and body composition. LAYNE NORTON: So it's a great question. And like you said, this is one of those things where people use the term calories in, calories out, and they say, well, that's way too simplistic. I'm like, if you look at what actually makes up calories in, calories out, it's actually very complicated. So let's deal with what you mentioned first. What is the calorie? Because I think a lot of people don't quite understand this. So a calorie just refers to a unit of energy, of heat specifically. And so what does that have to do with food? What does that have to do with what we digest and eat? Really, what you're talking about is the potential chemical energy that is in the bonds of the macronutrients of food. And by digesting, assimilating, and metabolizing those nutrients, we are able to create energy and the in-product of that, mostly, is ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is your body's energy currency. So to understand ATP, just try to think about-- if you're trying to power these various reactions in your body-- and we're talking about tens of thousands of enzymes that require ATP-- it doesn't make sense that you would have to create a bunch of micro explosions. You want something that can transfer high-energy phosphates to power these reactions, to give up essentially its energy to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable. So a lot of metabolism is simply creating ATP, which the end of the line of that-- I'm going to work backwards-- is what's called oxidative respiration. So that happens in the mitochondria. Everybody's heard mitochondria, a powerhouse of the cell. And that is done through essentially creating a hydrogen ion gradient across the mitochondria, which powers the production of ATP by converting free phosphate plus ATP to ADP. Now the way that hydrogen ion gradient is created is through creating hydrogen ions that can be donated through the Krebs cycle. Now the Krebs cycle is linked to glycolysis. So if we talk about carbohydrate metabolism, carbohydrates basically, other than fructose, get converted into glucose, which can go into glycolysis, and you can produce some ATPs through glycolysis. And then it boils down to pyruvate, then acetyl-CoA, which goes to the Krebs cycle, produces a lot more ATPs from that. If you talk about protein, protein is a little bit different because protein gets converted to amino acids, which can be used for muscle protein synthesis or protein synthesis in other tissues. But it also can be converted through gluconeogenesis to glucose. And there also are some ketogenic amino acids as well. And so you can have a few different ways to get to the Krebs cycle. Either being through acetyl-CoA or through glucose going through the glycolysis to pyruvate. Then you have fatty acids, which are able to create energy through what's called beta oxidation where, essentially, you're taking these fatty acids and you're lopping them off two carbons at a time to produce acetyl-CoA which, again, can go into the Krebs cycle, produce those hydrogen ions that can then power the production of ATP. So that's kind of like at the cellular level of how this stuff works. But stepping back and taking it back out, what does that have to do with weight loss or weight gain? Well, when you think about the balance of energy in versus energy out. Sounds very simple. But let's look at what actually makes up energy in versus energy out. First of all, you've got to realize that the energy inside of the equation is more difficult to track than people think. So one, food labels, which we like to think as being from upon high, can have up to a 20% error in them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really? LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a 100 calorie-- something listed as 100 calories per serving, it could-- what's actually in there could be 80 or 120. LAYNE NORTON: Right. Exactly. So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect is there's what's called your energy, but then there's also metabolizable energy. So if you have food stuff with say, a lot of insoluble fiber, typically, insoluble fiber is not really digestible, and so you could have "quite a bit of carbohydrate," know but if you can't extract the energy from it-- and typically, this is because insoluble fiber from plant material, the carbohydrate and even some of the protein is bound up in the plant structure, which makes it inaccessible to digestive enzymes. And so this is what adds bulk to your stool and whatnot. But again, reduces the metabolizable energy in there. And there's some evidence that based on people's individual gut microbiome, that some people may actually be better at extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people. So just starting off right there, OK, there's quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things. Now, one of the things people will say is, well, see that's why you shouldn't worry about tracking calories, because the food levels can be 20% off. And what I'll say is, OK. I understand where you're coming from. But typically, if it's off, it's going to be consistently off. And if you're consistent with how you track it, eventually, you'll be able to know what you're taking in. And that's like saying, well, don't worry about tracking if you're-- I like to use financial examples. We know that to save money, you have to earn more money than you spend. Well, you can't exactly know how much money you're earning at a time because there's inflation and then there is-- if you have investments, those can be different interest rates and whatnot. It's like, OK, if you have a budget, you have a reasonable idea of what it's going to be. And you make certain assumptions, but you can relatively guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. That's a good example. LAYNE NORTON: Right. So now, let's look at the energy outside of the equation, which is actually way more complicated. And so your energy out is a few different buckets. The first one and the biggest one is your resting metabolic rate. So your RMR. And that, for most people, is anywhere from 50% to 70% of your total daily energy expenditure. Now, people use the term metabolic rate and energy expenditure interchangeably, but they're not the same thing. So your total daily energy expenditure is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Walking upstairs, exercise if you do it-- LAYNE NORTON: Fidgeting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Plus your resting metabolic rate. LAYNE NORTON: Right. So resting metabolic rate is a big part of that, but it's not the only thing. So that's usually about 50% to 70%. And sedentary people will be on the higher end of that. So it'll be a bigger proportion whereas people who are more active, it'll be a little bit lower, not because their metabolic rate is lower, but because they're expending a greater percentage of their calories from physical activity. Then you have something called the thermic effect of food, which is a relatively small percentage of your total daily energy expenditure. It's about 5% to 10%. And very difficult to measure and usually what researchers do when they're looking at this stuff is they just make an assumption about it. They use a constant. But that's about 5% to 10% of your daily energy expenditure. And that refers to the amount of energy it takes to extract the energy out of food. So think about your body like a car. You don't just have gas in your tank and it spontaneously starts up. You have to have a battery so you put in energy so you can get the energy out of the petrol that you have in your car. Similar with food, you can't just eat food and then it just appears in your cells and you start doing stuff. It has to be systematically broken down and put into forms that can actually produce energy. And so you have to put some energy in to achieve that. And a lot of times, people will say something like, well, not all calories are created equal. That's not true, because calorie is just a unit of measurement. That would be like saying not all seconds on a clock are created equal. Yes, they are. All sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So if we look at something like fat, for example, the TEF of fat is about 0% to 3%. Meaning, if you eat 100 calories from fat, your net will be about 97 to 100. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the process of breaking down that fat, essentially, subtracts some of the calories away because you used it in creating energy-- LAYNE NORTON: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --by breaking those chemical bonds to create ATP. LAYNE NORTON: Correct. Correct. So you have like, for example, some enzymes that require ATP to run these processes. Now, fat is actually the easiest thing to convert into energy. Then you have carbohydrate, which has a TEF of like 5% to 10%. So you eat 100 calories from carbohydrate. And obviously, the fiber content makes a big difference on this. But if you eat 100 calories, you'll net 92 95. Protein is about a 20% to 30% TEF. So if you eat calories from protein, you're only netting 70 to 80. Now, you're still net-- people say, well, you can't eat too much protein. Well, people will ask, well, can protein be stored as fat? The carbon's from protein it's unlikely, it's going to wind up in adipose tissue. But if you're eating a lot of protein, overall as part of a lot of calories, it has to be oxidized and it can't provide a calorie cushion for other things to be stored in fat. But protein itself does provide a net positive for calories, but less so than carbohydrate or fat. And tends to be more satiating. So again, when people talk about are all calories created equal, yes, but all sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So that's the TEF bucket and the BMR bucket. Then we go to physical activity. And physical activity is, essentially, two parts. There's exercise, which is kind of your purposeful movements like you go out for a walk, you do a training session. I mean, whatever. Any purposeful activity. And then you have what's called NEAT which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis, which I think is actually really cool. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's fascinating. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. It is. So I was actually hanging out with somebody last night and I was noticing them, they were fidgeting their feet and their fingers. And I said, have you always been pretty lean? And they were like, yeah, I never really had a problem maintaining leanness. And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype, people think they have high BMR or they exercise a lot and really what it seems to be as neat. They tend to-- if they overeat, they just spontaneously increase their physical activity. Now, people get NEAT confused. I've heard people say, well, I'm going to go out for a walk to get my NEAT up. That's not NEAT. NEAT is not something you can consciously modify. What you're doing there, if it's purposeful, it's exercise. So for example, when I'm talking, if I'm waving around my hands, if I'm tapping my feet, if I'm-- whatever. That's NEAT. But trying to get yourself-- I'm just going to tap my foot more, well, now if I'm consciously having to do this, then my focus-- I mean, you know how the brain works. Very hard to do-- you don't really do two things at once. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LAYNE NORTON: You switch quickly between tasks, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. Can I quickly ask, was the person that you were referring to our friend Ben Bruno? LAYNE NORTON: No, no. But he is fidgety too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Amazing online fitness channel. He's a freakishly strong individual. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And I can't remember whether or not, Ben, you're a fidgetter or not. But anyway, I'll have to go check and we'll measure your fidgeting. About non-exercise induced thermogenesis NEAT, my understanding of the old papers on this, old being, I guess, back to the mid '90s, is that the calorie burn from NEAT is actually pretty significant. We're not talking about 100 calories or 200 calories per day. We're talking about, in some cases, hundreds of thousand-- excuse me, hundreds to maybe even close to 1,000 calories per day. Could you elaborate on that? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So there was actually a really classic study, I think, from-- I want to say it's from Levine in 1995. It was metabolic ward study. And hopefully, I don't butcher the study because I'm trying to pull it out of my brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't expect you to have that in your head. Although, I must say, you have a quite extensive PubMed ID, grab bag in there. So-- LAYNE NORTON: I try to bring the receipts. I try to bring the receipts. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We will put a link to this study in the show note captions. So people can peruse it if they like it, yeah. LAYNE NORTON: So I believe they had people overeat. And I think it was by like 1,000 calories a day and I think for six weeks. And I mean, this is the metabolic ward. So this is very tightly controlled. It's as tight as you get. And what was interesting is, of course, on average, people gained weight and gained fat mass. But some people gained more than expected, and there was one person, in particular, who only gained like just over 1/2 a kilo. They should have gained like-- I think it was something like 3 to 4 kilos. It was predicted. And what they found is this individual just spontaneously increased their physical activity. He didn't purposefully do it, it just happened. And I mean, anecdotally, I've seen people who are, again, very lean even eat a meal, sit down, and start sweating. And be very fidgety. There was a natural bodybuilder back in the day named Jim Cordova. And this guy was just very lean all the time, and he was exactly that phenotype. He would walk up a flight of stairs and all of a sudden he's sweating. Sit down eat a meal, he's sweating. He's just-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's a furnace. LAYNE NORTON: Just expending energy. And what's very interesting about NEAT is that seems to be the most modifiable-- I mean, exercise is very modifiable because you can be intentional with that. But of BMR, TEF, and NEAT, NEAT seems to be far more modifiable. So even a bodyweight reduction of 10%, they've observed a decrease in NEAT of almost 500 calories a day for a 10% reduction in body weight. Now, you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight, one, because you're just in a smaller body now and so it takes less energy to lock them out. But also there's what's called metabolic adaptation, which is a further reduction in your BMR than expected from the loss of body mass. And that's on average usually around like 15%. But it does seem to be-- there's new evidence coming out on the metabolic adaptation from BMR. And it seems to be a little bit-- kind of in the transition phases. So if you start a diet within the first few weeks, you will have a reduction in BMR that then just-- thereafter, any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose. And then if you, like for example, finish a diet and move your calories to maintenance, within a few weeks, BMR starts to come back up. There is still a small reduction, but I used to be somebody who thought that BMR, metabolic adaptation was a big reason why people stopped losing weight or plateaued. And now, I think it's much more to do with NEAT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. And you said that it can't be conscious because that will distract us from other activities. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at this study. And I'll send it to you. Maybe I'd be fun to do a kind of an online journal club about this at some point soon. But there's a study that came out of University of Houston recently having people do, now, this is a long period of time. Four hours a day of, basically, a soleus pushup, which is basically a heel raise. A seated catchphrase with one foot not weighted. And then they looked at it a bunch of things about glucose metabolism and glucose clearance and insulin levels. And they didn't conclude that people burned a ton of calories, but what they concluded was that blood sugar regulation improved greatly. And I think, there was a lot of excitement about this at some level, but based on everything you're telling me, this fits perfectly with what's known about neat. So this fell somewhere in between with-- in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise and spontaneous movement. I guess they've tried to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious. LAYNE NORTON: Well, what I'll tell people is if you're worried about NEAT, one thing you can do, like these watches, for example where people are like, oh, well, told me I burned these many calories. They are not accurate for energy expenditure. I mean, it is like, there was a meta analysis in 2018, I want to say, between a 28% and 93% overestimation of energy expenditure by these watches. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fitness track. So for those of you listening, we're not going to name the brand. But fitness trackers-- so wrist-worn fitness trackers. LAYNE NORTON: And this is across the board. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LAYNE NORTON: So like depending on the brand, it could be more or less but, they all overestimated the amount of-- the calories you burn from exercise. So this is actually a great example where people go, well, calories in, calories out doesn't work for me, because I eat in a calorie deficit, I didn't lose weight. When I talk to them, usually, they went to an online calculator. It's a few things. They went to an online calculator, put in their information, it spat out some calories to eat, and they ate that and didn't lose weight. And it's like, well, what do you think is more likely? That you're defying the laws of conservation of energy or that you might have not gotten the right number for you? ANDREW HUBERMAN: The measurement tool was off. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. The next thing is a lot of people weigh very sporadically. And I'll tell people like, if you're going to make an intentional weight loss a goal, and again, this can be different for different people, but typically, I tell people, weigh in, first thing in the morning or after you go to the bathroom, do it every day, and take the average of that for the week. And then compare that to the next week's average. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I ask one-- sorry to interrupt, but one quick question about that when you say, go to the bathroom not to get too detailed here unnecessarily, but are you talking about urination and emptying your bowels? Ideally, because you did eat a big meal the night before. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Got it. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So wake up, use the bathroom in all forms that you're ready, and then get on the scale, take that measurement, average that across the week, and then maybe every Monday, you take that value and see how it progresses. LAYNE NORTON: All right. And the reason I recommend doing that is, if you're just sporadically weighing in, as somebody who weighs themselves pretty regularly, I mean, my weight will fluctuate 5, 6 pounds, and not seemingly changing much. And that's just-- those short term changes are fluid. So I've had it before, where week to week, my average didn't change. But between the lowest weigh in from a previous week and the highest weigh in, might have been like 8 pounds, right? So if you're somebody who just randomly is weighing in and you're eating in a calorie deficit, and you just weigh in one day where you've just whatever reason holding some more fluid, then you're oh, see, this isn't working when in reality, your average might be dropping. So that's one of the reasons, and actually, believe it or not, weight fluctuations are actually identified as a major reason why people get discouraged from weight loss. It stops the buy-in, when they have a fluctuation up. So that's one of the reasons-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great point. LAYNE NORTON: --one of the reasons early on that low carb diets tend to work really well is because people lose a lot of water weight really quickly, and they get that buy-in. So they're, oh, this is working. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We can return to that in a little bit because I have theories as to how that-- when people eat less carbohydrate, they excrete more water, and they'll see-- for the first time, they'll see some definition in their abs, oh, my God, this diet's amazing. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And the fluid loss does hold that promise. I think fluid loss can do some other things. It might make people literally feel lighter, although it can be-- it has some negative effects. I do have one quick question, and I do want-- we will return to NEAT in a moment. But when you say, the caloric burn as a consequence of exercise, I want to ask about the caloric burn during that exercise? So for instance, if somebody is on the treadmill and they'll see, OK, they burn 400 calories. Actually, I think this is a month where a number of prominent podcasters like Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan, and others, I think they call it "Sober October," but in addition to avoiding alcohol, they're burning 500 calories per day during the exercise. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're measuring it. A lot of people do this. They think-- they take track of weather-- excuse me, take stock of how many calories they burned. My understanding is that if that particular form of exercise is a muscle building form of exercise, that at some point later, there might be an increase in muscle if you did everything right, do everything right, and then you will burn more energy as a consequence of adding that tissue. That's a long process as and we will discuss. But I have heard about this post-exercise induced increase in oxidative metabolism. I'm probably not using the right language in here. So if I were to go out, for instance, and do some sprints. Run hard for a minute, jog for a minute, run hard for a minute, and do that 10 times over. Let's assume I burn 400 calories during that exercise bout. But my understanding is that in the hours that follow, my basal metabolic rate will have increased. Is that true, and is it significant enough to care about? LAYNE NORTON: So answer both of those questions. Yes, there does seem to be a small increase in metabolic rate, and no, it does not appear to be enough to actually make a difference. So when they look at-- and again, this is where I tell people-- I think I have a good perspective on this, because my undergraduate degree was a biochemistry degree. So I was very into mechanisms. You know what I mean? It was like, oh, if we just do this and this, we'll get this. And then I did nutrition as a graduate degree, and then my advisor was so great because you could do something over here and he could tell you how it would affect vitamin D metabolism over here. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is Don Lemon? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, Don Lemon. So he would always kind of say, yeah, but what's the outcome going to be, right? So this is actually one of the things I changed my mind on. Was I used to be very much, well, I think high intensity interval training is probably better because you get this post-exercise energy burn which they do see in some of these studies. But in the meta analyzes and more tightly controlled studies where they equate work between high intensity intervals and moderate or low intensity cardio, so equating work, they don't see differences in the loss of body fat. And so to me, if I'm looking like, that's the example of a mechanism, which is OK, we're seeing this small increase in basal metabolic rate, that should lead to increased loss of body fat. But again, remember, you're capturing a snapshot in time. But we don't see a difference in the loss of body fat. So what may be happening-- and again, I'm just speculating. But a way to explain it could be, you might have an increase and then you might actually have a decrease that tends to just wash it out, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. And I have to imagine some forms of exercise. This would be highly individual, but will spike appetite more than others. So for instance, if I go out for a 45-minute jog which I do. A 45 to 60-minute hike or jog once a week, I just make it a point to do that or ruck or something like that. Throw on a weight vest and hike. After that, I find I'm very thirsty, I want to hydrate. But I'm not that hungry. And that's true of all cardiovascular exercise for me. But after I weight train, about 60 to 90 minutes later, I want to eat the refrigerator. And so obviously, calories in, calories out dictates that that will play an important role as to whether or not I gain or lose weight, et cetera. So is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise that people choose needs to be taken in consideration? Calories in, calories out, so how much is burned during the exercise? Also how much that exercise tends to stimulate appetite. I don't know whether or not people explore this in their rigorous studies. And whether or not that form of exercise actually increases lean muscle mass or not. Now, we've taken exercise and split it into a number of different dimensions, but this is what you are so masterful at is really parsing how the different components work individually and together. So if you would just expand on that, I'd love to know what you're thinking. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So this is actually a really fascinating thing. So first thing, I want to just go back to talking about like, for example, Bert and Tom and Joe, we're going to do 500 calories a day on whatever. So those apparatuses don't measure those things effectively either. Just like these watches. But the one thing I will say is, if you are-- like for example, if I do two hours of resistance training, typically, this will say I burned about 1,000 calories. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a lot of resistance training. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My weight workouts are warm up for 10 minutes and then one hour of work done. LAYNE NORTON: I just-- I love to train. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. And you can recover from. My recovery quotient is pretty low. So I've been training for 30 plus years, and I found that if I do more than an hour of hard work in the gym, meaning resistance training, 75 minutes maybe, I'm OK, but past that, I have to take two, maybe even three days off before I can train. My nervous system just doesn't tolerate it well. So I limit it to an hour, you know. LAYNE NORTON: And part of that to remember is like, I've built up to that over a long period of time. So you couldn't just throw somebody in and start having them do two hours a day. It's not going to go well for them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a quick break, and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take athletic Greens, once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important, it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational or nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com.huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3, K2. LAYNE NORTON: But I will say about the calorie trackers, so if I'm used to-- OK, I usually burn about 1,000 calories according to this, it's not accurate. But if I go in tomorrow and I do 1,300, it may not be accurate-- I don't know what the exact number is, but I can be relatively confident that it's more than the previous session. And so in terms of comparison, it might be OK, like within subject. And then the other thing I was kind of circling around on was, if you're worried about NEAT, tracking your steps can be helpful because people step counts can spontaneously decrease when they're on a fat loss diet, they don't even realize it. And that, again, not a complete measure of NEAT, but what we've had some clients do with our team building coaches is, they'll say OK, you're, at 8,000 steps right now. We're not going to add any purposeful cardio. But whatever you need to do to maintain that 8,000 steps, do that. And sometimes, they have to add 15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio, because they're spontaneous activity that they're not even aware of goes down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a really excellent point. I've heard the 10,000 steps per day number was, we all heard that. And then I learned that, 10,000 were just kind of thrown out as an arbitrary number. So we're like get eight-hour intermittent fasting thing, there's a story behind that because actually I spoke to Satchin, and it turns out that the graduate student in his lab did that initial study, which was on mice, by the way, was limited to being in lab for about eight hours by their significant other. So the eight-hour feeding window is actually the consequence of this person's relationship. So-- LAYNE NORTON: That is a really great point that people don't realize when they-- a lot of people will try to copy like scientific studies. And I'll tell people like, listen, scientific studies are so confined. You need to be very careful with how broadly you apply what's in there. Like they're a very big hammer is the way I look at it. They're not a scalpel, they're a big hammer. And I think, a lot of times in terms of coaching, scientific studies will tell you what not to do rather than what to do, right? But getting back to your question about exercise, appetite, so first off, I'm not really aware if there's evidence showing like differential effects of different forms of exercise on appetite, it's possible, but again, it also could be like a placebo effect, right? Because we-- like for example, you and I, grew up in an era where the muscle magazines, it was like, well, as soon as you finish your workout, you have your biggest meal of the day. And when I say placebo effect, I think people have the wrong idea of what the placebo effect is. They think that's just a feeling. Placebo effect can actually change your physiology. People don't realize this. There's research showing that a placebo or the power of suggestion is basically as powerful as some pharmaceuticals. And one of the great examples I like to use is-- actually, there was a study we just covered in our research review on creatine where they did four groups-- not supplemented with creatine, told they weren't supplemented with creatine, not supplemented, told they were supplemented, supplemented, told they weren't, supplemented, until they were. Basically, it just matters what they told them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is incredible. I have to get this study well so we can link to a colleague of mine at Stanford. She's been on the podcast. I'd love to introduce you to because I think you guys really riff. First of all, she was a former D1 athlete and then as runs a lab at Stanford in psychology. This is Alia Crum. And she's-- and grew up in this very athletic, obviously, and very, very smart. And her laboratory focuses on these belief/placebo effects where if you tell people all the horrible things that stress do to you in terms of your memory and cognitive functioning and then you give them a memory test, they perform well below baseline. If you tell them that stress sharpens them in the short term, and that adrenaline is this powerful molecule that can really tune up a number of memory systems, memory improves. And it's remarkable. And it's consistent. And they've done this for any number of different things, including food allergies, for instance. Incredible results. In any case, I'm so glad you're bringing this up. I take creatine monohydrate, and I have for years. 5 grams a day. I don't-- LAYNE NORTON: And it's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's great. And I believe it's great. So is there a compound effect of believing it's great and it actually being great? LAYNE NORTON: Not in this study. So I think the thing to point out, people will misinterpret that as creatine doesn't work. And that's not what that says. What it says is, your beliefs about what it does are probably just as powerful as what it does. So they actually did a study-- and I don't have the citation, but it was-- I think, within the last 10 years where they told people they were putting them on anabolic steroids. And wouldn't you know it, they had better gains-- even though they weren't actually on anabolic steroids, they had better gains than people that they didn't tell were anabolic steroids. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. LAYNE NORTON: And that's like hard outcomes. Strength, lean body mass, those sorts of things. So when people say, well, I wouldn't fall for the placebo effect, it's like, you don't have to fall for it. If you believe it to be true, the power of belief is very, very powerful. And as a scientist, I wish, sometimes, I was ignorant so that I could subject myself to the placebo effect more often. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, absolutely. LAYNE NORTON: So getting back to, that's just a possible explanation of, maybe, why. And I'm the same way, like I get done with a workout, like a resistance training session, I'm like, I'm ready to eat. Now, if you look at the literature overall on exercise and appetite, it's not always what you'd expect. Consistently, it seems to show that exercise actually has an appetite suppressant effect. So people don't tend to compensate at least fully for the amount of movement they do. And there is some evidence that-- you've probably heard people say, well, exercise a really poor weight loss tool. If you figure out how many calories you should be burning from it and you do that, you end up getting less weight loss that you would predict. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a family member who is perfectly happy to eat less, but doesn't loathe exercise, but dislikes exercise. And they're of healthy weight. But I'm always encouraging them to exercise more. And so this is an ongoing battle in our sibling relationship. LAYNE NORTON: Well, one thing I would say is that, exercise independent of anything that happens with your body weight, you will be healthier. So exercise is one of the only things that will actually improve your biomarkers of health without even losing weight. So those-- it will improve your insulin sensitivity, inflammation, all that stuff. So everybody out there looking for a hack to be healthier exercises the hack, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Crucial point. And our mutual friend Dr. Peter Attia, I think, has gone on record several times now saying that of all the things that one could take-- NMN, et cetera, metformin. Regardless of whether or not one takes those or doesn't take those, that the positive effects on longevity by way of biomarkers from regular exercise is-- far outweighs all of those things combined. Not that those things don't necessarily work, we're not going through them in detail now, but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do for our health span and lifespan. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. Absolutely. I 100% agree. And when you're talking about weight loss, people miss the point of exercise, I think. There's some work that came out from Herman Pontzer as well that basically showed like, well, if you do 100 calories from exercise, you have a 28-calorie reduction in your basal metabolic rate in response to that. So it's kind of like this constrained energy expenditure model. But what I would say is, OK, well there's still a net of 72. So it's still OK, and the other thing is, I think the effects of exercise on weight loss are actually more due to what it does to appetite. So if you look at people who lose weight and keep it off for a number of years, kind of outliers because most people don't keep it off for years, over 70% of them engage in regular exercise. Of people who do not keep weight loss, like maintain weight loss, less than 30% exercise regularly. So now that's just a correlation. That doesn't necessarily prove causation. But there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to satiety signals. So basically, you can have the same satiety signals, but you're more sensitive to them when you exercise. And there's actually a really classic study from the 1950s in Bengali workers where they looked at, basically, four different quadrants of activity. So you had sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, heavily active. Basically, based on their job choice. And they didn't have an intervention. They just wanted to track them and see how many calories did they actually eat. So it was like a J-shaped curve. So the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active or moderately active. But from lightly active to heavily active, they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating. So to me, that suggests, when you become active, you can actually regulate your appetite appropriately or much more appropriately than if you're sedentary. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do you think this has to do with changes in the brain-- brain centers that respond to satiety signals from the periphery, and/or do you think it has to do with changes in blood sugar regulation? What I was taught, and I don't know if this is still considered true, is that spikes in blood sugar will trigger a desire to eat more even though it's kind of exactly the opposite of what you need when you have a spike in blood sugar. And there's this kind of-- and we'll get into this when we talk about artificial sweeteners. This is the idea in mind. I think I adopted, perhaps, falsely that you eat something that's sweeter, that tastes really good, and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more. And I could imagine how exercise, if it is increasing the satiety signals, could be working a number of different ways. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. I think it's-- I think the effect is probably mostly at the brain level. The effects on blood sugar-- the research out there is not very compelling for blood sugar driving appetite. Now, if you become hypoglycemic, yes, you'll get hungry, but it's a different kind of hunger than your normal like, I feel kind of empty and my stomach's growling. Like those are-- they can go together, but usually like the hypoglycemia is like, I am hot, I feel like I'm going to pass out. You want to eat something not because your stomach's growling but because that you just need some fuel. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like you're getting pulled under. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've been there when I've done the longer fasts, something I don't do anymore and drink a lot of black coffee. There was probably an electrolyte effect there because coffee as you excrete sodium and other electrolytes. And then just feeling like, I needed something. This whole thing like I need something that's kind of desperation. I never want to be back here again. Hypoglycemia is very uncomfortable. LAYNE NORTON: It's not fun. So again, then when they look at actual randomized controlled trials of implementing some exercise where they're pretty controlled environment, they typically see people-- if anything, they eat less as opposed to eating more. Now, some people, again, studies report averages. And there's individual data points. So there are some people who at least anecdotally report that exercise makes them more hungry. That's completely valid. It could be their beliefs around it, it could be a number of different things, but it's important to understand that there is individual variability. And I think one of the things that I've learned to appreciate more is not trying to separate psychology and physiology. We do this a lot and say, well, I want to know the physiology, I don't care about the psychology of it. And now I'm kind of appreciating more, psychology is physiology. Like with most things now, we have kind of the biopsychosocial model. And I'll give you an example of this. A lot of people get really caught up with appetite. And if we could just suppress people's appetite, that's part of it. But people don't just eat because they're hungry, they eat for a lot of different reasons, social reasons, especially. So can you remember the last social event you ever went to that didn't have food? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. LAYNE NORTON: Right. If you look at dinner plates from the 1800s, they're about this big. Now how big are dinner plates? ANDREW HUBERMAN: The whole buffet. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: There's situational cues. You're sitting down to watch TV. Oh, grab some popcorn, grab some snack, whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I even see this with-- you know, how one person will pick up the phone and then everyone picks up their phone. I think there's a similar effect with food. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. And same thing, right? Like how many times have we either done it ourselves or have been experienced people saying, oh, you should have something-- you should have alcohol, especially, right? People-- I was hanging out with somebody last night and I had a beer and they just had a water. And I'm like, I feel no need to try and convince them to do that with me. You know what I mean? But as humans, we're hurt animals. We don't want to be doing something out in isolation on our own. Now, this is a very tenuous, I guess, belief of mine. But doing things alone in isolation during ancestral times, that's going to set off your alarm system. Because if you don't have other people, you can't protect yourself. So typically, things were done together in groups. And I think that's a lot of the reason why we tend to be just tribal in nature about a lot of things. So the whole point to that is, on the list of reasons why people eat, I mean, I've gotten to the point where I think that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat. Stress, lack of sleep-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Boredom. LAYNE NORTON: --boredom. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely. So unless we can do something that addresses all those things, there's a line from a review paper-- this review paper came out in 2011 is by a researcher named MacLean. And it's the best review paper I've ever read. It was called, biology's response to dieting-- the impetus for weight regain. And basically went through all the mechanisms of these adaptations that happen during fat loss diets and how biology's response is to try to drive you back to your previous. And I'm going to butcher the quote, but at the end of the study he said, basically, the body's systems are comprehensive, redundant, and well-focused on restoring depleted energy reserves. And any attempt or any strategy for weight loss that doesn't attempt to address a broad spectrum of these things is going to fail. And so that's why when people say, well, just do low carb, you won't be hungry. Look, people don't just eat because they're hungry. So I think really like trying to get outside the box and think about these things. And especially, when you read some of the literature, I recently read a systematic review of successful weight loss maintainers, which I thought was really interesting. So they took people who had lost a significant amount of body weight and kept it off for, I think, it was three years. And it basically asked them questions and tried to identify commonalities. And there were some things that I expected like cognitive restraint, self monitoring, exercise. And then one of the things they said that I found really fascinating was pretty ubiquitous between people. They said, I had to develop a new identity. So are you familiar with Ethan Suplee? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. LAYNE NORTON: So Ethan is an actor. He's been in like remember the Titans and American History X. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I certainly saw American History X. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So he was very large. He was like 550 pounds. And now he's like 230 and jacked. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, 5-- he was how many-- LAYNE NORTON: 550 pounds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. LAYNE NORTON: And he has-- whenever he puts up post on his Instagram of him training, it'll say, I killed my clone today. And I asked him, is this what you're talking about? Creating a new identity. And he said, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Because I had to kill who I was. Because there was no way I was going to be able to make long term changes if I just didn't become a new person. Because I mean, and addicts talk about this. Like people who are alcoholics. They had to get new friends. They had to hang out at different places, because their entire life had been set up around this lifestyle for alcohol. And I would actually argue that eating disorders or disordered eating patterns is much harder to break than other forms of addiction. And you think about food addiction. Well, in some ways, bulimia and anorexia are still addictions. You can't stop eating. Like if you're alcoholic, you can abstain from alcohol. If you become addicted to say, cocaine, you can abstain from that. You can never abstain from food. And so now imagine telling a gambling addict, well, you've got to play this slot a couple of times a day but no more. Like that's really challenging. So yeah. I just-- like all this stuff, it's so important to be comprehensive with how we treat these things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. These are incredibly important points. And to my knowledge, I don't think anyone has really described it in a cohesive way the way that you're doing here. So important for people to understand this because obviously, as a neuroscientist, I think the nervous system is creating our thoughts, our thoughts and feelings are related to psychology, and therefore, of course, our physiology and our psychology are one and the same. It's bidirectional. Now, nowadays, there's a lot of interest in brain, body, and particular gut-- brain axis and we can talk about that. But I really appreciate that you're spelling out how there are these different variables. Each one can account for a number of different things. Exercise clearly has a remarkably potent effect-- both during the exercise in terms of caloric burn and overall health and biomarkers. And then this is wonderful to learn that it can increase the sensitivity to satiety signals. I think that makes-- at least in my mind, places very high on the list of things that people should absolutely do. But there are other factors too. And the identity piece is fascinating. It reminds me also-- your story reminds me also of David Goggins who is-- he talks about his former very overweight self almost as if it was a different person. And he uses language that I'm not going to use here. But you know what? I've met David, know David a bit, and his every bit is intense and driven as and a remarkable human being as he appears to be online. He is that guy. But it does seem like he had to more or less kill off a former version of himself and continues to do that every day. And I think what your point about this other fellow who does it through a similar process, the word "today" seems to really matter. It's not like you defeat this former version of yourself and then that person is buried and gone, you said, you know, I killed my clone today, and that's the way that David talks about it also. So this is a daily process. And I think this is not just a small detail in time together all these things. I think that what you are describing is fundamental, because we can pull on each one of these variables and talk about each one of them. But at the end of the day, we are a cohesive whole as an individual. Sorry. You were about to say. LAYNE NORTON: That gets actually into one of my favorite topics, which is, why do we have such a hard time with losing weight but more so keeping it off? Because of obese people, six out of every seven obese people will lose a significant amount of body weight in their life. So why do we still have an obesity problem? They don't keep it off. Why don't they keep it off? When you look at the research, basically, what it suggests is because people think about, I am going to do a diet, and I'm going to lose this weight, and they do not give any thought to what happens afterwards. It's like think about if you have some chronic disease or a diabetic. You can't just take insulin once and that's it, right? You've got to take it continuously, otherwise, you're going to have problems. If you do a diet and you lose 30 pounds, fantastic. But if you then just go back to all your old habits, you're going to go back to where you were, if not more. You can't create a new version of yourself while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you. So what I'll tell people is-- because people say, well, I'm doing a carnivore diet or I'm doing this diet or that diet. And I'll say that's fine. Do you see yourself doing that for the rest of your life? And if the answer is yes, if you really believe that that's going to be sustainable for you, and plenty of people, low carb, intermittent fasting, whatever, they say, I felt easy. I could do this forever. Great. If you're going to lose weight, you have to invoke some form of restriction-- whether it is a nutrient restriction like low carb, low fat, a time restriction-- intermittent fasting any form of time restricted eating, or calorie restriction-- tracking macros, whatever. So you get to pick the form of restriction. So pick the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual, and also do not assume that it will feel the same for everybody else because I made this mistake. Whereas it's like, I track things. And so I allow myself to eat a variety of foods, I allow myself to eat some fun foods. But I track everything, and I'm able to modify my body composition and be in good health doing that. Now, doesn't feel hard for me. Part of it, I've just been doing it for so long. But to other people, that's very stressful. They don't want to-- they say, well, I'd rather just not eat for 16 hours. If that feels easy for them, do that because the one thing that-- there was a couple of meta analysis on popular diets. And basically, what they showed was they were all equally terrible for long term weight loss. But when they stratified them by adherence-- and none of them were better for adherence overall. But when they stratified people just according from lowest adherence to best adherence, there it was a linear effect on weight loss. So really what it says is, what is the diet that's going to be easiest for you to adhere to in the long term and you should probably do that? And people-- again, this is where I step back and take the 10,000-foot view. Somebody will say, well, I'm going to do ketogenic because I want to increase my fat oxidation and I want to do this. And they're talking about all these mechanisms and everything. And that's great. Can you do it for the rest of your life? Is this going to be something sustainable for you? And if the answer is, no, you probably need to rethink what your approach is going to be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredibly important message. Basically, that. If I could highlight-- if there was a version of highlight or boldface and underline in the podcast space, I would highlight-- boldface and underline what you just said. And for those of you that heard it, listen to it twice, and then go forward because it's absolutely key. I think it also explains a lot of the so-called controversy that exists out there. I think it also crosses over with the placebo effect. I almost want to say, pick the nutrition plan that you think you can stick to for a long period of time, ideally forever. And pick your placebo too, because there is a lot of placebo woven into each and every one of these things-- intermittent fasting, keto. Probably even vegan versus omnivore versus carnivore. LAYNE NORTON: Well, they even talk about the diet-- honeymoon period where you go into a diet and you're all fired up about it and like you're very adherent, and then what happens, with every single diet without exception in research studies is once you get past few months, adherence just starts waiting and going off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Here we are really talking about a form of relationship. I'm not saying that to be tongue in cheek. Actually, we had a guest early on in the podcast, Dr. Karl Deisseroth, he's a psychiatrist and a bioengineer at Stanford. Tremendously successful. Alaska award winner, et cetera. And he talked about love as a sort of an interesting aspect of our psychology where it's a story that you co-create with somebody but that you live into the future of that story. When you pair up with somebody that was referring to romantic love, that there's this sort of mutual agreement to create this idea that you're going to live into. So it's not just about how you feel in the moment, it's also that you project into the future quite a lot. I'm seeing a lot of parallels with a highly functional and effective diet. And I love it. I'm not setting this parallel up artificially, I'm setting up because I think that ultimately it boils down to what you said earlier, which is that the brain and our decisions about what we are going to stick to are tremendously powerful. LAYNE NORTON: I think one thing I will say is keep in mind, when you look at the research data, the meta analyzes on say, time-restricted eating versus none, when calories are equated, doesn't seem to be a difference in weight loss, fat loss, and most biomarkers of health. Same thing for low carb versus low fat. Fewer quick calories and protein. There was a meta analysis done by Kevin Hall back in 2017 where they looked at the-- and again, actual loss of body fat. And another important point was, I think there was 22 studies in this. But all of them provided food to the participants That's important because that ensures that adherence can be much higher in those studies whereas various free living studies, sometimes, you can see funky results. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People are sneaking food or they're just not really-- LAYNE NORTON: It's very difficult-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --eating the way that the study would ideally have them eat. LAYNE NORTON: Unless the person is getting like continuous support-- like, studies where they have a dietician talk to people like every week tend to actually have pretty good adherence. I mean, that's expensive to have done the study. And again, like what limits studies, money, money, and money. But the low carb versus low fat, protein, and calories are equated, basically, no difference in fat loss. Now, some people get upset about this. But it's like-- what to me, that's like-- this is great because you get to pick the tool you want. The one tool, it doesn't seem to be that much better than another. So pick the one that works for you. Whatever lever you've got a pull, you've got a bunch of different options. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned picking something that you can stick to for a period of time. Is there ever a case for someone saying, look, I like to eat low carb or even keto for six months and then switch to a more standard omnivore caloric maintenance type diet and then switch back? Is there any downside to doing that for sake of health or weight loss over time, or weight maintenance over time? Because I realize not everyone is trying to lose weight. And I definitely want to talk about, at some point, how to eat to maintain weight. Because I think there are a significant fraction of people out there who are trying to do that. Yeah. Is there any downside to being a dabbler? Keto for a few months and then omnivore for a few months, et cetera? LAYNE NORTON: I think that's actually a great thing, especially to like, maybe, find what you feel is easiest for you. But in terms of as a strategy, I mean, I guess, some people just might get into dopamine but like, oh, change and get something new. And you feel a little bit more positive about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do partner model. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So I don't think it's how I would usually set things up initially for somebody, but if somebody said, hey, I just like to have some variety and change it up, as long as they're still like-- their behaviors and they're doing portion control or whatever it is, and they're able to sustain a calorie deficit or depending on whatever their goal is, I don't think there's really any downside to it. I do think the one thing to keep in mind is, when you look at like going between extremes, so like low fat to low carb or vise versa, there can be, in that transition, period a little bit of weirdness for lack of a better term. Like for example, if you've been on a ketogenic diet and all of a sudden, you move to a higher carb diet, you'll be basically insulin resistant for just a short period of time. Now, is that going to cause any health problems? Probably not in the long term, especially, if you're still controlling calories. But just because your body has like upregulated these systems, dealing mostly with fat and glucose production rather than glucose metabolism, so now if you start taking glucose or carbohydrate back in, like for example, you get somebody-- or a glucose tolerance test after they've been on keto, they'll do pretty terribly at it. But that doesn't last that long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: About how long? LAYNE NORTON: A few weeks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's important for people to know, because I have a feeling during those first few weeks are the period of time when a lot of people go running back to what they were doing previously. Which is not to say that they shouldn't, but I've certainly done that. I've tried very low carbohydrate diet, and I would have assumed-- and now I know I'm completely wrong, but I assumed that I was so carbohydrate starved for so long that my insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing, by the way folks, would have gone through the roof, and I would be able to just sponge up every bit of glucose that I would have ingested through carbohydrate. So I did indeed switch over. And I felt like I had pretty terrible brain fog. I even got some jitters. And I thought, what is this? My blood sugar was low before, and now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory. But based on what you just said, I'd upregulated the enzymes and systems in the body for fat metabolism on the keto diet and then switching over-- there was basically a ramping up of the molecules involved in-- presumably in glycolysis. LAYNE NORTON: Transition period. I mean, think about if you haven't weight trained before and you start weight training, you're going to feel pretty terrible. Like you're going to be sore and stiff and all that kind of stuff. But I will say, you aren't necessarily wrong in what you said about being more insulin sensitive, because it depends on how you measure insulin sensitivity. So if you measure with something like fasting blood glucose or fasting insulin or even HOMA-IR, those tend to be pretty good on low carb. But then if you do it all glucose tolerance test, it tends to be pretty bad. And so it depends on your specific measure. So I think that the idea that keto makes you glucose intolerant or insulin resistant, I think, again, it's just a transition period. And I'm not too worried about it. But it is something important to keep in mind. And one of the reasons like if somebody was to transition out of keto, typically, if I'm working with them or one of our coaches are working with them, we'll kind of instruct them to do it like slowly and systematically over like a four to eight-week period. That way, hopefully, they're not having that period of two weeks where they're like, oh, man, why do I feel so terrible? ANDREW HUBERMAN: A very important point. I want to go to the other end literally and figuratively and talk about gut health, because up until now, and certainly-- LAYNE NORTON: I see what you did with that pun. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And certainly in the last few minutes, we've been talking a lot about top-down processes. The brain, the psychology, placebo effects, but the very real aspects of those, not that I can imagine 2,000 calories, 1,000 calories and somehow change the law of thermodynamics. Can't do that. But we've been top-down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight loss maintenance and weight gain. But gut health, at least the more popular studies on gut health, have blown a lot of things out of the water. For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice and literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice, and yes, that sounds like what it sounds like. Fecal transplants definitely inserted through the same end in which it comes out. And I point that out because a lot of people have asked me that they-- and it was kind of scary to me, I thought, yes, this is not about ingesting feces, this is-- they literally do a transplant of these from lean mice into obese mice and the obese mice get lean. And yes, this has been done in humans. Limited number of studies and observed some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that I have to assume could be related to placebo effect. They might have told these obese people, hey, look, you're going to get lean through this fecal transplant from lean people. But more likely, it had some effect on their core physiology. I don't know which aspects although, I can speculate which ones. And they became leaner. They lost weight. And that is, in some sense, miraculous, especially given the important role of psychology and exercise and satiety signals, because I'm going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables, although no study is perfect. What are your thoughts about gut health as it relates to metabolism, energy utilization, and balance? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So the first thing I'll say is I'm not a gut health expert, but I will-- I feel relatively comfortable talking about it based on conversations I've had with people who are experts-- one being Suzanne Devkota who's-- you're familiar with her? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, she's sort of a phenom in this area from what I understood. LAYNE NORTON: So she was actually doing her masters when I was doing my PhD in Lehman's lab. So she was one of my lab mates. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. LAYNE NORTON: And the other thing to say is, even gut health experts, and Suzanne will tell you this, they're like, talk to me in 20 years. We just know so little. I think that's an overall thing that people don't understand is the scientific consensus moves very, very slow, probably for good reason. Because if we just flipped our scientific consensus based on one study, I mean, it would be a mess. So it's going to take time before we really understand the implications of the gut and what it means. So when it comes to weight loss, there probably is a role in there. I mean, we've seen that there's something going on. Now, whether that's-- is it something where a gut microbiome make makeup that's more obese resistant, perhaps, it extracts less calories out of the food you eat. Or perhaps, it's elevating BMR. Although, I think that that's probably somewhat unlikely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you think it could impact the way satiety signals are? LAYNE NORTON: So that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, back to the brain again. LAYNE NORTON: --so that's-- we know that there's a link in the gut brain axis. And so my suspicion is that it probably is working via appetite regulation. So I mean, if we look at the most effective obesity treatments out there, which is like semaglutide, I mean, you consistently see a 15% on average loss of body weight, which is massive and people keep it off. That is a GLP-1 mimetic which is a gut hormone. And it, basically, just is a very, very powerful appetite suppressant. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I guess I'm interrupting, but hopefully, with a purpose. There's this really interesting study. And it's in mice, admittedly, but published in a neuroscience journal recently. And basically, the takeaway is that like so many things in neuroscience, the GLP-1 works in two parallel pathways. In the brain, it seems to impact neurons in the hypothalamus that control satiety. So exactly what you're saying. And in the gut, it seems to create an activation of the mechanosensors in the gut. So the perception is that the gut is full even-- or fuller. I should say, not full, because I think people who take semaglutide don't feel bloated. I don't know, they might. But that one feels as if their gut is actually fuller because these mechanical sensors that send-- stretch are sending signals to the brain, oh, I actually have some food. I'm not empty down there. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anyway, I'm tickled by this result mostly because every time I hear about a drug or a molecule having an effect, we think it has an effect at one location. But it's kind of interesting that, especially for something like appetite regulation, that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel. Anyway, forgive me. LAYNE NORTON: That's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can tell I'm really excited about this. And here you are telling a neuroscientist, me, that a lot, perhaps, circles back to these brain mechanisms of satiety. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. I mean, I think that-- and especially looking at the research on leptin, you we used to think, OK, metabolism is mostly like liver-based and then there's metabolism in the adipocyte and skeletal muscle. But none of this stuff exists in isolation. There's so much crosstalk between these pathways. And that's-- when we get into mechanisms-- though one of the things I love mechanisms. But one of the things I tell people is keep in mind that when you're dealing with an outcome, like when I say outcome-based, we're talking about physical outcomes like weight loss, fat loss, changes in blood markers, whatever, though that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms. So sure, sometimes, you can affect a mechanistic pathway, and you get straight down the line outcome, but not always. Whenever you make a treatment or anything into the system, it's like throwing a pebble in a lake. It creates ripples. And we don't always know what those are going to be. And that's why-- I mean, we've seen certain drugs, what works on this pathway. And then they list off all the side effects. And you go, well, how would it create that many side effects? Because nothing-- for the most part, they don't just work in one place. There's multitude of places it works. And to your point about semaglutide and the effects on mechanical sensors, it's probably why a lot of people report actually low grade nausea when they're using semaglutide. Because of that. Because if you're-- that feeling is usually not like a real comfortable feeling, but I mean, it will get you to not eat. So I think there's absolutely likely a connection, but we haven't fully elucidated how that works. And we think about how complicated the gut is. I think I heard something like there's more cells in our microbiome by far than there are in our body. So we're actually more-- in terms of a cell per cell level, we're actually more bacteria than we are eukaryote. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's Justin Sonnenburg who's one of the world experts on microbiome. He's in the lab upstairs from mine at Stanford. And he has this idea-- it's just an idea that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are cells, the question is, who's the host and who's the passenger? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe, we are just-- maybe they're exploiting us to take them around and interact, because they interact and grow on one another. And so this idea that this freaks people out, Lex Fridman will love this. That maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the microbiome and not the other way around. Anyway, kind of a scary thought. Do you do anything specifically to support your gut microbiome? Are you a probiotic guy or a fermented foods guy or a fiber guy? LAYNE NORTON: So-- again, I'm going to kind of go straight down the line from what I've heard from Suzanne and other experts. So if you want to improve gut health, one of the biggest levers-- the three biggest levers you can pull is not eating too many calories, exercising-- there is a connection between exercise and the gut, and fiber. So it is-- of the things we know, dietary fiber seems to positively impact the gut because it is what's called a prebiotic. So your gut microbiota can take, especially, soluble fiber. Although, there's actually some evidence, at least in mice, that they might be able to use some insoluble fiber as well. I think Suzanne was doing a study looking at hemicellulose and actually seeing that some, like specific forms of microbiota, flourish with hemicellulose suggesting that they may actually be getting some kind of fuel out of it, which is really interesting. But again, in mice-- so just a huge caveat. So your gut microbiome can produce these short chain fatty acids by fermenting the soluble fiber. And there's quite a bit of evidence that these volatile fatty acids, which can be then actually reabsorbed into the liver, that they have some positive effects. Like for example, butyrate. When they've done butyrate supplementation, they've actually seen positive effects on insulin sensitivity. So what we seem to understand is that more diversity seems to be better, fiber seems to be positive, prebiotics seem to work much better than probiotics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Supplemented prebiotics. LAYNE NORTON: Yes. So the problem with most of the probiotics is they're typically not concentrated enough to actually colonize. And even if you do colonize, what happens is like, let's say you colonize some microbiota that you didn't really have much of. If you're not fueling it with the appropriate fiber, it's not going to stay anyway, because it's essentially going to starve. So the research seems to really clearly suggest that eating enough fiber, which is, again, a prebiotic, that that is a better way to get a healthier gut per se than probiotic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What fiber sources do you use? And I think-- I mean, I realize there's a huge array of choices out there, but people will want to have some ideas as to how they could, perhaps, mimic what you're doing. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. And I would just say diversity. So there's various evidence from various different fiber sources-- fruits and vegetables, obviously, grains, some whole grains, some cereals, and then various other sources. So this is one of the things where we don't really have a good idea. If you know this one source of fiber is better than another source of fiber, we just know that fiber overall is pretty good. And one thing I'll tell people is like if you want a longevity hack, I mean, fiber is kind of the longevity hack. If you look at some of these cohort studies, there was actually a recent really large meta analysis of over a million subjects. And basically, what it showed was that for every 10 gram increase in fiber, there was a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality. And that extended, specifically, also to cardiovascular disease and cancer. So one of the things I'll tell people when they get like really into whether it's intermittent fasting or all these other things, say, that's great, that's great. Are you eating like over 50, 60 grams of fiber a day? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Conceptualize 50 or 60 grams. So if I were to eat like a-- let's just say, a quarter plate of broccoli and the broccoli isn't stacked to the ceiling. The broccoli is just reasonably stacked on there. Approximately, how many grams of fiber is that? If it's like two cups of broccoli. There's a lot. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So like 200 grams of broccoli, per se, would probably be like 5, 6 grams of fiber. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I need to get how much per day? LAYNE NORTON: Well, I would say-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ideally. LAYNE NORTON: --typically, what the recommended dose is is 15 grams per 1,000 calories intake because if you're eating low calories, it's difficult to get enough fiber in. But based on-- and again, these are cohort studies. But you can't do 20-year long randomized human control trials, unfortunately. That doesn't really appear to be a top end, at least for the benefits of fiber. It probably boils down to how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable. Because if you're eating like a ton of fiber, I mean, at some point, it's not going to be very comfortable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Exercise becomes uncomfortable or hazardous. Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: And I actually a-- kind of touching on that because I think it is important. A lot of people have kind of-- in the carnivore community said, well, you don't need fiber, you poop just fine without it. And I'll always say, well, pooping is the last reason to have fiber. Like yes, it does help. It does seem to make elimination easier, you can do it more frequently, adds bulk to stool. But that's not why you should eat fiber. Why should eat fiber is because of the effects of mortality. And some of the pushback will be, well, this is healthy user bias. And what I'll say is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, healthy people do this and therefore it's working. LAYNE NORTON: Healthy people eat more fiber and therefore-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: And I mean, yeah. There's something to that. But if it was just healthy user bias, typically, you would see some disagreement between the studies. And a great example of that is like red meat. So not every study shows red meat has an association with cancer and mortality. There's differences depending on the population use, depending on what they define as high red meat, low red meat, whether it's processed, unprocessed. But I have not found a study on fiber and cardiovascular disease and cancer and mortality where it did not show improvements from higher fiber. So to me, that suggests that that effect is real. And so again, as much fiber as you can get in comfortably, I would try to do it because it seems to have some really powerful effects and is good for the gut microbiome. The other thing that may be a consideration for the microbiome is there's some evidence that saturated fat may not be great for the microbiome. That it reduces the prevalence of some of the more positive strains of bacteria. And that appears to be not so much from the saturated fat itself but from the bile end products that combine with saturated fat seems to have a negative effect on some of these more healthier forms of gut microbiota. But again, this is really difficult because we don't even know necessarily yet which species of gut microbiota are positive or negative. And that's-- I mean, this gets into some of these studies where they may call it dysbiosis. Sounds scary, but dysbiosis just means that the gut changed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LAYNE NORTON: It doesn't necessarily-- it doesn't tell you anything qualitative about whether the change was bad or good. And so these are just things, I think, we need to keep in mind when we talk about this stuff. That this stuff is still very much in its infancy. But in terms of the big levers, I mean, it's pretty much fits with what we know about a healthy lifestyle. Exercise, don't eat too much, consume a good amount of fiber from diverse sources. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. Fantastic because it fits with what I like to think of as the center of mass of evidence. And I'm starting to get some window into what your process is around selection of studies and no one study being wholly, but when you look at, as you mentioned, all the studies on fiber having a positive effect to some degree or another, it's pretty hard to refute that there isn't something really interesting there. LAYNE NORTON: And one thing I'll tell people is like, one study-- I mean, sometimes I'll change my opinion based on a single study when it's really well done and very powerful. But usually, one study is just going to move me just a little bit. And then maybe, if another one comes out, maybe a little bit more. And then like very slowly, I'm going to get some-- I mean, my experience with LDL cholesterol, that's something I changed my mind on a while back. When I was younger, like circa 2005 getting into grad school, the prevailing thought was, well, it's not so much the LDL, it's the ratio of LDL to HDL, that's what matters. And probably about five years ago-- and I was pretty strong about that opinion, and then five years ago looking at these Mendelian randomization studies, I went, I can't hold this position anymore. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What is your revised position on LDL? LAYNE NORTON: So if you look at the research, HDL is important because it's a marker of metabolic health. If you have high HDL, it suggests that you are metabolically quite healthy. You very rarely will you have high HDL and high CRP, which is inflammatory marker or dysregulated blood glucose. Almost exclusively, people who have high HDL will have good biomarkers of metabolic health. But if you take drugs that raise HDL, it doesn't reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. In Mendelian randomization studies, which Mendelian randomization basically uses natural randomization. So some people are, in the case of HDL, naturally higher secreted or naturally lower secretions of HDL. And we talked about how-- you can't really do a 20-year human randomized controlled trial. And when you're trying to examine something like heart disease, I mean, that is a lifetime exposure issue. It's very unlikely that you're going to pick out differences between treatments in two years or even five years. I mean, people don't develop-- typically, don't develop heart disease until they're in their 50s, 60s, and 70s. What Mendelian randomization allows is to say, OK, we have these people who naturally secrete more or less. So we can stratify those and look at what is their risk. So if you look at people who are low series of HDL versus high secrete of HDL withholding some of the other key variables consistent like LDL, you don't see an effect on heart disease, really. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of LDL. LAYNE NORTON: Of HDL. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it, OK. LAYNE NORTON: But when you look at LDL and you look at the lifetime exposure to LDL, it is like a linear effect on heart disease. And we know that it's actually not so much LDL, but it's more apolipoprotein B. But that tends to track with LDL just in general. And if you look at the mechanism-- I mean, we know that LDL can penetrate the endothelium, so there's the mechanism is present. If we look at the epidemiology, it supports that it's an independent risk factor, and then, again, these Mendelian randomization studies where we can look at people's exposure over a lifetime, and then we see that linear dose-dependent effect. To me, that was convincing enough to change my mind on that particular topic. And then if you look at some of the Framingham data, look at high-- if you like stratify, like high HDL versus low HDL, both groups looking at high LDL and low LDL. So if you have high HDL, low LDL, you will still be lower risk factor than somebody who is high HDL and high LDL. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the ratio does matter. LAYNE NORTON: The ratio does better. Same thing with inflammation. If you look at people who are low inflammation, low LDL, they'll have a lower risk than people who are low inflammation, high LDL. So again, that was sufficient for me to change my mind. But it took-- it was like not just one study came out. It was, OK, then there was another study, and then another study, ans then another study, and at a certain point I go, OK, well, now, I either have to change my mind or I'm, basically, just going to be cognitively dissonant and say, nope, I don't believe all that. And so I think that's one of the things to keep in mind. People will say, oh, are you saying this is a bad study? Very rarely will I call something, a bad study, because data is just data. But the issue becomes how it is presented and how broadly it's applied in the mainstream media or by people on-- fitness influencers. And what I'll do is try to step in and say, OK, let's consider x, y and z as well. And then it's not a bad study, but let's just be careful about how broadly we apply the interpretation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, and I think you are in a very unique and important position to be able to place things into their proper context because of this, for lack of a better word, holistic view of how the psychology placebo effects also core physiology relate to one another. And so on. In fact, I think that your training as a biochemist and then training as in nutrition with somebody who-- Don Lemon, who was pushing you to focus on outcomes, I think that's a beautiful capture of the continuum at which one can look at something. Because for those of you who don't out there, you know a lot of laboratory studies on mice and humans, for instance, in the realm of biochemistry or in vitro studies, you'll see a change in some molecule can be quite dramatic. And then the assumption is, oh, you just take-- you take the drugs that will change that molecule in a particular direction, and then you'll get the effect you want at the whole organism level. The person will lose weight, the person will gain muscle, the animal will not have Alzheimer's, et cetera. But it just doesn't work that way because of the redundancy, and this interplay. LAYNE NORTON: Well, a great example of that is, so my research was actually in rodents. All my studies on protein metabolism, and leucine, in particular, is what we were studying. Well, we know if you give leucine, it increases muscle protein synthesis. But we also know if you supplement with leucine, people don't get more muscular. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was about to say-- LAYNE NORTON: So as always-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --all you have to do is supplement with leucine? LAYNE NORTON: Right. Right, right. And so how is that possible? Muscle building is not just protein synthesis. It's also the balance between synthesis and degradation. And degradation just happens to be very, very difficult to measure. But a great example-- and again, one of the cool things about my PhD was actually changed the way I ate, which I think is interesting. So before, I had been like, I eat eight meals a day, eat every two hours, try to keep-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Eight meals a day? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah when I got to grad school. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In order to get that 30 grams of protein per meal? LAYNE NORTON: Get that amino drip going in was the idea, right? Like just have an IV hooked up of amino acids. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not really, folks. LAYNE NORTON: Not really, yeah. But that was the concept. But the first study that I did, we, basically, looked at OK, a lot of people had measured the amplitude of protein synthesis in response to a meal. We wanted to see, how long does this last and where does it peak, right? And so my thought was, OK. Well, it'll probably track with plasma leucine. For those that are not familiar, leucine is the amino acid that is almost exclusively responsible for increasing muscle protein synthesis when you eat protein. So it's one of the branched chain amino acids. So we wanted to see, OK, how long does this effect last? So we fed these animals whey protein, and again, I thought, OK, well, however long plasma leucine, stay up that, will be how long protein synthesis stays up. And so we got the protein synthesis data back, and it was peaked at 90 minutes-- or sorry. Peaked from 45 to 90 minutes and, then was back down to baseline by 180 minutes. And so when I went to do the plasma leucine analysis, my shock was, at three hours, plasma leucine was still plateaued out. And then I said, OK, well, when I look at the initiation factors, that will show me something. So for those not familiar, this is part of the mTOR signaling pathway. So one of the-- two of the targets of mTOR, when it's stimulated-- and leucine stimulates mTOR. Two of the targets of mTOR are a protein compound called 4E-BP1. And then another one is called a ribosomal protein S6K. So I don't want to get into the specifics about it because it's going to be on the scope. But basically, when these things are phosphorylated by mTOR, it increases the rate of translation initiation, which translation initiation is, basically, the process of the ribosome hooking on to the mRNA and then starting protein synthesis. So I was looking at the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and RPS6. I was like, OK, well, I'll probably see these things come down in three hours. Still plateaued. And so then it was like, what's going on here? So I actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning the data and rerunning the data. And I'll never forget, I went into Lehman's office. And this is like six months after we've done this study, because this analysis takes time. I was like, so where are we with this duration study? I said, well, I just got to run the plasma data again because it's not right. And he's like, well, why is it not right? And I said, well, it just doesn't make any sense you know. And I kind of went through, he's like well, describe to me your technique. How are you doing this? And I described it, and he said, well, how is your standard error? And I told him what the numbers were, he said, it sounds like it's good data. He said, it sounds like you are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion and you need to change your conclusion to fit the data. And that statement-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is why we do PhDs. LAYNE NORTON: This is why, yeah-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You need an advisor-- LAYNE NORTON: This is why I am so skeptical of everything, because I have had so many of my ideas crushed by my own data, right? So we actually ended up-- this kind of effect, this phenomenon is called muscle protein synthetic refractory period. So basically, like once you trigger the system, runs for a defined period of time and then it takes time to, essentially, reset for lack of a better term. It's also been referred to as the muscle full effect. So I looked at that and said, why am I eating every two hours then? And there was even a study out of Wolf's Lab back in '99, I think, where they infused essential amino acids for six hours. Protein synthesis went up, peaked at 60 minutes, came back down 120, and never went back up again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe I'm being naive. But I would have thought that if protein synthesis goes up and then comes back down, that eating more often would be exactly the thing you would want to do if your goal was to get increased protein synthesis because you'd be pinging the system periodically. LAYNE NORTON: But the problem is, the plasma amino acids are still elevated. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it's, essentially, like eating the whole way through from the perspective of leucine. LAYNE NORTON: From the cells, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. LAYNE NORTON: So that was one of those things where I said, you know what? I'm actually going to eat less often, because if I'm eating in three hours later, I've still got capped out plasma amino acids. And we looked at all kinds of stuff. We looked at intracellular leucine just to make sure that wasn't falling off, it wasn't. We looked at all the plasma, essential amino acids because we were thinking, well, maybe protein synthesis is sucking some of these amino acids out of the plasma and they're dropping and that's causing it to short circuit the system. That wasn't the case. It just-- essentially, what the evidence suggests, I think we're the only ones to show this so far. So I'm not ready to say that this is a real effect, because I hold out the idea that data artifacts do exist and you can't be totally sure. But we saw an increase in AMP kinase around this mark where protein synthesis started falling off. And we also saw a decrease in intracellular ATP. And protein synthesis is an ATP-dependent process. And so what we think might be happening is, you're consuming protein and you're-- you're increasing muscle protein synthesis, and then at a certain point, it has enough effect on your energy metabolism in your cells that it short-- not short circuits it, but it cuts it off, right? So again, we're the only ones to show that. That I'm aware of. And that was again, in rats. So I always talk about data. Like, there's data I'm willing to bet my toe on, my foot on, my leg on, and my life on. I'd probably barely bet the end of my little toe on that one. I'm not quite sure. But it's interesting nonetheless. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: A proportional wait here. LAYNE NORTON: --that's a great example of, OK, we're looking at this mechanism of mTOR signaling, and if we just looked at that, we'd say, oh, well, protein synthesis is going to stay elevated for past three hours. But that's not what we saw. So yeah. I think, it's, again, that's why I really try to get people to say, well, let's-- mechanisms are important. And especially, if you're seeing an outcome, it's important to identify mechanisms that may explain that. But let's step back from the mechanisms from trying to chase mechanisms. And let's look at chasing outcomes in terms of what we recommend to people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Excellent point. In terms of chasing outcomes, a number of people I know are interested in weight loss or weight maintenance. And several times throughout today's conversation, we've come back to this issue of satiety signals. Whether or not there are brain-based, body-based, or both. Not wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain or lose weight because you simply don't want to. I heard you mention earlier that protein and maybe specific types of protein or sources of protein may provide better satiety signals than other macronutrients. Could you briefly talk about how macronutrients, including protein, but also carbohydrates and fats, impact satiety. And from the standpoint of somebody who, for instance, would like to quote unquote, "lose a few pounds," right? Probably would be happy to gain a little bit of lean body mass provided it was in a particular location on their body, that seems to be a thing now. Directed hypertrophy, if you will. And how much they should focus on protein as a core component of creating this diet. Assuming everything else is being done correctly. They're going to hit the right number of calories relative to their output NEAT, et cetera. How should we think about protein and satiety signals? And are animal sources of protein, indeed, more bioavailable? That's a tricky word. For sake of muscle building, but also for sake of somebody who just would like to lose body fat. They don't want to lose muscle and they'd like to bring their weight down a few pounds. LAYNE NORTON: So a lot of things-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or more. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. A lot of things to unpack there. Of the macronutrients, protein is definitely the biggest lever that you can pull, because even if-- it doesn't take a ton of protein to get a lot of the muscle building benefits. I mean, I think the benefits really start to plateau out around 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight. There's some evidence that maybe even up to like 2.4 or 2.8 grams per kilo may give a little bit more benefit. I think it probably looks something like an asymptote in terms of a curve where as you put more into the system, you always get a little bit more, but it just gets to the point where it's so infinitesimally small benefit that it's for all intensive purposes, no benefit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But you mentioned 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, would you consider that a threshold that most people should try and achieve daily? LAYNE NORTON: I see very few downsides to hitting that. I mean, I know some people-- and this is going to get into a separate conversation. But I know some people will say, well, I don't want to stimulate mTOR because that's going to make me die early. And I think, one of the things to keep in mind is if you look at-- there's kind of this thought process out there that if you're stimulating mTOR, that protein is going to make you die early. And first off, we have very little human outcome data to support that claim. And the second thing is, if you look at any macronutrient isolation, I can make a mechanistic argument that it's going to kill you. So fat-- if you take in fat and it decreases flow-mediated dilation. Flow-mediated dilation is important for heart health in the short term. Carbohydrates stimulate insulin. Insulin, you know, pro-inflammatory and all these other things. And so I can make an argument for any single macronutrient to be negative for longevity. I really want people-- this is something that even scientists get wrong. They look at an acute response of something and assume that is going to relate to long term outcomes and signaling. So let's just take exercise, for example. If you didn't know anything about exercise, and I said to you, Andrew, I'm going to do something that's going to make you-- your heart rate go up, your blood pressure go up, your inflammatory markers go up, your reactive oxygen species increase, you're going to say-- and it's going to damage your muscles, you're going to say, I'm not doing that. That sounds horrible. But it does all those things in the short term. But what is the long term effect of exercise? You actually get healthier. All those things improve. Now, I'm not saying that protein is a longevity hack or anything like that, but what I'm saying is, I think some of the arguments out there are based on mechanistic-- this increases mTOR, therefore we don't want to do it. I think it is a much more complicated argument than just that. So there's that. So protein is the biggest lever. I would shoot for 1.6 grams per kilogram. If you can do more, great. There doesn't seem to be really downsides to it. Even up to very high levels of protein. Jose Antonio did a study, that was a year-long randomized control trial. And again, it's just one year. But they were looking at all sorts of different biomarkers. And basically, even up to like 4 grams per kilogram of protein, they couldn't really find any negative health outcomes from it other than people were just so satiated, they ended up eating less calories. So protein is a big lever, because one, it has a higher thermic effect of food, so you're getting a little bit more calorie burn per day even though it's not a ton because TEF is a pretty small percentage of your overall energy expenditure. But still a benefit. You're getting the effects on lean body mass. If you're in a diet, it's going to help preserve lean body mass, if you're at maintenance, it's going to help build a preserved lean body mass, and if you're in a surplus, it's going to help build a preserved lean body mass. Then you get the effects on appetite. So now, I want to be careful because appetite effects tend to be very specific to individual foods. So you can take a high protein food and make it not very satiating. So take, for example, like a really tasty protein bar, which back when we were getting into this, no such thing existed. Now, you have protein bars that actually take pretty darn good. But if you eat one of them, I mean, are you really satiated? I don't really feel satiated, that's my protein bar. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's my premeal snack. LAYNE NORTON: Right. Right. So why? Because, I mean, it's processed, refined, and made to be very palatable. But take something like a 200-gram chicken breast. Very satiating, right? And that's why when people say, well, carbohydrates aren't very satiating, it depends on the carbohydrate. I mean, when you look at the satiety index, a plain baked potato is about as satiating as it gets. ANDREW HUBERMAN: If I eat a bowl of oatmeal, I feel pretty good afterward. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For a while, right? I mean, I usually-- I'll eat that along with some other things, but I completely agree. So you're saying that the form that it comes in, maybe, even how much chewing is required, how good. It smells that your psychological associations-- because to me, a steak is an incredible meal. I mean, if I had to pick one food that I could eat, even though I'm not pure carnivore, for the rest of my life, it would be that because, I think, it would get me where I need to go and then I'd probably have to sneak some fiber. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it's an excellent point. I have a question that I don't want to take us off track, but I'm hoping it relates enough that you could answer it now. In the context of this, if I'm going to eat let's say, 2 grams per kilogram of body weight protein and I'm not eating multiple meals, maybe I'm eating two or three meals per day, I'm certainly going to be eating more than the 30-gram threshold that was thrown around for a long time that we can only assimilate 30 grams of protein per meal. Should I just not worry about that? Some of it is going to go towards the thermic effect of food, some of that might be converted into glucose of all things through gluconeogenesis. So should I worry about this 30-gram cut off? Because I think balancing the 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight threshold with number of meals, with the need to exercise and work and live my life and sleep, et cetera, pretty soon, you run into bottlenecks where you just can't do it or you're spending so much time trying to focus on it. LAYNE NORTON: You can't optimize all the things at the same time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You'd lose your mind and your body. So what is necessary in terms of frequency if one is getting enough protein? And then tied into that question, is there any reality to this idea that if you eat one meal per day or you're fasting and then you eat, let's say, 200 grams of protein in a single feeding, that you can assimilate more because you were protein starved. Is that a real thing? LAYNE NORTON: So most of the studies with protein are after a fast because to assess it with stable isotope, you have to be in a steady state. So we haven't observed that. It doesn't appear that fasting really allows you to assimilate more protein after a fast. So this gets into a core of one of the things I looked at in my PhD, which is, does protein distribution matter? Because most Americans get about 65% to 70% of their protein at dinner. Breakfast tends to be pretty minimal protein foods. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do any cultures, actually, eat big breakfast and not a big lunch and dinner? We all heard that was ideal. We'll get into circadian timing in a little bit, but does anyone actually do that? Steak and eggs for breakfast and then taper off the rest of the day? LAYNE NORTON: I know German culture tends to have a big breakfast, but also tends to be like sugary foods and whatnot. As far as like teleological, I'm actually not sure about that. So if you look at that, and then you consider that protein doesn't really have a storage mechanism. People will say, well, lean tissue is a storage mechanism. That's like saying a house is a storage facility for wood. Yeah, if the house is made out of wood you could get wood out of it, but that's not why you build. You're building the house out of a demand. Same thing for muscle tissue. There is a free pool of amino acids, but it's very, very small. So when you consider things like fat, which, basically, has unlimited storage capacity, carbohydrate, at relatively large storage capacity, you can store 400 or 500 grams of carbohydrate between your liver and muscles. And then protein, which almost has no storage capacity, the idea that, OK, you could make up for a low protein at one meal by over consuming another meal didn't make sense to me. So one of the studies we did-- and again, in rats, we took-- both groups were getting whey protein, so a high quality protein, they were getting the exact same amount of calories, exact same amount of nitrogen, exact same macros. Everything was the same. The only difference was, one group, basically, got three meals of similar amounts of protein. Dinner was a little bit bigger, because we wanted to keep it somewhat similar to how people eat. But each meal was going to be over the threshold to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Whereas the other group, I constructed it so the first two meals of the day should not stimulate muscle protein synthesis. It should be under that threshold. And then the last meal was about 70% of their total daily protein. And so we had them eat those for 11 weeks. And I'll never forget this. This is how obsessive I became about it is, there were 110 animals in the study, and I made all the diets and I weighed out exactly every single meal for every single animal for 11 weeks. So I was in there at 6:00 AM, I was in there at noon, and I was in there at 6:00 PM. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. That's kind of PhD student that professors dream of. You're sounding a dream student. LAYNE NORTON: So at the end of 11 weeks, we looked at like lean body mass, we looked at body fat, we looked at hind limb weights. We didn't really see differences in lean body mass, but what we did see was a difference in hind limb weights. It wasn't massive, but there was a significant difference in the size of the muscles of the hind limbs of these animals. And so it's interesting that there wasn't a difference in lean body mass. And what we found, at least with the liver, the animals that we're eating one meal with really high protein, actually had bigger livers, not like a huge amount and not something that I would consider unsafe, but it was a statistically significant difference. And so to me, at least, like I'm trying to explain like no difference in lean body mass, but a difference in these hind limb weights, maybe there's some sequestering of-- that's fueling a little bit more protein synthesis of the splenic tissues rather than-- because you're capping out skeletal muscle protein synthesis. And we do know that the splanchnic tissues are more sensitive or have a greater rate of protein synthesis per day. Like, the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in humans is about like 1% per day. So it takes like 100 days to turn over skeletal muscle. Whereas like your entire gut, your entire GI will turn itself over in like two to three days. So really-- and the liver also has a very high amount of protein synthesis, which is one of the reasons. It's actually one of the most metabolically active organs. So all that to say, it has not-- there's been one human study that showed something similar. And then there's been a couple of others that didn't. And then in the intermittent fasting studies, which is maybe a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding, one thing I will say is it looks like the 16/8 intermittent fasting style. There's been a couple of studies with Grant Tinsley. And this is something I've changed my mind on as well. Grant Tinsley has done a couple of studies where they did use the 16/8 protocol. They had them train during their feeding window, and they had them eat-- I think it was at least three protein-containing meals during those eight hours. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are humans? LAYNE NORTON: These are humans. And they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study compared to people who were eating as many times as they wanted throughout the day. Now, if you look at some of the more extreme forms of fasting, like alternate day fasting or like 20/2 or 20/4, there are some studies where you do start to see differences in lean body mass. So my suspicion is, and I'm just guessing. So this is tenuous. My suspicion is, probably if you're getting like two to three high quality protein meals in a day, you're getting the vast majority of the benefits of protein. The most important thing is getting enough total. And then secondarily, trying to get at least two or three meals with high quality protein in. But if you're going pretty extreme with like alternate day fasting or maybe only one meal a day, then I think there may be some effects on lean body mass. But again, these can be mitigated as well if you're doing hard resistance training. Typically, that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass. Yes, protein distribution may make a difference, but I'm trying to put it in context so people don't feel like they need to go out and eat four meals a day. But again, so what I would say is like some of the more milder forms of time-restricted eating appear to be fine for lean body mass, now, the caveat is the following. One of the nice things about animal studies is when you consider-- if you want to have a high subject number, high level of control in a long duration, it's pretty much your only option. So in our research review reps, I created a Venn diagram, which basically is like three circles crossing over. One is study duration, one is level of control, and the other one is subject number. And to get all three of those circles to cross over, it almost has to be an animal's. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. And REPS, it's a newsletter or a book? LAYNE NORTON: So it's our monthly research review. So every month we review like five studies that come out in fitness and nutrition. We'll usually do at least one nutrition, one training, and one supplement per month. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We will put a link to where people can sign up. This is a sign up format? Great. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So it's a subscription-based service. So basically, when-- people might look at my study, well, why did you see difference in muscle weights whereas some of these other studies don't see a difference? I weighed out every single meal for 11 weeks, and keep in mind that 11 weeks in a rodent's lifespan is a really long time. That's about an 1/8 of their total lifespan. So is it that there's no effect or is it that the effect is relatively small and would take a really long time and very high level of control to see in humans? I don't know. But I think what I would say relatively confidently is if you're going to do like a 16/8 intermittent fasting, you're probably fine. Especially-- and again, what is the goal? Like if you're a bodybuilder looking to be the most massive person you possibly can or you're a football player or you're in some field that having as much lean body mass as possible is really important for you, then I would say, well, you're not really gaining a whole lot by doing some form of time-restricted eating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most of the people listening to this do not fall into that category. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most people want to maintain or lose weight. They'd like to, perhaps, add a bit of, quote unquote, shape or muscle to specific areas of their body and lose body fat. LAYNE NORTON: Right. And I think your normal forms of time-restricted, and you're probably perfectly fine for that. And again, I don't want somebody to think, well, I do alternate day fasting, there's no point to me resisting training because I'm going to lose muscle mass. No. No, no, no, no. You can still build muscle doing that. You just might not build as much muscle as you would if you were eating in a more traditional format. But if that's something that works for you and your goals, and especially, if it's fat loss or controlling your calories, then again, it's about the hierarchy of what's important. So to answer your question, I do think that timing and frequency matters a little-- not so much frequency, but distribution more so. So I think the distribution matters, but it's a much smaller lever than just getting enough total protein in. And then as far as animal versus plant, I used to be in the camp of, there's no way somebody can build as much muscle on a plant-based diet. And now, I think I've come back to, you can, it just requires a little bit more planning. And I don't want to say always, but it's very difficult to do without an isolated source of protein. So unless you're going to supplement with an isolated plant source of protein, it's very difficult to get enough without going over on total calories because you can figure that, especially, like take somebody who may be calorically restricted, trying to get enough protein from whole intact plant sources. So you've got a few different things working against you. One, the sources of protein you're consuming also have carbohydrate and/or fat. Two, it's a less bioavailable form of protein, and three, it's a lower quality of protein in terms of it has, typically, less leucine, less branched amino acids, and less essential amino acids. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You answer the question that I almost interrupted you to ask, which was, does it boil down to the leucine content? And it sounds like that is one of the components. And that a lot of the vegan and vegetarian sources of excellent protein, that excellent protein vegetarian or vegan source is co-packaged with calories from carbohydrates and/or fat that make it hard to stay under the caloric threshold. Whereas a steak is-- I'm not-- and obviously, people might want to avoid that for ethical reasons. LAYNE NORTON: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's a different matter entirely. But a steak or a piece of chicken or an egg is-- well, an egg has a yolk which is, there's fat there. But is almost a pure protein, fat source. There's no carbohydrate along for the ride. LAYNE NORTON: Right. So I think what I would say is that, you can do it. Takes a little more planning. And you're almost always-- if you're a vegan, especially, you're going to be better off like something with some isolated form of protein or vegan form of protein. Now, this word gets into people say, well, what about the limiting amino acids and those sorts of things? It's a consideration. Some of the better forms of vegan protein in terms of amino acid content are like soy. Now, I hear everybody screaming online about their testosterone levels. In terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone, there was a recent meta analysis looking at soy. And I think if it's your only source of protein, then maybe the dosage is high enough to cause some weird effects. But if you're just using it like once or twice a day, it doesn't seem to have an effect on testosterone or estrogen. So that can be a decent source of protein, because it is a complete protein source. It does have a PD cause of one, which PD cause is basically a measure of protein quality based on, does it provide enough of all the amino acids so that none are limiting? And so soy is one of the only vegan sources that does that. Interestingly, potato protein isolate actually has a similar essential amino acid content to whey. So isolated potato protein. It's just really hard to find. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. LAYNE NORTON: I've been trying to source-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: But vegans take note, vegetarians take note, because-- or vegans rather, because whey is vegetarian, and whey is a very high quality protein as far as-- LAYNE NORTON: Very high quality proteins. And actually-- they're actually creating whey now out of-- I think it's-- I may mischaracterize this. But I believe they're able to produce it out of like yeast or something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. LAYNE NORTON: That-- so for vegans, now, this is a great option because you can have whey that's not animal-based that is going to be every bit as good as an animal-based whey. So I think that's great. Getting to the leucine-- let me go back, sorry. So another reason that using an isolated protein can be helpful is because it's more bioavailable as well when it's been isolated out. When the protein bound up in the actual plant material, it tends to be less bioavailable. Now, cooking can help increase the bioavailability because it breaks some of those bonds and whatnot. But it still seems to be lower. And you don't-- it's really interesting. There was a recent study where they did a corn, wheat, and pea blend of protein versus whey. And basically, the outcome was, 30 grams of each stimulated protein synthesis to a similar degree. But the plasma amino acids in the plant-based protein still did not get as high as with whey. Now, it may be that that's just-- it doesn't matter because once you get to a certain level, you get all the benefits. But I still found it interesting nonetheless that they didn't quite get as high. The other thing to consider with the vegan sources of protein is the leucine content. So one of the studies we did was we looked at wheat, soy, egg, and whey. Isonitrogenous, meaning we equated protein between the groups, isocaloric, we equated calories. And we looked at muscle protein synthesis. And I think this was-- the meals were 15% of total energy from protein. So like your food guide pyramid level of protein. And we saw that in the wheat and soy group, they did not increase muscle protein synthesis, but the egg and whey group increased muscle protein synthesis. Now, what's really interesting is we went back and we took wheat and added free leucine to it to match the leucine content of whey and the protein synthetic response was identical. So again, I don't like to simplify things too much, but leucine appears to really be driving this ship. And I'll never forget, Layman called me into his office one day, and he would always do these thought experiments of-- he liked to think about why something occurs the way it does. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Dangerous territory. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So he would say-- one day, I'll never forget, he said, Layne, why do you think the body evolved to just sense leucine for muscle protein synthesis? And of course, I'm like, I don't know, man. I just work here like. I'm just trying to get my PhD. And he said, well, think about it. You would want something that really wasn't extensively metabolized by the gut and liver, because you would want to show up in the blood in values that reflect what you just ate. Makes sense. And you would want it to have passive diffusion across the muscle cell because you want to be concentration-dependent, which it is. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Get into the tissues and cells that need it most. LAYNE NORTON: Right. So not having active transport, but rather passive transport. So yeah, I thought that was really interesting the way he broke that down. So few different options for the vegan folks out there. You can use an isolated source of protein. And again, like there's going to be good options coming, because this plant-based whey is going to be a great option for folks. You can add free leucine to it, to whatever your source of protein is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just by supplemented leucine powder. LAYNE NORTON: Now, it tastes horrible. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. I think I've heard that. Maybe I've even tried it. LAYNE NORTON: It's completely non-polar, it does not not dissolve in anything And it is gross. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can it be put into capsules? LAYNE NORTON: It can be put in the capsules. Yeah. So you could take a capsule. Like for example, if you're eating your normal meal, you could just take a capsule of like 1 gram of leucine. Is probably going to bump you up enough that you're going to be good to go. And then there's options like blends-- especially, with corn. Corn is actually very high in leucine. That's a percentage of its protein. Now, you've got to remember like, you go eat corn on the cob and you're getting like 2 grams of total protein. So it's not that much leucine. But if you isolate out the protein, put it into a powder, well, now, when you're getting like 80%, 90% of the weight is now protein, corn is actually about 12% leucine in terms of the protein. So a great source of leucine, it is like almost frank deficient in some other amino acids. But you can blend it with a few other sources of protein. Like you could blend it with a soy, a pea, and you can create these complementary blends that would actually have quite a bit of leucine, but also some of the other essential amino acids. So there are options out there for plant-based folks. And I mean, we have seen people who are plant-based build impressive amounts of muscle. There's quite a few bodybuilders that are plant-based. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a lot of the endurance athletes like it. And even though-- when we talk about muscle, we think about muscle building often. Performance in endurance sports. And also just performance for the typical person who's doing some cardiovascular training, hopefully, some resistance training. Also and just living life. I mean, many more people now, it seems are vegan or at least avoiding meat, in particular red meat. I'm not one of those people. I limit the amount, and I certainly focus on the quality of what I eat. But I do eat red meat, which brings me to a question about just generally in terms of food choice, can we come up with a relatively short summary of the following? Tell me if this is correct or not. That most of us should be focused on-- for sake of health span and lifespan, should be focused on ingesting minimally non-processed and minimally processed foods. Maybe even cooking our own food. I realize that's heresy now. But ideally, we would do some of that. And really trying to avoid foods that are highly processed and have lots of sugar. And I'm using this as a segue to get into a question that I really want your answer to. I've been dying to ask you this, which is if sugar intake is not actually going up as much as people think it is, why are people getting so much fatter? So what do you think about just a general statement that we should try and eat foods that are low to no-- minimally to not processed for about 80% of our foods. Is that a reasonable number? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. It's hard to actually get completely unprocessed food because almost everything goes through some form of processing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm thinking like anything that wouldn't survive long without refrigeration-- LAYNE NORTON: On shelf? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. On a shelf, like an apple or a banana. So like oatmeal, like ground oats to me as long as there isn't a bunch of other stuff and they would be minimally processed. A steak is not really processed, although it's cut off the animal, et cetera. So there's a few steps in there. But that's what I mean. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: And I think everybody gets the gist. I'm probably a little bit pedantic when it comes to this stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, this is good. Actually, one of the things I appreciate about you is something that I get teased a lot by people close to me, which is the caveats and the insistence on precision is really important because especially with online communications these days, it's like a runaway train. People will-- LAYNE NORTON: It's too easy to misinterpret what you're saying. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very easy to misinterpret it. And the misinterpretations are often used to leverage whole new ideas about what is and isn't true. Mostly about what is true. So I really appreciate the nuance. And this is what a longform podcast really allows us to do, is catch every curve, you know? LAYNE NORTON: So I would 100% agree with what you said. That if you were going to make a broad stroke, that trying to focus on minimally processed foods is very important. The one caveat I would say is, I think it's important to understand why. Because otherwise, people can make this weird association that, if I eat any minimally-- or any processed food, it's going to kill me. Or like every time I eat it, it's like I'm smoking a cigarette and my health-- my longevity is declining. Based on the studies we have, it's mostly about the energy. That processed food just gets people to spontaneously eat more. And Kevin Hall showed this in his study that was very-- I mean, he designed some of the most elegant studies in nutrition. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's great. LAYNE NORTON: And they, basically, took people from a minimally processed food diet, and then gave them access to ultra processed foods. Very few instructions. Just eat to you feel satisfied. And they spontaneously increased their calorie intake by 500 calories a day. I mean, that's massive. And we haven't quite figured it out. People say, well, it's sugar. It doesn't appear to be sugar in terms of just an isolation. Well, it's fats. Doesn't appear to be fats in isolation. Well, it's the combination of sugar and fat. Partly, well, it's the combination of sugar, fat and salt. Partly. But there's some kind of overall magic to the texture and the mouthfeel and just the overall palatability of stuff. Which is always why I say, there's like right and wrong ways to these different diets. Like, for example, like there's the right way to do plant-based and then there's like what's in some of these documentaries where they're eating like plant-based mac and cheese. And again, I love a good mac and cheese, but that should not form-- that should not be pitched as a healthy diet. just because it's "plant-based." Because I mean, you're eating a highly processed food that's very palatable and easy to overeat. Same thing for keto. You've now got like keto ice creams and you've got keto cookies and all these sorts of things. And I'm like, yeah, and if you look at them, they actually have more calories than the normal stuff. And I'm like, yeah, this is completely missing the point here. Like you're actually just taking yourself-- the whole point of those diets is the reason you tend to lose weight is originally like good luck 10 years ago, doing a keto diet, eating processed food. Like you just couldn't do it, really. Now, you can. But the problem is, it's not going to work because you're going to be still consuming too many calories, because even though it's keto, what are they doing? Well, they're trying to make it more palatable, they're trying to make it better mouthfeel, which, I guess, if you're being keto for the sake of being keto, great, but if you have hopes of body composition modification, it's going to really negatively impact. So yes, I think minimizing the amount of processed foods you consume can be important. Now that being said, it depends on the individual and their goals. If your goal is to, for example, build muscle or maintain a high body weight for a sport, for example, like an NFL offensive lineman or something of that nature, or if you're-- I worked with an NBA team, they were kind of-- I can't disclose anything, but they were looking at drafting a certain player. And like for them, processed foods may actually be a tool. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or a teenagers. We all want young people to eat more healthily, I think. Develop great habits. But some of them, their caloric needs are so high-- LAYNE NORTON: So high. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --that if they were eating what I eat, they're going to dissolve into-- they'll just waste away. LAYNE NORTON: So I describe this, again, with a financial example. It's like a budget. So if I make a million dollars a year, for example, is it OK for me to buy like a $100,000 sports car? Let's assume that loans don't exist. Is it OK for me to buy a $100,000 sports car if I still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities and take care of my responsibilities-- the things I should do. Is OK if I do that if it makes me feel good and it's fun? ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK by me. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. It's fun. Like it fits in your budget. If I make 50 grand a year, should I be going out and buying a sports car? Probably not, because I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage and all these other responsibilities. So your protein, your, fiber your micronutrients. These are your responsibilities. But those become much easier to hit when you have higher calories. So if you're eating 4,000 calories a day for whatever goal you have, you're probably going to have some left over and like good luck eating 4,000 calories from minimally processed foods, quite frankly, you'll be miserable because you're going to have such gut feel that you're going to feel like you can't even move. And so again, now, it becomes OK, well, is there something inherent to that food processing? Is there something that we can pick out that we know, OK, well, this is going to be a negative effect on health, even like body composition stuff aside. And I would say, there's not really great evidence of that so far. And a great example of that is sugar. I mean, I actually just wrote a really long article on my website about why I think sugar was not the root cause of the obesity epidemic. And you mentioned sugar intake in the last 20 years has actually gone down a little bit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Alcohol intake, well, if you look on the whole it, might have gone up a little bit, but certain certainly in the male sector, it's gone way down drinking. Used to be-- there was a 5 o'clock. People were drinking all day. People are smoking a lot less. I think it's a real puzzle. I'd love to know what your hypotheses are. LAYNE NORTON: Well, smoking could actually be in opposition because nicotine is actually an appetite suppressant. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Appetite suppressant and also increases focus. The problem is it often arrives in a delivery device that can kill you. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But nicotine itself is a powerful agent. It also can offset age-related cognitive decline not entirely, but it makes the brain work better. LAYNE NORTON: I've got a buddy who doesn't like caffeine. And he just takes those nicotine pouches and, basically, has one in almost all day because he's like-- he has a very stressful job and he's a high performer. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You have to be careful how you deliver it, but there's a Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist that will chew five or six pieces of Nicorette an hour, which I do not recommend, but when he quit smoking, he just simply couldn't function as well. And he was the one who pointed me to do the literature on offsetting age-related cognitive decline. Even neuron maintenance, and it's pretty interesting. LAYNE NORTON: Well, it's a pretty impressive nootropic to be honest. Now, the first thing to realize is when we're talking about consumption data, this is based on actual production, basically. They're assuming that, OK, we're producing this amount of these foods, so we can assume the consumption is going to follow that. So it's not a direct measurement. But it has been validated in a few different studies. We know that oil consumption has gone up. Like that that's, yeah. That's one of the big ones. And this forms the crux of-- like, the seed oils are like the root of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's definitely the question that I'm going to ping you on. LAYNE NORTON: They're going to come into your house and kick your dog and punch your mom, and all kinds of stuff. And I'm happy to address those. So calories have still gone up. There's some people who claim that they've gone-- they've plateaued. I think the data seems to suggest that calorie intake is still increasing. And the other thing to keep in mind is, even if it's plateaued, it's still at a high enough level that obesity is probably going to continue to increase up to a point where it'll probably plateau if calories have plateaued. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about energy output? Leaving aside NEAT, because that sounds highly individual, I mean, people are-- the people we know are focusing on exercise. But there are a lot of folks out there that don't exercise. LAYNE NORTON: And energy output has gone down over the years. I mean, it's very obvious when you look at how people work now compared to even 30, 40 years ago. It's much different. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Less walking. Also, I learned recently that kids in high school don't take PE class in many schools. But we had to suit up and run and suit up. And if you didn't bring your change of clothes or you didn't wash them in which case you'd be better off just not wearing them, nothing like the smell of a boys locker room after a weekend, I can still remember it and it's not pleasant. But you had to run and do your pushups with everybody else or play volleyball in your regular school day clothes. So my understanding is that, physical education is not part of the basic education any longer. LAYNE NORTON: It probably depends on the state, but I know many states have done away with it just because of budget cuts. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So activity is going down, caloric intake is going up. Maybe-- LAYNE NORTON: Plateauing a little bit, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --maybe plateauing. Is that sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic? LAYNE NORTON: Based on what I've seen, I think it's pretty sufficient. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it might not be that big of a mystery after all? LAYNE NORTON: No, I don't think it's a big mystery. I think that people don't like the concept of energy balance, and I think because they insert judgment into it, which is, OK, if you're gaining weight over time, at a fundamental level, it means you are eating-- you're consuming more energy than you're expending. People insert the judgment, which is, you're lazy, you're a sloth, or whatever it is. And I think there's a lot of people out there who actually think that, I actually remember talking to somebody who was like, well, I would never hire an obese person for a job because it's just obvious that they're lazy. And I just remember going, are you serious? Like, there are plenty of very, very smart high-achieving people who are obese. And like it's not-- this is what happens when you just put people in buckets. People are much more complicated than this. Yes. There is some personal responsibility. But then when you look through the data and you take-- there was a study done in obese women where they found that women who were obese were 50% more likely to have had some form of sexual assault trauma in their past. We know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be obese. There's several people who have a higher ACE score, I believe, which of measures like traumatic childhood events. I believe, there was a study showing they're more likely to be obese. So there's-- yes, it is an energy imbalance problem, but just saying, eat less, move more, that's like telling broke people, well, just earn more money than you spend. It's technically right, but it's very unhelpful. What is more helpful is to describe and implement the habits and behaviors that will allow them to achieve that. So I realized we go off track a little bit, but circling back to sugar, circa 2005, I believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health independent of any other variable. So independent risk factor. And again, I want to be very clear about what independent means. Independent means independent of all of the variables. This thing is bad for your health and body composition. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So on its own, independent of whether or not, for instance, it increases hunger and appetite. LAYNE NORTON: Right. Or caloric intake. I was at a graduate school mixer. And one of the professors there was somebody who had done research on high fructose corn syrup and fructose, specifically, as well. And he was talking to another professor and he had done this study in rodents where he had fed like-- I think it was like 60% or 70% of their calories from fructose. And they saw some really weird things happen in the liver with lipogenesis and all this kind of stuff. And the other professor is saying to him, yeah, it's pretty obvious that high fructose corn syrup is fattening. And this professor who had done this research said, yeah, because it's people overeat. And he's like, don't you think there's something inherent to it? And he said, no, I think it's just calories. People are eating too many calories. He's like, we did a proof of concept looking at could we-- like, try eating 70% of your daily calories from fructose. You actually can't do it. High fructose, corn syrup is only 55% fructose. So if you ate nothing but high fructose, corn syrup, you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study. So that got me kind of like questioning my beliefs about it. So then I went through and I said, OK, look, let's take out the epidemiology. Not that epidemiology is useless, but people who eat more sugar are also likely to eat more calories. So then I looked for the randomized controlled trials where they match calories and vary the amount of sugar. And it doesn't seem to make a difference. At least from fat loss or fat gain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what about health? So for instance, if somebody-- and I know somebody like this who loves sweets, is thin, get some exercise, not a ton. But my concern is that, a significant fraction of their calories are coming from these sugary foods and therefore they're not getting enough fiber-- maybe protein, et cetera. LAYNE NORTON: So let's look at epidemiology for a second, then I'll address this more directly. When we look at epidemiology, people who eat higher amounts of sugar tend to be more obese, they tend to have worse biomarkers of health. The people who eat fruit-- a lot of fruit sugar, don't have those same associations. So why is that? Well, because fruit has fiber with it. So I started to believe, based on the data I was looking at, that high sugar intake was not the problem per se. The problem was that high sugary foods, typically, are very low in fiber. But if you're getting enough fiber, is sugar a problem? So there was a classic study by Surwit in 1997. I think it's still the best studies of this day looking at this. And I know those people who say, well, it was done in 1997. It has no relevance. You know, I know, if it's a good study, it's a good study. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Some studies are timeless. In fact, they have greater relevance-- LAYNE NORTON: You're not going to go back and undo the discovery of DNA because it was 60 years ago or whatever it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. LAYNE NORTON: So they looked at an 1,100-calorie diet, so low calorie diet. One group was eating over 110 grams of sugar a day, like sucrose. The other group was eating about 10 grams of sugar per day. Calories, protein, carbs, fats all matched. And they provided all the meals to these participants. So very tightly controlled. And it was over six weeks. Both groups lost the exact same amount of body fat. So it doesn't seem to matter for body composition in terms of sugar per se. Then they also looked at some biomarkers of health like blood lipids and blood sugar and some other things. Again, there was no real differences. The only difference was-- so all their biomarkers improved in both groups. The only real difference was a small difference in LDL. So the group eating low sugar had a better improvement slightly in LDL. But that's probably because they were eating more fiber. And we know fiber can bind to cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol. So now, I want to caveat this. Sugar probably doesn't have any positive health effects. So there's that. And nutrition is an exchange. If you're eating one thing, you're not eating another thing, right? So but what I would tell people is, focus probably less on sugar, focus more on fiber. So if you're eating 30, 40, 50, 60 grams of fiber a day, but your sugar is, 80, 90 grams, I would not be that worried about it, especially, if you're controlling calories as well. What I would be worried about is if you're eating just a decent amount of calories and not getting enough fiber and in general, right? And even in studies, there's a few meta analyzes out now looking at isoenergetic exchange of different carbohydrates with sugar carbohydrates. So fructose and glucose and sucrose. Now, why is this important? Well, again, if you're not equate-- when I say isoenergetic, that means equal in energy, equal in calories. So basically, when they exchange either sucrose or glucose or fructose for other forms of carbohydrate, do they see differences in these markers of health? Like HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, with rare exceptions, and I can't remember all the data points exactly. But the take home is, doesn't really seem to make a difference? Now, for anybody out there, straw man is my argument, I am not advocating for sugar consumption. But I think it's important for people to not create weird associations in their minds because one of the things I've observed, especially, in the fitness industry, is when people feel like they can't eat something-- it's one thing if you say, I am choosing not to eat this just because I'm choosing to. But it's a very different thing when you're purposely restricting because you feel like something is bad. And this-- I mean, you know the human brain is, in many ways, amazing and in many ways, really dumb. So when you purposely try to restrict something, what tends to happen is you're more prone to binge on it. So people who will try to-- well, I'm never going to eat you know sugar again or I'm going to try and limit sugar. And this isn't the case for everybody. But they have actually shown now in studies, people who are purposely restricting a specific nutrient, they tend to crave more of that nutrient. And if they do get exposed to it, they're more likely to have what's called a disinhibition reflex, which is basically a binge response. Because the thinking goes, well, this is bad, and there's no context on dosage making the poison. This is just bad in general. So if I have it, I've already screwed up. I might as well just have as much as I want. And I like Spencer Nadolsky's comparison to this. That's like getting a flat and then going out and slashing your other three tires because you might as well. So I really-- I try to come from that perspective of, I've seen so many people struggle with, maybe, not an eating disorder, but disordered eating patterns because of these associations they've made in their mind. And so that's why I'm so pedantic and a stickler about saying, OK, yes, it's a good idea to eat mentally processed food and try to avoid processed foods. But not because processed foods are bad per se, but what the outcome tends to be from a lot of processed food consumption, which is overconsuming calories and then therefore energy toxicity negatively contributing to your health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It seems like it, again, returns to the potential for a positive, negative, or neutral behavioral change. And perceptual change of like craving of food all the time that you can have is terrible. That's a terrible state to be in. And this, I think, is a perfect segue way for something that first brought us together, which was this thing about artificial sweeteners. And let me just, for the record, be very clear. I have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners. So throughout graduate school, I didn't have the best habits. They're healthier now than they were back then. But I would drink a Diet Coke or two per day. I still have the occasional Diet Coke, I'm not completely averse to drink something that has artificial sweetener. Although, I do avoid sucralose for reasons that maybe I can get into a little bit later. But a lot of the things I consume contain stevia, which is not artificial but it is a plant-based non-caloric-- or low caloric sweetener. And I don't have a problem with that. I became very interested in artificial sweeteners because of the animal data pointing to the idea that they may disrupt the gut microbiome, and then disrupt the gut microbiome, as you pointed out, is a very broad statement. We don't really know the percentage of lactobacillus, exobacilius, or whatever ilius in there-- they all seem to end in ilius-- is ideal. And in fact, a lot of these companies that are having people send in their stool samples for analysis of the microbiome. I mean, take note, we don't really know what a healthy microbiome looks like, but we know what an unhealthy microbiome might look like. And it's one that doesn't have a lot of diversity in there. So I was interested in that, then there's the recent human study which we should definitely get into. But I was mostly interested in artificial sweeteners for the reason that there is this food conditioning effect. And you see it in animals and you see it in humans that if you ingest-- well, coffee is a really good example. Coffee doesn't actually taste good folks, even though I like it. But when you taste coffee for the first time, most people think it's bitter and disgusting. Most, everybody, like 95% of people say, this doesn't taste good. LAYNE NORTON: Wine, beer are same thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. But people have learned to associate the state of being caffeinated, which most people like in order to just feel normal, right, caffeine is one of the few drugs we ingest just to feel ourselves enough that soon-- myself included, really look forward to and enjoy a cup of coffee. So it's a powerful example, in my opinion, of the food conditioning effect. So it's like a Pavlovian thing. Instead of salivating, you crave. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it did seem that this study from Dana Small's lab, which admittedly was a small no pun intended study itself, not very many subjects, showed that if you ingested artificial sweeteners along with food that contained glucose, that you could maybe even get a heightened glucose response just from the artificial sweeteners after a while. You and I connected over this study on social media. You pointed out that the design, the study wasn't superb. There was co-consumption of glucose, which made it complicated. We can go into that. But the reason I'm spouting off all this context is, artificial sweeteners are many things. So I'd like to talk about their effects on blood sugar in the acute sense and according to what we might ingest them with and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level of brain and/or body. And then the gut microbiome data, I think, are interesting enough to discuss. And I have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you've taught me. So this is a case where I've completely changed my view, which is that, now, I don't have any problem with them whatsoever based on the current data, which is not to say that I'm gulping down cup fulls of sucralose, but I feel OK ingesting some stevia and some aspartame and I'm not too worried about it. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So I think stepping back from a broad view, we have to think about, again, the hierarchy of importance. And what are you replacing with? So there is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drinks sugar sweetened beverages and have them drink an artificially sweetened beverage. In the meta analysis, there was actually a recent network meta analysis looking at markers of adiposity, HbA1c, a bunch of different health markers, and when you substitute, we'll call it non-nutritive sweeteners, and stevia is not artificial. But so when you substitute NNS for the sugar-sweetened beverages, you see improvements in a lot of different things. What was really interesting about this network meta analysis was they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar-sweetened beverages. And the effect wasn't as powerful as-- and these are randomized controlled trials. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So artificial sweetener containing beverages are more beneficial-- LAYNE NORTON: Were better for adiposity-- for improving adiposity, and then in the health markers, it was kind of a wash. Water and non-nutritive sweetener, beverages performed similar. But there were better than sugar-sweetened beverages, obviously. So they then based on-- a network meta analysis is where you can compare to things that didn't get compared directly. So there's not many studies comparing NNS versus water directly. But if you have a common comparator, so if you compare A to B and B gets compared to C, you compare A to C based on how they interacted with B. Butchering it a little, bit but that's the crux of a network meta analysis. So they looked at NNS versus water and found that actually, in NNS was slightly better for improving adiposity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: NNS, of course, being non-nutritive sweeteners. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: So now, again, if you like drinking water and you don't want to-- I'm not trying to convince anybody to do that. What that seems to suggest is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressant effect from these artificial sweeteners or non-nutritive sweeteners. Now, this gets a little bit more complicated because if these were people drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, maybe they've already developed a sweet taste and try to go to water, it's too much of a jump for them. And so going to having something like intermediate is a little bit better. Like, there's a lot wrapped up in this. But these are the randomized controlled trials, which are a little bit more tightly controlled, which I tend to default to a little bit more than I do the epidemiology, which epidemiology is just so messy, because sure, non-nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things, but there's also a whole other set of lifestyle and habits that are tied up in that. So I tend to hang my hat a little bit more on the randomized controlled trials. So understanding that. OK. Now, all things being equal, understanding that this is a tool that may help some people, and whenever I post about non-nutritive sweeteners in the comments, there's always one or two or three people who say, all I did was cut out soda. And I drank diet soda instead, and I lost 50 pounds. Or I lost 75 pounds. I even had 1%. I lost 100 pounds. That's the only thing I did. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. LAYNE NORTON: I mean, that's a pretty massive lever to pull. If you consider somebody who might be having like, I mean, five or six Cokes a day, I mean, we're talking a serious amount of calories. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that also means that by replacing it with artificial sweetener-containing beverages, they did not replace the soda with food. LAYNE NORTON: Correct. So now, let's talk about, right? This is where we can get into the micro analysis, but is that obese person who lost 100 pounds by doing that? Do I really care about, maybe, a small alteration to their gut microbiome? No, because their gut microbiome is actually much more healthy now by them having lost all that excess adipose tissue. So again, the ranking of what I'm worried about can change depending on the specific situation. Now, let's take somebody like me who's lean and doesn't really have any health problems that I'm aware of. What about artificial sweeteners for me? Well, for me, I got using them because of bodybuilding contest prep, because it was about the only appetite suppressant that worked for me. But do I think that they are healthful? Probably not. Do I think they're unhealthy? I would say based on the current data, I don't think that they're unhealthy. Now, the information on blood glucose. So there's-- some of the problems with some of these meta analyzes or these reviews is they lump all the non-nutritive sweeteners together and then they may say, well, there's no effect on this or there's an effect on this. Well, the problem is these are different molecules and they can interact differently. Aspartame, very clearly, seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insulin. That has been repeatedly shown. Stevia doesn't appear to have much effect. Saccharin and sucralose, the jury is mixed. Now, there was the study that we first connected on which, I think, their primary outcome measure was actually they were looking at the sweet taste. Like how it affected sweet taste. So what they did was, the group that was getting the sucralose was also paired with maltodextrin. The control group was getting sucrose, which is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste because maltodextrin is not as sweet as sucrose. So when you're trying to combine sucralose, which is already sweet, with another form of carbohydrate, you'd want something less sweet compared to your control. But for the outcome measure of insulin and blood glucose, probably, not as appropriate because we know maltodextrin has a much higher glycemic index than sucrose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they appropriately controlled for taste, but not for the effect of the sweeteners. And I think that that was a key component. And I think, yeah, the part of that study that intrigued me actually was in a talk version of that because that study drove me to watch a talk that-- and we'll get Dana Small on the podcast at some point, hopefully-- was that they had kids do this study. And they actually had to cease the study because a couple of the kids became prediabetic. I mean, it seemed like there was something hazardous about-- this was the Yale School of Medicine. It's a good place. I mean, there's a range everywhere. But it just seemed like there's something about sweet taste that if taken to the extreme might be able to impact blood sugar. This has impacted my behavior. And I try to avoid really sweet things, unless they're exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them because I do think that it increases my craving for sweet things. LAYNE NORTON: Well, it might not be necessarily a craving, but it just programs you. Your taste buds are extremely adaptable. So take, for example, Indian food. If you bring Indian people over to America and have them eat some of our food, they think it tastes extremely bland because they're used to such spicy food that unless they have a certain level of spice, they can hardly even taste it. If you've ever done a high-sodium diet and then gone to a low-sodium diet, it feels very bland. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's where I started from. LAYNE NORTON: But over time, your taste buds adjust. So sweet is the same thing. If you're used to eating a lot of sweet, you get desensitized to it. And then if you go to something less sweet, it can taste-bland at first. Over time, it'll get better. So I think it's one of those things that, again, it depends on the situation. If somebody's obese and they said, well, this is going to help me eliminate sugar-sweetened beverage, why would you want to take that tool away from them? That's a great lever to pull. I mean, if somebody can lose literally 100 pounds from just one change in lifestyle that's not even really that inconvenient of a change, that is powerful. But again, is it the most healthy thing they could do? And I think that's what tends to get asked. We don't know. Is it healthier than water? Probably not maybe as healthy as it. Who knows? But I really make all those caveats because you don't want to have people who could use this as a tool to think, well, no, I can't do this because it's actually bad for me. If it helps you lose 50 pounds or 75 pounds or whatever it is, trust me, it's not bad for you, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it does seem to increase your satiety signals. What do you think about the microbiome effects in this recent study? Because the recent study, I think, had some nice features to it. And you've done a detailed description of the study. So for those that want that-- LAYNE NORTON: Is this the two-week study or the 10-week? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, the two-week study. Yeah. And we will provide a link. You did an excellent video on your YouTube channel that really parses each piece. But they compared the various artificial sweeteners and looked at the glucose response, looked at microbiome, a number of different measures. What was your general takeaway? And this was in humans for, I think, the first time looking at microbiome in humans due to artificial sweetener-- LAYNE NORTON: There are a few studies on the microbiome in humans with artificial sweeteners. The first two that came out showed pretty much no effect, but they were a little bit shorter in duration. They were two to four weeks. And again, it depends on what bacteria are getting measured. There's many different kinds of bacteria, so they could just be measuring one that didn't change. And then there was a 10-week study that came out that got a lot of press. And they showed-- I think it was sucralose. I think. They showed an effect of change on the gut microbiome. Now, what was interesting is when I went into the species that changed, the species that changed the most compared to the control was a species called-- I'm going to butcher the name, but it's like Blautia coccoides, I think it's called. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I must say for those that work on the microbiome, it's so difficult to pronounce. I mean, you need a nomenclature committee, and you need acronyms. I'm sorry. Just do it. LAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Enough already. You're killing us. LAYNE NORTON: We'll call it BC. We call it BC. ANDREW HUBERMAN: BC, thank you. We're going to start the nomenclature committee without you if you don't do it soon. LAYNE NORTON: So they noticed that this went up by, like, three- to four-fold. So I kind of went down the rabbit hole on this. So interestingly, that particular species of bacteria is actually associated with lower adiposity, better insulin sensitivity. And people who are obese and children who are obese tend to have less of it. So I said, well, based on that study, you can actually argue that maybe sucralose actually improves the gut microbiome. Now, again, I'm not making that claim. Because we have a hard time understanding what a healthy microbiome looks like already. This last study that came out, my biggest take-home was I think it's safe to say that some of these non-nutritive sweeteners are not metabolically inert. There are some effects. Now, are those effects good, bad, or neutral I think has yet to be fully elucidated. Now, I focused more on the blood-glucose responses in my analysis. So in that 10-week study, they did oral-glucose tolerance test. And their conclusion I didn't really feel like fit their data. So their conclusion was that-- and again, I think it was sucralose-- that it elevated blood glucose. [SIGHS] And this is where statistics can get kind of tricky. So my take-home was the area under the curve, the incremental area under the curve, which is looking at basically the entire glucose response, was not different between the control and the sucralose group. To me, that's the biggest take-home. There was one time point at the end of the study in the sucralose group, the 30-minute time point, that was statistically significantly higher blood glucose than the control group. It's kind of one of those things where I go, OK, it was one time point. It's statistically significant. But even then, we've seen things be statistically significant that end up being data artifacts because they're not reproduced. So I'm not saying that's what's happening here. But again, the overall area under the curve was not different. So to me, that was the biggest take-home. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And papers, we should probably mention, are published because of effects, generally. [CHUCKLES] Lack of effect, harder to publish. LAYNE NORTON: Null hypothesis doesn't-- it's actually really unfortunate because a null hypothesis is just as useful data as the non-null hypothesis. But you're right. There is a very strong publication bias towards showing an effect versus not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, unless you can flip a field on its head entirely by showing something did not happen, typically the positive result out does the negative result, positive meaning you see a result. And then of course, it's one study. And-- LAYNE NORTON: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think that, as you talked about earlier, the center of mass of data in a given field are probably the best basis for what we should do in terms of-- and so I'm not changing my behavior around the intake of artificial sweeteners. I personally am still going to consume stevia and aspartame in relatively small amounts. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But now I'm thinking, well, OK, if something contains sucralose, I don't have to perhaps actively avoid it. Whereas before I was. I was actively avoiding it. LAYNE NORTON: So the new study I thought was very elegantly-- very involved. I mean, to be quite frank, some of the animal stuff they did was extremely impressive. So there was actually two arms to the study. One was the human arm. One was the animal arm. I focused much more on the human side of it. So basically, this was a two-week study. And the really unique aspect of this, which I think is both a strength and a weakness, they had almost 1,400 people apply for this study. And they only had 120, I think, that actually went into it. Because they did a very detailed food analysis of these folks. All of these people said that they avoided artificial sweeteners or didn't consume them. And I think people don't realize how ubiquitous sweeteners are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Prior to the study, these people were like-- it was like jury selection. They'd never-- LAYNE NORTON: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like not ever hearing of the plaintiff and the defendant. These are these mutant people who have never had an artificial sweetener. LAYNE NORTON: Right, so the strength is now you don't have a lot of preexisting effects that may be clouding what would actually happen when you add it in. For example, if you have people who are already consuming artificial sweeteners and then you have them consume artificial sweeteners, the likelihood things are going to change is pretty low, right? So I think that that's a strength. It's also a weakness. And I want to be really careful because I think people took my words a little bit too far, which means I probably didn't do a good job of being nuanced enough. There is the possibility for a placebo effect here. So to me, if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweeteners, it's likely they have a preconceived notion that those are bad for you, because they're difficult to avoid. Yes, it's possible if they're eating a very minimally processed diet that they're just not exposed to them. And that's very true, as well. But the other thing that the researchers acknowledged was they weren't able to blind the study. Because if you've never had an artificial sweetener before, you're only used to regular sugar and you have an artificial sweetener, you know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You taste it. LAYNE NORTON: You know. It's still sweet. But it's not the same sweet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there's an interesting effect there, where a lot of people don't like the taste of aspartame the first time. I actually quit drinking diet soda for a while, thinking I should, and then had one. It tasted really-- I can only describe it as kind of artificial, chemical. And then pretty soon, it tasted great again. LAYNE NORTON: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so there is some attenuation there. And whether or not that's central, meaning within the brain, or peripheral, I don't know. But very interesting. Well, I see you as playing a critical role in defining what is and what isn't, what still needs to be determined in terms of this landscape and the entire landscape really of nutrition. LAYNE NORTON: And that study did change my opinion in terms of, OK, I think we can clearly say now that these aren't neutral. Or sorry, that they're not inert, right? That was the thought process before, was well. They're not digested or whatnot, so they must be inert. That doesn't appear to be the case. But again, when we look at the blood glucose data, there's-- and I'm not saying this is what happened. I want to be very clear. I'm not saying this is what happened. I'm saying it's possible this happened. And so this is why we need more studies to verify. If these people had a preconceived notion that artificial sweeteners were bad for them, it's possible, knowing they're ingesting artificial sweeteners that they could have had a blood glucose response. Now, my pushback on my own point there would be, then we should have expected to see it in all the non-nutritive sweeteners, which they didn't. It was just in sucralose and saccharin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, it was kind of a graded effect, where sucralose and saccharin showed the most dramatic change. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And stevia and a few of the others did not. LAYNE NORTON: And the other issue I took with it-- maybe it's a ticky-tack thing-- was their primary outcome measure was blood glucose, the oral-glucose tolerance test. But they had people administer their own oral-glucose tolerance tests, which basically they gave them-- they said, OK, drink this drink. And they were wearing continuous glucose monitors, which should have been fine. But again, to me-- and I'm being ticky tacky. And again, I know all studies are limited by funding. So I think overall, this was a great study. But I would have liked to have seen them monitor the oral-glucose tolerance tests to administer it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, and what they did before or after. You want to know that they didn't ingest this or did ingest that. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LAYNE NORTON: Those two things. But one other caveat is it was a two-week study. So we've got to be really careful how much we interpret in this because it's also possible that this is a transient effect, right? And maybe it goes away over time. We don't know. But again, I think we can clearly say it's not inert, right? Now, how much emphasis we put on that, on a two-week study, I still will say, OK, maybe if you're worried, don't consume sucralose. But if you're 100 pounds overweight and you want to use some sucralose as a replacement to help you lose weight, I would say, don't let this study deter you from doing that because the net effect is still going to be more positive than you not losing the weight, right? So if it's a tool that helps you, fine. But I do hold open the idea that, well, there could be negative effects from it, as well. But again, we're looking at, what is the overall outcome? And then they examined some of the different things that were increased with these different sweeteners. And again, this word gets messy because one of the things they saw was a big increase in butyrate production from the change in the gut microbiome presumably. Well, as we discussed earlier, butyrate's actually associated with positive outcomes in terms of insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and some other things. So I want to be real cautious before people say, well, if there's a change in the microbiome, it must be a bad change. We don't know. It's possible. And again, if we have 10 more studies come out and start to show this, then I will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweeteners. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So in anticipation of sitting down today, I did solicit for questions on social media. And one of the questions that got a lot of upvotes, likes if you will, was one that I think raises interesting questions about short-term and long-term health. And it's the following. I think it's a common scenario. A number of people want to know, what is the healthiest way to approach a rapid weight loss? And here what I think is happening is somebody has an event coming up or they're just tired of being the weight they are, carrying the amount of adipose tissue they are. And they wanted to know whether or not it is safe to, for instance, lose three pounds a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding or some other event and whether or not straight caloric restriction and increasing activity is the best way to approach that, with the understanding that they may gain back a little afterwards. I think ideally they'd like to maintain it afterwards. But what do you think of that approach, cutting caloric intake in half, for instance, and then also doubling your physical output? LAYNE NORTON: So it's interesting because you might be surprised by what I'm going to say, which is the research data actually tends to suggest that people who are obese, who lose a lot more weight early, are more likely to keep it off, which seems a little bit contradictory, right? Like, well, that doesn't seem very sustainable. But again, you're weighing competing things. So there's the sustainability aspect. But then there's also-- buy-in is huge for sustainability. So for a lot of overweight or obese people, if they start a diet and they don't see something quickly, they bail on it because it's not working. Whereas if they see some rapid results pretty quickly, they buy in even harder. And so I think that the conversation, especially for if there's any coaches or trainers out there, is just presenting that as the-- one of my favorite lines is there are no solutions. There's only trade-offs. I think Thomas Sowell said that. So you're having a trade-off here. Yes, you're going to lose fat faster. You might lose lean mass a little bit faster too, which can be a problem. But I will say, the more adipose tissue you have, the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences. Somebody like me doing a really aggressive diet is not going to be good for my lean mass. One, I have a higher lean mass than normal. Two, I have a lower body fat than normal. As your body fat goes down, the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up. So people who are very obese, because they have so much adipose tissue to pull from, there's very little reason for the body to metabolize lean tissue. Now, that being said, if you go on a-- people misinterpret, like, well, I got an in-body done or a DEXA done and I've lost 2 pounds of lean mass, and they've lost 20 pounds overall. Well, keep in mind, adipose tissue itself is 13% lean mass. So there's actually a protein component to-- the structural component of the adipose tissue. And it does have some water. So it's about 87% lipid. But the other part is lean. So at minimum, you should expect a 13% reduction in lean mass when you diet. And then when you consider like, you lose body water overall, which registers as lean mass, and you lose your splenic tissues can shrink a little bit. So it's normal for the average person to lose 25% or 30% of the weight that they lose from "lean mass." But that doesn't mean skeletal muscle tissue. And again, the more adipose you have, the more aggressively you can approach the diet without really negative long-term consequences to lean mass or your overall health. But balance that with, OK, if I'm going to do this, I need to understand that I'm not going to be dieting this way forever. I'm doing this to give myself a boost at the beginning. And I have to be OK at some point with transitioning to something that's a little bit more sustainable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Based on what you just said, it reminds me of the satiety signal effect of exercise you mentioned earlier, that exercising can improve our sense of when we've had enough to eat. I just want to briefly mention that when Alia Crum was on the podcast, she mentioned that they'd been doing a study that-- I have to pair you two and hear the conversation as a fly on the wall. Because what she was telling me was that if people believe that a food is nutritious for them, then eating less of it registers as more satiating. Whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system, like, oh, dieting is hard, and the food sucks, and it's terrible, well, then they crave all sorts of other things. Whereas they actually observe in their studies where people report reduced craving if they are told, for instance, a chicken breast and broccoli and some olive oil and rice is actually quite nourishing. It's actually really good for you. Then people eat that. And they feel like they've actually eaten more. The satiety signaling goes up. So it's just a point that Alia made. Those aren't my data. LAYNE NORTON: Satiety is so impressive because even the rate at which you eat and right down to the size of the plate and the color of the plate, the contrast in color-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really? LAYNE NORTON: I can't remember exactly. I think it's if the plate is a similar color to the food, I think people eat more. Whereas if it's a bigger contrast, they eat less. So even plate color can make a difference on how much you eat. So again, human brain, very amazing, but also very dumb in some ways, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not an optimized algorithm. LAYNE NORTON: I always joke with people. I'm like, just look at how stupid humans are. You put some water in front of them, like the ocean, they're like, oh, yeah, I'll pay 10 times more for this. [CHUCKLES] But we're kind of wired that way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The reward signaling pathways in the brain run one chemical mainly, dopamine-- there are others, of course-- and very few algorithms. It's sort of like an-- intermittent reinforcement is one, random reinforcement. But in the end, there aren't many algorithms. And we are probably not optimized-- certainly not optimized for our own health because people will eat themselves to death, drug themselves to death, et cetera, simply because something felt good at one point. It proves your point. LAYNE NORTON: Right. One of the things I tell people-- I said this on-- for someone's podcast was, interestingly, the dichotomy of life is if you do what's easy in the short term, your life will be hard. If you do what's hard in the short term, your life will get easier. It's very strange. And actually, Ethan Suplee had a great example of this. When he was over 500 pounds, he said, the amount of work I had to do to construct my life that I could just live was so much more work than just going to the gym for a couple hours a day. He's like, the gym work is hard. He's like, but when I look back at how much work I had to do to sustain that lifestyle versus just going to the gym and restricting calories, he's like, to maintain the lifestyle of being 500 pounds was infinitely more difficult than what I do now. And so again, great example. Short term-- hard. Going to the gym, calorie restriction. Long term, life's easier. Just a really interesting dichotomy I think about a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it can't be restated often enough. Seed oils. People want to ask about seed oils. And for-- LAYNE NORTON: Cut. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for those of you that are listening who are wondering why we're chuckling already, I should mentioned that both in the Twitter sphere and Instagram and online, there are these very polarized views that probably aren't worth focusing on for too long. But there are a number of folks out there who are arguing that seed oils are the source of all-- the obesity epidemic-- LAYNE NORTON: Everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --inflammation, et cetera-- LAYNE NORTON: Illuminati. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --everything. And then there are those that would argue just the opposite, that meat is the source of all problems, et cetera. And I think we've, thanks to your nuance and expertise, we've hopefully appropriately framed things that it's never that black and white. It's simply not. LAYNE NORTON: Rarely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Rarely. I love olive oil. I realize that doesn't fit exactly into the seed oil category. I love olive oil. I use it in moderation. I do also consume some butter in moderation, et cetera. But are there any data on seed oils? And here, a good example I think would be canola oil, which comes from the rape seed, that literally was renamed canola oil because rape seed oil is not good marketing. LAYNE NORTON: No, no. [CHUCKLES] No, exactly. So the first thing I'll say is seed oils have negatively contributed to our overall health because people in the last 20, 30 years, what they have tended to add into their diet that does increase the overall calorie load is oil, mostly from seed oils. But when we look at 1-to-1 replacement with other fats-- if you look at the epidemiology, yeah, you can find some epidemiology showing people who consume more seed oil have more negative health outcomes. Problem is, again, tied up with a multitude of other behaviors. And then you can find mechanisms. And the idea is, well, they're polyunsaturated, which means in the fatty acid chain, there's multiple double bonds, which those double bonds can be oxidized when they're exposed to heat and some other things. And so the idea is, well, when you cook with these things, they make it oxidized. And that's going to cause inflammation in your body. So that's a plausible mechanism. So as always, I defer to the human randomized controlled trials. And so what you tend to find is when you substitute saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats, it's either neutral or positive in terms of the effects on-- inflammation is basically neutral. There's some studies that show a positive effect of doing polyunsaturated fats. But it probably depends on the individual polyunsaturated fat. And that's the other thing that's difficult because you're categorizing everything in this one bucket. And there are some differences between individual fatty acids. Even with saturated fat-- for example, stearic acid doesn't tend to raise LDL cholesterol. Whereas saturated fat as a whole tends to raise LDL cholesterol. But there are some saturated fats that don't. So again, we're putting things in buckets. And it's a little more nuanced than that. Then if you look at the effects of polyunsaturated fats on markers of cardiovascular disease, again, tends to either be a neutral or positive effect when you substitute saturated fat for polyunsaturated fat. Now, if you want to get into monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated, there's quite a bit of disagreement between the studies. What I would say, based on the human randomized controlled trials, is that you're probably better off consuming monounsaturated and polyunsaturated in place of saturated fat. But again, if the idea is, well, that means polyunsaturated are good for me, so I'm just going to dump a bunch of oil on everything and now you're upping your calories, well, that's a negative now because you have to deal with the bigger problem of overall energy toxicity. So I'm not somebody who likes to demonize individual nutrients. I just haven't seen really compelling evidence that seed oils are the root cause of the problems that are being suggested. And I think this is a good example of whenever there's something that pops up in the fitness industry, there's always the opposite thing that pops up and is the reactionary, extreme reaction to whatever this thing was over here. And I think that's what we're seeing with some of the seed oil stuff, is it's mostly people who are trying to espouse the virtues of saturated fat. And listen, I think it's fine to consume some saturated fat. But again, I think limiting it to 7% to 10% of your daily calorie intake is probably wise, again, based on all the consensus of the evidence I've seen. And so once again, we're struggling with this. OK, we've got this epidemiology and these mechanisms that sound good. But then, what actually happens when we do some human randomized controlled trials? And so far, I just haven't seen the evidence to suggest that seed oils are independently bad for you, independent of the calories they contain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You said the words, "overall energy toxicity." And I just want to highlight that I think that's a fabulous term. I don't think enough people think about that because they are primed, or we are all primed, to think, OK, seed oils might be bad. Or artificial sweeteners might be bad. Or this particular component of blood work might represent something good or bad, without taking into account overall energy toxicity, the toxicity of overconsuming calories, energy. And thank you for pointing out that most of the data point to the fact that saturated fat should make up about no more than 7% to 10% of total daily caloric intake. Is there a lower-end threshold that can be problematic? For instance, I've noticed that my blood profiles, especially in terms of hormones, improve when I'm getting sufficient saturated fat. Maybe I'm a mutant. But years ago, because I'm a product of growing up in the '90s, I tried a low-fat diet. It certainly crushed my androgen levels. I started adding some butter back in. And I was right back in the sweet zone, where I wanted to be. So 7% to 10% of total daily caloric intake, I'm guessing, is probably about what I do now. I'll have to check. But is there a danger to going too low in saturated fats? LAYNE NORTON: So again, no solutions, only trade-offs, right? What maximizes out testosterone might not be the best thing for longevity, and vice versa. I'm not making that claim specifically. But I think it's important to understand this that I think we all have this idea that there's this one iconic diet out there that is going to be the best diet for building muscle and burning fat and preventing cancer and heart disease. And the reality is, there's overall healthy dietary patterns that we see that are good for those things. But when we get down into the weeds, there's probably some push and pull here, as well. So when it comes to saturated fat, there is some evidence that if you're too low on it, that yes, you can have a reduction in testosterone. Now, is that reduction in testosterone, let's say 15%, 20%, whatever it may be, is that sufficient to actually cause loss of lean mass? That, we don't know. That's never been shown. Interestingly, I just remembered this. There was one study that was comparing polyunsaturated fat versus saturated fat. And they equated total fat. And one of the really interesting things was the group getting the polyunsaturated fat had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat. Now, it's only one study. I've never seen this replicated. So this is a situation where I say, I would like to find out what the mechanism of that is because this could just be random. But if that gets shown over and over, what I might say is, OK, well, if polyunsaturateds are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat, who cares what happens with testosterone? Unless that reduction in testosterone is causing some kind of impotence for your life, right? So all that to say, I don't really know. And by the way, that's something, for those watching and listening, real experts, every once in a while, you should hear them say the following words "I don't know." [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. My graduate advisor was exceptional at that. And she was brilliant, right? LAYNE NORTON: And then in terms of cholesterol synthesis, you really need a very, very small amount of saturated fat for LDL cholesterol synthesis. Your liver can synthesize-- the amount of LDL cholesterol, or cholesterol that your body requires is so small in terms of just living and being healthy. So I don't think you need to worry about that. And from a cardiovascular disease standpoint, there is some evidence that even taking people who have, quote, unquote, "low LDL" of 80 or 90 and taking them down to like 30 or 40, that there is still a benefit for the risk of cardiovascular disease. So again, you're weighing these two buckets. So what I say, if you're doing 7% and 10% from saturated fat, you're probably fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I received a lot of questions about whether or not there are female-specific diet and exercise protocols. And I realize this is a vast landscape. But some of those questions related to menopause and premenopause. And some related to the menstrual cycle. Most related to variations across the menstrual cycle. In terms of, let's just say diet maintenance or subcaloric diet, are there any things that you've observed? We'll talk a little bit later about this wonderful app that you've produced, this Carbon app which helps people manage their energy intake and a number of other things. And so there, you have a sort of a database, or at least an experience base. And then I'm guessing there are probably also studies exploring male-versus-female differences in terms of adherence and what sorts of diets work. Are there any general themes that one can extract from that? LAYNE NORTON: This is going to be a really unpopular segment for the women. Doesn't seem to make a big difference. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, actually, they may be relieved to hear that because it makes sorting through the information space and certainly the information we've covered in this podcast up until now simpler. It means that everything isn't different for them. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, so if you look at the male-versus-female studies' relation to diet, they seem to respond in a similar way. Like, similar calorie deficit seems to produce similar results. If you do low carb, high carb, regardless, it seems to boil down to the same principles. Now, training wise, we do know that females, the muscle fibers adapt a little bit differently to training. But without getting too far into the weeds, it doesn't really change the way you should train because for the most part, building muscle, there's a lot of different ways to build muscle. So we know that light loads up to maybe 30 reps, as long as it's taken close to failure, have basically the same effect on building muscle, at least in the short term, as heavy loads for low reps. It's mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure. You don't have to go to failure, but getting close, within a few reps. If you're between one rep and 30 reps, if you're getting close to failure, seem to produce similar results. So again, great. You can pick whichever form of discomfort you prefer, right? When it comes to female-specific training, again, females actually-- this is one thing that a lot of people don't know. They actually put on a similar amount of lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men. In fact, there's no statistically significant difference in the amount of lean mass they put on. Now, the absolute amount of lean mass that's added will be greater for men because they started with a greater amount of lean mass. But the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training. Now, females, there's some differences in fiber types, that females tend to be a little bit less fatiguable than men. They can go a little bit harder a little bit longer. And there's also some evidence that they recover a little bit better. But that also could be simply due to the fact that they're not able to use as heavy of loads to induce hypertrophy. So I kind of have this theory that while as a percentage of your one rep max, you can program things, I think absolute load matters. When you look at the most elite power lifters, the super heavy weights aren't squatting three or four times a week because they're squatting 800, 900 pounds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They need to recover. LAYNE NORTON: I think that there's an overall recovery effect there. Again, I have no data to back this up. This is just my observation. But when you get into the lighter weight classes-- and this goes for men, too-- you do see quite a few people who do many training sessions at high RPEs and seem to be able to recover from that. So I do think the absolute load makes a difference. Now, when it comes to menstrual cycle, this is one of those things where I kind of tell people, do what you prefer. So there are some people who have said, you should schedule your training around your menstrual cycle, which is whenever you're going through your menstrual cycle, reduce the intensity. Reduce the volume because you're not going to feel as good. You're not going to train as well. What I would say is just autoregulate that. If you go in and you're on your period but you feel good and you're doing well that day, then I don't think you necessarily need to back it off. And there was one study that kind of supported that notion. But if you go in and you feel terrible and you feel like you could use a reduction in intensity and volume, then it's totally fine to autoregulate that. And when I say autoregulation, autoregulation means you are regulating the individual training session based on your performance. So I autoregulate insofar as, I'm a super nerd. So I have a velocity device. So I can actually attach it to the bar and see how fast the load moves. And I know at various different warm-up weights what velocities I should be hitting. So if I hit my last warm-up and my velocity is about 10% higher than usual, I can be pretty confident that that's going to be a good day for me. If it's lower, than I can back it off a little bit. In fact, at Worlds, when I hit my last deadlift warm-up, it was 30% faster than I usually hit in the gym. And I turned and looked at my coach and I said, yeah, we're going to get this today. [CHUCKLES] So there's various forms of ways to autoregulate. But again, women, if you're on your period but you feel good, I don't think there's any reason you need to back off. But if you're not feeling good, then it's totally appropriate to back off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Raw versus cooked foods. People wanted to know whether or not, for instance, eating a raw apple versus-- I don't know. Does anyone cook apples? People used to bake-- baked apples was a dessert when I was a kid. It was kind of the letdown dessert. Sorry, Mom. That was not awesome unless it had a scoop of ice cream in it. LAYNE NORTON: Or apple pie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And even then, maybe not awesome. But anyway, raw versus cooked. Obviously, if you burn a piece of meat to the point where it's pure charcoal, that's too much. And there is a small movement surrounding eating raw meats. That's not something I particularly enjoy. Frankly, sushi is the only raw food I personally ingest. LAYNE NORTON: Same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I am very careful about the source, frankly-- reputable places. Is there anything real about this in terms of being able to extract the amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from the food raw versus cooked? LAYNE NORTON: It just looks cool for Instagram. So when you cook foods, they actually tend to become-- in terms of protein-containing foods, they tend to become more digestible, not less. Eggs are this way. Meats are this way. People say, well, when you heat protein, you denature it. And I think they hear that word "denature," and they think destroy. And that is not what denature means. So proteins fold up into 3D dimensional structures, you know this of course, based on their amino acid sequence. And there are specific energies of those amino acids. When you heat protein or add acid, it starts to unfold that protein structure. That happens during digestion anyway. So I always chuckle when-- I've seen some companies come out with "way that you can cook with" that's not going to destroy the amino acids. And I'm like, so you mean regular way, right? So yeah, typically, cooking actually makes amino acids more bioavailable, not less. Now, I would stay away from charring your meat because there is some evidence that charring creates polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which at least in animals, when they give those, they appear to be carcinogenic. So if you do char your meat by accident, I would just cut off the charred portions. And then you should be fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The char is delicious. LAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not if it's charred too much. But there is something about a charred crust on a meat. My dad's Argentine and likes a good charred barbecue. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about-- people referred to them in their questions as "carb blockers." But I think what they're referring to are things like berberine and some of the glucose scavengers. And one glucose scavenger I'd love for you to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk after a meal, or maybe even a slow walk after a meal, some movement can help downshift the amount of circulating glucose in some way. I've heard that. Not a lot of people, but some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things like berberine or even metformin can scavenge glucose. I personally can't take berberine. If I take it, I get massive headaches unless I've ingested tons of sugar and carbohydrates. So I just don't mess around with it. But I know there are a number of people out there that want to know whether or not these glucose scavengers can be useful. LAYNE NORTON: I think that is really majoring in the minors, if I'm being honest. As far as the carb blockers, there's some white kidney bean extract and those sorts of things. They do block the digestion of carbohydrates, some. So when I say "block," those watching or listening, metabolism is typically not on and off switches. So when we say things like "block" or "attenuate" or "inhibit," typically we're not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it, and everything turns off. We're talking about a dimmer switch, OK? So it just changes the emphasis. But these carb blockers can reduce the absorption of carbohydrate. Now, they don't seem to cause weight loss when you just do it in a normal diet. Now, why is that? Well, all it does is once those carbohydrates get to the large intestine and your bacteria get a hold of them, they start fermenting them to volatile fatty acids, which get reabsorbed into your liver. So you don't get the increase in blood glucose. But you still get almost all the calories from it. It's just in a different form. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. LAYNE NORTON: So carb blockers, if they actually worked really well, I mean, if you block something from being absorbed, your GI typically does not just let undigested material sit in there. You get diarrhea. I mean, that would be the outcome. It's also how I debunked the whole 30 grams of protein at a meal, you can't absorb any more than that. I'm like, if that was the case, when you ate a steak, you would just start having diarrhea every time you went over that 30-gram threshold, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember during college-- so this would be early '90s-- there was the Olestra craze. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This idea of putting in a nondigestible thing into things like potato chips so that it would clear through the GI tract faster, not absorb as many calories. This went nowhere, obviously. You don't hear about this anymore. But it does raise an interesting question related to energy balance, which is gastric emptying time. And obviously, in the landscape of eating disorders, in particular anorexia. Use and abuse of laxatives is a way in which people will, in an unhealthy way, try and control their weight. And there's a lot of problems with that approach. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what about gastric emptying time? Is this one way that people could control their energy balance in a healthy way? And where does fiber come into play? LAYNE NORTON: Fiber tends to improve GI transit time because it adds bulk. So your GI system is basically a tube. And it has peristalsis, which is wavelike contractions that moves the food down through the tube. Well, if you have more bulk to the food, like with fiber, you can move it through a little bit better. Now, in the gastric, the stomach specifically, fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit, probably because it congeals a little bit. Now, this gets into the glycemic index argument, right? If you do low GI foods, you'll have a slower release of glucose. It's a slower gastric emptying time. Does that affect energy balance? And so there are quite a few studies looking at low GI versus high GI foods. In the studies where they don't control calories, low GI tends to outperform high GI. But when they control calories, there's no difference. And so what I think that suggests is low GI foods, just by their nature, tend to be higher in fiber. And so I think it just kind of comes back to the fiber issue. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. I'd like to ask you about supplements for a moment. It's an enormous landscape. But I believe there are a few things that you believe in, meaning they exist. And there are decent data to support their use. Maybe even some anecdotal data based on your own experience, as long as we highlight it as such, it could be interesting. I've heard you talk about two in particular, one that I'm very familiar with, which is creatine monohydrate. If you could share your thoughts on that, not just for muscle building but maybe any other purposes for it. And then the other one is one that frankly I'm learning more about all the time now, thanks to your prompt, which is Rhodiola rosea-- I think I pronounced that correctly-- and why that might be interesting or of use to people. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, so touching on creatine, it is the most tested, safe, and effective support supplement we have. I mean, there are thousands of studies on creatine monohydrate now. And I would say very clearly, too, if you're using any other form of creatine, I think you're wasting your money. Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it. Apparently, it's a little more soluble. The claim is that you need less. But there's only a couple of studies on it. And it's more expensive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive. I realize people have different budgets. But it's not a budget breaker. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, it's gotten more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues. There's forms of creatine that appear to be as good, like hydrochloride. But it's more expensive. And then things like creatine ethyl ester has been shown to be worse than creatine monohydrate. Buffered creatine is as good or worse. And it's much more expensive. So I tell people, just take creatine monohydrate. It is tried and true. It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatine. And that's what you want. So creatine works through a few different methodologies. One, through increasing phosphocreatine content, which helps improve exercise performance. It also appears to improve recovery. And it increases lean mass, a lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells. But I mean, muscle cells are mostly water. So when people say, well, it's just water, that's what muscle cells mostly are. And it also increases strength and some other metrics. Now, it also has been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage. Now, that's probably because they're getting an increase in lean mass. And so the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage. But there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass, as well. I don't think that creatine is a fat burner. I think that people are able to train harder, build more lean tissue. And so that's probably having an effect on fat mass. Then they've actually shown more recently some cognitive benefits to creatine, which I find really interesting, as well. But the only knock on creatine that anybody's been able to come up with-- because they've debunked the kidney stuff; they've debunked the liver study; there's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney or liver-- is hair loss. So what about hair loss? Because there was one study in 2009 that showed that creatine increased DHT. But they didn't really show an effect on any other sex hormone. So it's kind of strange. Like, you would think if there was an increase in DHT, there would be something else that changes, as well. And it's only one study. And again, didn't directly measure hair loss. It measured DHT, which we know is involved in the loss of the follicle. So what I would say is that I am not convinced. It's only one study. Never been replicated to my knowledge. And it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome. So if you're somebody who's prone to hair loss and you want to avoid creatine because of that, I understand. But for most people, I don't think it's something to worry about. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine, taking it a bunch of times per day and then backing off? Or just taking it consistently at the-- I think 5 grams per day is the typical dose that people take. LAYNE NORTON: So again, no solutions, only trade-offs. You can load it. And you will saturate your phosphocreatine stores faster, usually within a week. If you just take 5 grams per day, it'll take two, three, four weeks. But you will get to the same place. And you're probably going to have a much lower risk of GI issues. Creatine can be a gut irritant. If it is for some folks, I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses, so maybe multiple 1- or 2-gram doses per day. And definitely don't load it if you're somebody who has GI issues from it. As far as Rhodiola rosea, the research is still in its infancy. I was just reading a new systematic review that concluded that we need more high-quality research. But the research that is out there seems to suggest that not only does it reduce physical fatigue. But also reduces the perception of fatigue and may also enhance memory and cognition, as well. And it's referred to as an adaptogen. So I really like it. My anecdotal experience is when I combine that with caffeine, it tends to smooth out the effects of caffeine. It's a more pleasant experience. And there's also some evidence that if you're coming off caffeine, that it can reduce the negative side effects to caffeine withdrawal, which, by the way, I didn't really believe in that until I actually did a cold turkey-- so before a meet, I will cut out caffeine for seven days because you can basically reset your caffeine tolerance in seven days. And two days in, I mean, I'm groggy. I've got the headaches. Usually, I'll get body aches that come up because caffeine is actually a mild analgesic. And yeah, so it was very interesting to see- but I slept like a baby, I'll tell you that. I slept like a baby. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And then you took caffeine prior to your event-- LAYNE NORTON: To the meet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So you really want the maximum punch from it. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's why you do that. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. And like I said, Rhodiola tends to-- it doesn't eliminate those negative effects. But it tends to dampen them a little bit. So I really like it. Again, would like to see more research on it. But there's a lot more stuff coming out. Ashwagandha is another thing that looks pretty promising. Seems to increase testosterone modestly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. LAYNE NORTON: They've shown increases in lean mass. I don't think the increase in testosterone explains the increase in lean mass. It's just not a big enough increase. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could it be the decrease in cortisol? People have talked about-- LAYNE NORTON: It's possible. It does decrease stress hormones. It also has been shown to help with sleep. But I would like to see more research looking at, mechanistically, how it's increasing lean mass before I say conclusively that this is the next creatine. There's more research that needs to come out. And then there's some other things that have an effect. Citrulline malate, there was a new meta analysis that showed that citrulline malate can reduce fatigue and increase, I think, time to fatigue. And it may actually have some small recovery benefits, as well. Different forms of carnitine can actually have recovery benefits. And actually-- interesting-- I think it's carnitine tartrate actually has been shown-- Volek published a study that actually showed that it increased androgen-receptor density in muscle cells. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's interesting. L-carnitine and its other forms are pretty-- I think there's good evidence that they can improve sperm and egg health for people who are looking to conceive. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, there are a surprising number of studies on this in humans. But yeah, androgen-receptor density-- and that's from oral L-carnitine. People are taking capsules, not injecting directly into the muscle, yeah. LAYNE NORTON: And then you've got things obviously like the other most effective supplement out there is probably caffeine. I mean, if you look at the research studies, caffeine produces very consistently improvements in performance. So that's another one. Some people don't like the effect of caffeine. That's OK. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I wouldn't know because I've never come off it. [CHUCKLES] LAYNE NORTON: Exactly, exactly. Well, interestingly, they do show that the effect appears to be consistent, that even if you're a habitual caffeine user, you do still get a benefit every time you take it. But like you said, you're just used to it. So there's those things. Then you've got things like beta alanine, which it's in our preworkout. Probably not super helpful for most people for resistance training. It does seem to have some benefits for high intensity. If you get out more than 45 seconds or 60 seconds of really hard training, it does appear to help with delaying fatigue for that. And then you've got things like betaine, or also called trimethylglycine, which there's some evidence it can improve lean mass. There's some evidence that it can improve power output. So there's a few things out there. But most of the stuff is not very good. So I think that those kinds of supplements, very useful. But again, I would never tell people they need supplements. Again, even something like creatine is going to be a very small effect compared to proper nutrition, recovery, and hard training. One of the things-- I was talking with Ben Bruno the other day. And I said, you know, some people will ask me like, how does this person make progress? Because their programming is not evidence-based? Or this guy, his exercises are dumb. And I'll say, yeah, but they trained really hard for 20 years. One commonality you see between really successful athletes or bodybuilders is they train really hard. And one of the things I have observed is the more into the weeds people tend to get-- and again, this is just my own anecdote and observation-- the more in the weeds they tend to get, the less hard I see them train. And so one of the things I really like that Mike Israetel said, who's got a PhD and is a bodybuilder himself, he said, you can't outscience hard training, that if you're looking to build muscle and you're looking to improve your body composition, the main thing is just doing the work over time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Consistency and the hard work. And I would add to that-- and this is true of academic endeavors, too, of course; I hope you'll agree-- LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is that, yeah, the other thing is, given the mental side-- earlier we were talking about how satiety signals in the brain and what you think about foods can be relevant. Learning to really enjoy training hard in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well, not just for the effects that it has on body composition-- those, too, of course. But just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard and a really hard workout or a really hard paper that you have to sort through or really digging through a book that's challenging, learning to really enjoy that, I think, if there is a power tool out there, it's the psychological end. LAYNE NORTON: And I think a lot of that is getting the confidence of doing something hard, that there's a payoff at the end. I get asked a lot in my Q&As, how do I get more confident? How do I become more confident? And I'll tell people, you have to do. There's no hack. You can't read about it. You've got to get in the arena. And I don't mean like compete in sports necessarily, but doing a PhD or doing something, just something hard, where you're putting yourself out there. And you're saying, this is my goal. And I'm going to go for it. You just learn so much by doing that about yourself. And so just what you said, I will reframe things in my mind when bad things happen from-- it's not to say I never get stressed out, because I do. And it's not to say that I never get down, because I do, because I'm a human. But when something bad happens-- I actually posted about this in my story today. When something bad happens, very rarely anymore do I go, woe is me. Why did this happen to me? Because you're in the universe. Random bad things are going to happen. So instead, I say-- if I'm not dead-- instead, I say, well, what an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle. And I bet, because in the experience of my life, the biggest lessons and the best things in my life have actually come out of the most challenging, worst things that have happened. And so again, I would never have been able to do these sorts of things if I hadn't taken up weightlifting, because weightlifting taught me so much about perseverance, delayed gratification, overcoming obstacles. And that's why I love it even to this day. And I'll still get butterflies when I go in for a squat session, even though I've been doing it for 23 years. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's wonderful. Well, it's clear that you embrace hard things. And for people listening to this, obviously it doesn't have to be weightlifting-- picking hard things, learning an instrument, learning a language. Challenge is an absolute builder. LAYNE NORTON: And they've actually shown those sorts of things, when you challenge yourself and also mentally, I think there was a new study that came out basically showing a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's and other age-related cognitive decline. I mean, basically, use it or lose it, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, the desire and the will to persevere no doubt translates to this thing that we call the will to live, right? It's related to the will to live. Well, I think that what you just said beautifully embodies what most people are aspiring to, which is to-- I think most people actually want to do hard things. They don't just want to have the results. I think that most people deep down have some understanding that their reward system works that way. I must say, this conversation for me has been tremendously rewarding. First of all, it allowed me to meet you in person for the first time, which I've really enjoyed. Certainly, this won't be our last interaction on this podcast and elsewhere. Also, the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you is astonishing. And-- LAYNE NORTON: There's a lot of stuff rattling around up there. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we all benefit because your ability to pull from the mechanistic side, again I think not limited to but related to your background in biochemistry, all the way through to the impact in humans, animal studies, being able to understand where those sit relative to one another. And then you're obviously a practitioner. You practice what you preach. And what you talk about pertains to men, to women, younger people, older people, people who are vegan, Keto, carnivore. You really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas while staying really nuanced and data driven. And so I just want to say for myself and on behalf of the listeners, really appreciate you coming in here today and sharing with us your knowledge. We will absolutely point people in the direction of where they can learn more about you. And one of the places that I definitely want to mention before we part, however, is this Carbon app. And I should just mention this isn't a paid promotion or anything of that sort. Actually, one of our podcast team members has been using Carbon for a long time. This is an app that you devised which allows people to navigate the exercise, nutrition, and energy balance space for weight loss, muscle gain, fat loss, weight maintenance. I would just like to briefly ask you about that before we conclude. Without necessarily telling us everything that's in the Carbon app, I'd love to know, what are the major things that it does and is good for? And then, what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure were in there when you built it? What's the logical backbone behind it? Because I think there are a lot of food counting, calorie counting, exercise apps out there. Everyone I've talked to that uses Carbon, including our mutual friend, Saagar Enjeti, this member of my podcast, et cetera, raves about it. So what is Carbon? And what does it do? And what was your mindset in building it? What did you really want to see there that you didn't see elsewhere? LAYNE NORTON: So those listening may not know, but I started online coaching people for nutrition back in 2005. And that was the vast majority of my business all the way up until 2017. And I had a lot of success with that, whether it be just average folks looking to lose weight or build muscle and right up to elite level competitors in physique sport. So I had this idea, like-- I don't want to say I had the idea. A few people had the idea. What if we could take what I do in coaching and try to automate as much of that as possible? Because by the time I was becoming a really popular coach, I mean, I was expensive. You were looking at me charging-- I got to the point where I was charging about $1,000 a month for coaching. And most people cannot afford that. And I would like to not just coach rich people. [CHUCKLES] You know what I mean? I would like to be able to help other people. So the idea was to create an app that could do some of this stuff. Now, there's always a place for human interaction. But for people who can't afford that, our app is basically $10 a month. And basically, what we wanted to do was set up an app where-- think about if you went to a nutrition coach. What would they do? They would probably ask you some questions about your goals, take some anthropometrics, maybe dietary preference. And they'd use that information to kind of formulate a baseline plan. That's what Carbon does. So I think there's eight questions in the signup flow about your activity, your exercise, your lifestyle, your body weight, your body fat percentage. And if you don't know it, we help you calculate it. It's not perfect. But it's better than nothing. And then your dietary preferences. And we use that to come up with your baseline. And your baseline will be your calories, your protein, your carbohydrates, and fats. And what's different about our app-- because apps like MyFitnessPal or whatever will do that, as well. What's different about ours is we encourage people to log their weight daily for the reasons that we talked about earlier. And then you can also track your food in the app. And honestly, I think our food tracker is actually way easier to use than most of them out there. What we typically get great rave reviews about is how user-friendly our interface is, that it makes intuitive sense. And so you track your food, try to hit these macros that you're prescribed. And each week, you will be prompted to check in with a coach on your check-in day. And then you put in some information. And then based on how you're progressing, the app will adjust or not adjust based on how you're progressing. So for example, if you're hitting a weight-loss plateau, it will sense that. And it will reduce your calories. Or if you're trying to gain weight and you've hit a plateau, it'll increase your calories. And there's a lot of back-end algorithm stuff that takes care of this. But the fundamental crux of the app is we try to determine your total daily energy expenditure because that's going to tell us the first big thing we need to know, which is, how many calories do you need to be eating for your goal, right? So on the front end, we basically do our best guess based on your anthropometrics. It's not going to be perfect. But it'll get us in the ballpark. And if you do know, like some people already know, well, I know what I maintain my body weight on, there's actually a spot where you can manually enter that during the signup flow. So that's helpful for people who are super nerds like me. But then people will ask, well, do you take Apple Watch data? Do you take this? Do you take that? And no, for the reasons we talked about, that it overestimates energy expenditure. What our app does is it's an algebra equation. If you-- because your body weight, your maintenance calories is your total daily energy expenditure. Your average calories that you eat to maintain your body weight will be the same as your total daily energy expenditure. So if we know how body weight is changing and we know how many calories the person is consuming, we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is. And you can see in the app that we'll-- there's a maintenance calorie tracker, or energy expenditure tracker. And typically, after about three to four weeks, even if the app was off at first, it will have you pretty darn close because, let's say somebody comes on. And their goal is to lose a pound and a half a week or something like that. And the first week, they lose 3 pounds. Now, the app actually accounts for the fact that you can lose more water weight the first week. So they probably wouldn't get an adjustment. But let's say the next week, they lose 3 pounds. The app will sense that and adjust their calories up because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures are actually higher than what it previously estimated based on the amount of weight they're losing. And the same thing goes in reverse. If they're not losing the amount of weight that they're supposed to, it will lower them based on the fact that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure. But that's the first crux of it, is tracking that energy expenditure. And then the next thing is protein. So when the back-end algorithm stuff is happening, calories are set first based on your energy expenditure and your goal. So for example, if you're on an aggressive diet, your calories are going to be lower even if your energy expenditure might be a little bit high, just because if you're trying to lose 2 pounds a week, I mean, you're going to be in a pretty aggressive calorie deficit. So it's going to set the calories first. Then, it will set protein based on your lean body mass. Then, the calories that are left over will be allotted to carbohydrate and fat depending on your dietary preference. And we have a few different dietary preferences. There's balanced, which is about 50/50 to 60/40 carbohydrate to fat of the remaining calories. Then you have low fat, which is obviously a higher ratio of carbohydrates. You have low carb. You have a ketogenic diet, which is very, very low carb. And then there's also a plant-based option. And within each of those options, still, you can go in and actually shimmy the macros a little bit within a certain range so that you can kind of dial in what your specific dietary preference is because, again, if we go back to what is going to produce the best long-term results, it's whatever the person can adhere to. So we really try to start with the concept of adherence by allowing people to have the dietary preference that they want. And there's some other apps out there that are good apps. For example, we get asked a lot, what's the difference between our app and the Renaissance Periodization app? And they have a great app. But theirs is kind of more rigid. And it'll say, you're going to eat this many meals. And you're going to have these foods at these times. So we're kind of the opposite. We want to give you maximum flexibility. Now, for some people, they would prefer the rigid structure at first. But we find that for most people, giving them more flexibility typically improves adherence over the long run. So that's kind of how the app works. And again, there's multiple different goals. It's not just a weight-loss app. There's a maintenance. There's muscle-building. So you've got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated, different rates of each of those goals. And I mean, I've used the app for over three years now to do my body weight. And I mean, when I say that it's dialed me in-- because I'm very regimented with logging and logging my weight. So what I targeted to weigh in at Worlds, I got down to the 0.1 kilogram. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's fantastic. LAYNE NORTON: So it was pretty cool to be able to use a tool that I helped develop to actually coach me. So it's a great tool. We did some statistics. We polled 2,500 members. And one of the questions we asked is, would you recommend this to a friend? And 91% said yes. So I think our average retention is, like, seven months, which for an app that costs $10 a month is really great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's great. Yeah, as I mentioned, a number of people I know use it. This is not a paid promotion. But I think people need guidance and tools. And what we know about the human brain is that winging it can work, but that the brain will cheat itself often. There's a Feynman quote about this. And I'll get it wrong. It's always bad to try and quote Feynman anyway because he said it so much better. But that we are the easiest-- it's easy to fool ourselves basically, is what he was saying-- easiest to fool ourselves. LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds great. We will put a link to it so that people can check it out. Again, it sounds like a wonderful tool and a tool that nets a lot of the principles that sit as major themes for weight loss, weight gain. I would assume directed lean tissue gain is what most people are after, and weight maintenance because a number of people would like to just maintain. Listen, I really appreciate your time and all that you're doing, certainly, your time and energy and knowledge today but also what you're doing on the various social media channels. And just the fact that somebody from the depths of academia is out there sharing so much knowledge across so many domains, you're a gem in this landscape of nutrition and one that people really need to hear from. So thank you so much for your time. LAYNE NORTON: Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. I really enjoyed it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We'll do it again.
