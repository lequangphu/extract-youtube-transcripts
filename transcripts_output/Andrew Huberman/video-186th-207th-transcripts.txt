Title: Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2023-09-06 12:00:50 UTC
Description:
This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group.

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, and over-thinking, as well as how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate.

This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional.

The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode marks the first in a four episode series all about mental health the expert guest for this series is Dr Paul KY Dr Paul kti is a medical doctor and psychiatrist who completed his medical training at Stanford University School of Medicine and then went on to become chief resident of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School he then went on to found the Pacific Premier Group which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists who are expert in treating all types of psychiatric disorders and life stressors across the four episodes of this series on Mental Health Dr Ki teaches us about the structure of our own minds and how to think about our own minds as a way to enhance our mental health he explains how our subconscious mind and our conscious mind interact to drive our emotions our decision-making and our behavior and while any series about mental health requires that from time to time we discuss personality disorders and psychiatric challenges the main discussion in today's episode and in fact all four episodes in this series are about what it means to be mentally healthy and how to build one's mental health through specific practices either done alone or with a therapist today's episode addresses several key questions as well as provides protocols for you to address questions about your own Mental Health for instance you will learn what constitutes the most mentally healthy version of yourself you will learn to assess and indeed you will learn protocols for addressing levels of anxiety levels of your confidence how to think about your beliefs and internal narratives how to think about your selft talk and restructure your selft talk we discuss common challenges such as overthinking we talk about the role of defense mechanisms and other aspects of the conscious and unconscious mind interactions that can lead us toward or away from the healthiest versions of ourselves you'll notice that during the first 5 minutes or so of today's discussion Dr kti describes a framework of what he refers to as the structure of self and the function of self and he describes several pillars for understanding what those are I'd like to highlight that while that short portion of our discussion does bring up a number of terms that are likely to be novel to you they certainly were novel to me that as our conversation proceeds you will really come to appreciate just how simple and yet powerful that framework is it will help you understand for instance the relationship between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind in ways that you can really apply toward enhancing your mental health in addition to that Dr kti has generously provided a few PDFs which illustrate that framework for you and that are available completely zero cost by going to the links in the show note captions so you have the option to download those PDFs and to look them over either prior to or during or perhaps after you listen to these four podcast episodes as a final note before beginning today's discussion just want to emphasize my sentiment which I'm confident will soon be your sentiment as well which is that Dr Paul kti shares with us immensely powerful tools for enhancing mental health that at least to my knowledge have never been shared publicly before in fact as somebody who has done more than three decades of therapy I've never before been exposed to a conversation about the structure of the mind and the subconscious mind as well as tools and protocols for enhancing mental health as powerful as these for me the information was absolutely transformative in terms of reshaping my thought patterns my emotional patterns and indeed several of my behavioral patterns and I'm confident that the information that you'll glean from today's episode and throughout the series will be positively transformative for you as well before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zeroc cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is betterhelp better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online I personally have been doing weekly therapy for more than 30 years and while that Weekly therapy was initiated not by my own request it was in fact a requirement for me to uh remain in high school over time I really came to appreciate just how valuable doing quality therapy is in fact I look at doing quality therapy much in the same way that I look at going to to the gym or doing cardiovascular training such as running as ways to enhance my physical health I see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health the beauty of better help is that they make it very easy to find an excellent therapist an excellent therapist can be defined as somebody who is going to be very supportive of you in an objective way with whom you have excellent rapport with and who can help you arrive at Key insights that you wouldn't have otherwise been able to find and because better heal therapy is conducted entirely online it's it's extremely convenient and easy to incorporate into the rest of your life so if you're interested in betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month that's betterhelp spelled hp.com today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions mindfulness trainings Yoga Nidra sessions and more by now there's an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up app makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practice in a way that's going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things like Yoga Nidra which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refreshed in fact the science around Yoga Nidra is really impressive showing that after a Yoga Nidra session levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to 60% which places the brain in body into a state of enhanced Readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing I really like about the waking up app is that it provides a 30-day introduction course so for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practice that's fantastic or if you're somebody who's already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations and yoga needer sessions for you as well if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman and access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman and now for my discussion about how to understand and assess your level of mental health with Dr Paul KY Dr Paul kti welcome thank you I'm very excited for today's episode and for this series because I like so many other people out there have a lot of questions about myself and themselves and not just about ourselves but how the different personality types out there the healthy types the narcissists the you know all the things that we hear about these days gaslighting all these sorts of things what all of that really is um perhaps we can dispel some of the myths that exist during the course of this series I'm sure we will or you will thank you and also raise certain important questions that we should all ask ourselves in terms of trying to understand who we are and how we can be the best versions of ourselves how we can experience the most happiness also the the most richness in life because of course life isn't just all about being happy so to start off this question I I want to raise a parallel with something I think for most people is is more concrete which is physical health you know um while there isn't an ideal physical self that's been defined by the medical community we know for instance that there is a range of blood pressures that are considered healthy there's a a range of body mass index that's considered healthy although that's a little controversial because it depends on how much muscle how lean people are Etc but you know I think it's reasonable to say that the healthy individual is not going to get exhausted walking up a flight of stairs that they could bend down and lift an object without hurting themselves they might even have some additional strength or endurance Etc within the physical health domain all of that is fairly well scripted and there are protocols that people can follow to improve their physical health we've covered many of them on this podcast before when it comes to mental health and it comes to concepts of the self Things become much more abstract for people in fact I think most people including myself are kind of wandering around in the dark wondering whether or not we are the best versions of ourselves whether or not we're thinking about ourselves and the world around us in the best best ways so to start things off you tell us what is the healthy version of self I mean what what what should we all be aspiring to you've worked with people who uh presumably are healthy and people who have severe pathologies of different psychiatric types right bipolar narcissistic sociopathic uh and everything in between so for me and for the listeners what is a healthy self what should we be striving for well a healthy self approaches life through the lens of agency and gratitude if you look at happy people you know people who like their lives right no matter what stage of Life they're at right no matter what their socioeconomic status is you know race religion there's so many things that we we think matters right and and and and they matter to a lot of things do they matter to is someone happy or not right they they are not factors right the factors that tell us is this person enjoying life are they going to take care of themselves are they happy they're here are they engaged productively in the world is agency and gratitude and if we have those two things then it's interesting you almost never see someone go wrong right and even if if there difficulties even if there are things happen in life that that can make some unhappiness right it doesn't take away the person's engagement in life the person's enthusiasm for life and I think if you look at even traditions of understanding how are people happy whether it's in Psychiatry or it's through literature or through a religious lens it is always people who approach life through the lens of agency and gratitude could we go a little bit deeper on agency and gratitude sure when I hear the words agency and gratitude I think agency and ability to affect the world around me in the ways that I want and I think gratitude being thankful and uh and we did an entire episode all about gratitude practices some of the neuroscience and neuroimaging and Ne chemical changes that occur in the brain and body when people exert a gratitude practice but I have a feeling that when you talk about agency and gratitude you might be talking about something slightly or maybe even quite a bit different than the way that I'm defining it yeah I would say agency and gratitude are these amazing rewards right that sit on top of the highly complex brain function inside of us and the highly complex psychology in all of us so if we think about a self right that I identify a self right I'm an ie right if if I'm going to approach the world with agency and gratitude that's sitting on top of a lot of healthy things right and the idea that okay there are ways in which we can be mentally unhealthy right but to start with like what is going on inside of us right and what does it look like when we're healthy so there's a structure of the self right there's function of the self and we we look at the structure and the function and the parts the components of structure and function we can come to understand okay what is going on in us what might we change for the better how do we build empowerment right empowerment is is the the the ability to navigate the world around us and to bring myself to bear in ways that are effective and from empowerment arises the sense of agency right I have agency because I am empowered right and also from a healthy structure of self and function of self we end up with humility right we come through that with a sense of our our place in the world and our power in the world to to navigate as we choose but also a sense of the world around us that's far more complicated right than just we are extends Beyond us to other people to the climate around us to the health of the whole planet right we we feel a sense of humility that I'm here and I can do good things I'm fortunate to be here and I'm part of this bigger ecosystem right all the way up to the scale of the ecosystem of earth right and if we feel that humility then we approach the world through the lens of gratitude so the idea that a healthy structure of self and a healthy function of self leads to empowerment and humility and then upon that we are we are sort of imbued with agency and gratitude and that leads us us forth to happy lives okay so it's clear to me why having agency and gratitude would be wonderful perhaps even the goal state that we should all be seeking to achieve and it also makes sense to me as to why empowerment and humility are important components that feed into our ability to have agency and gratitude yes right because all of that at least to my mind sums to it a very clear statement about having agency and gratitude is the best way to approach life that all makes perfect sense to me and yet I've never really thought about it that way and I think most people haven't ever been told this right I mean what should we be seeking agency and gratitude yes you know we've heard endless number of podcasts including this podcast about physical health and we've been told by physicians and everybody else that you know we should seek to have a relatively low blood pressure we should seek to have a relatively low heart rate that cholesterol should be at a certain level Etc So within the physical health domain you know there are strong clear messages about what we should all be striving toward and in a similar way to how we're discussing the self in Psychology you know I don't think anyone seeks to have low blood pressure or low heart rate because that's what they want per se they want those things along with some capacity for endurance the ability to to you know lift an object so some strength Etc because of the way that those metrics of Health allow them to move through the world in the best possible way in other words having some degree of endurance allows you to walk down the block maybe a lot further or to walk up several flights of stairs or to have some strength allows you to pick up objects and effectively move through life right you're telling us that having a sense of agency and gratitude and that agency and gratitude are underg guarded by empowerment and humility and that's the best way to move through life the most effective happiest if you will way to move through life well then I think we have to ask ourselves the same thing we would ask about physical fitness which is what goes into creating a sense of agency and gratitude empowerment and humility you know what are the action steps because if I want more endurance I know to get on an exercise bike or or a treadmill or go out for a run a few times a week or more if I want to get stronger I'm going to lift objects that are difficult to lift until they're easier to lift I mean it's all pretty straightforward in the physical domain but in the in the mental health domain in the psychological domain it does become a bit more abstract I think in part because no one's ever told us certainly no one's ever told me what you really need in is agency and gratitude in order to have the best possible life so I very much appreciate that you're telling us this and I'd love for you to tell us what are the action steps that go into creating these things that we're calling agency gratitude empowerment and humility you there's actually quite a strong parallel between the physical health Dimension and the mental health Dimension so so as you're saying like why do you put in the time the energy the learning right to be physically healthy right it's a lot of effort and and we put so much of ourselves towards it if we decide that we value that right why do we do it right because as you said it's the best way to approach life like there may be something that I want to do I I want to run a race right or I you know I I want to climb a mountain right but ultimately we take care of ourselves physically because we don't know what's coming next in life and we want to be prepared for it good bad and otherwise right and the same thing is true of mental health so I can feel grateful for something I can feel grateful that I'm still breathing right now right I can exercise agency I can pick up that cup and take a drink right but that doesn't mean that I'm living life through the lens of agency and gratitude which is consistent with every opinion if you look psychologically through the lens of literature through the lens of so of sociology and psychology agency and gratitude make happiness right they ways of approaching life and just like physical health is undergirded by uh by cardiovascular health heart health muscle strength right that there's an undering of agency and gratitude and empowerment and humility are ways of describing okay what arises right from understanding ourselves taking care of ourselves that then gives us the agency and gratitude so we have empowerment we have humility but where does it all come from right so just like we have to understand the physical body and what to do to it in order to be healthy right we also have to understand the mind right the self that wants to be healthier and that comes through understanding the structure of the self and we have enough science through the lens of neurobiology and Psychiatry to understand the structure of self and then the function of self right how we work right how we interfere face with the world so it's actually not more complicated than physical health it's just that we don't spell it out that way right we come at it through the lens of pathology of what's wrong and who has some diagnosis and you know we're looking for the problematic instead of saying like what do we look like when we're happy right and then going and digging down into the mechanics of it all right and if we're not in that state right to go and look at that and to make changes just as if you were very very physically healthy right but you know your heart rate couldn't go up that much without you feeling very very fatigued we'd say well look you're doing a lot of the right things right but let's work more on on your heart right we would go look at the specifics of it because that's how we understand it and we just don't apply the same science logic common sense to mental health as we do to physical health but it's time for that to change because we have the knowledge and ability to do just that when we had Dr Andy Galpin on this podcast to do a series on physical health and uh Fitness essentially he said something that really stuck with me which was that the number of different workouts that people can do out there body weight workouts work with weights with machines you can run far you can run shorter distances more quickly you know you can do planks you know situps so many variations on exercise routines but what he very clearly stated was that there are only a few core adaptations that the body can undergo that lead to these byproducts that we call lower blood pressure enhanced endurance improved strength improved uh neuromuscular function improved brain function for that matter it sounds to me like there are a lot of parallels in creating the healthy psychological self so what are the core components that I and others should think about in terms of understanding I think he described them as the structure of the self and the functions of the self again just to draw a parallel if we were talking about physical health we'd say okay there's connections between nerves and muscle that allows us to move our limbs if you apply a certain amount of resistance you get a certain adaptation which is the the neuromuscular connection get stronger the muscle might get bigger or just stronger Etc flexibility you know you just push your range of motion just a little bit into discomfort you do that we it so happens to be the case that you do that for just a couple of minutes each day over the course of about a week or so you get a significant increase in flexibility okay so it's all very clear in the physical domain in the psychological domain I hear you telling us that the action steps that we all should be taking in order to be the happiest version of ourselves by achieving agency and gratitude is to explore the structure of self and the function of self so if you could tell us about what is the structure of self like what goes into Andrew being Andrew and Paul being Paul and whoever The Listener is into being who they are what is that and what is the function of self how how does a Psy Christ think about that how should we think about that okay if I could start maybe to set the stage for that right by pointing out that as we go up the hierarchy right of Health right everything should get simpler right not more complicated right if you think about physical health right there's so much complexity on the initial levels right so we think about you know your physical health status versus mine right it's going to be different right we're going to have different cardiac function and muscle function and pulmonary function and if we're going to be healthy we could do a lot of different things right there might be a whole set of choices that would work well for you different choices that would work for me and we can gauge intensity timing frequency right it's very complicated when we're on the the lower levels of the hierarchy as we get higher up let's say you and I both do the right things right then what happens we both have endurance right we both have some strength we're both robust right things are getting simpler because we're we're we're approaching the unique idiosyncrasies in all of us right and we have to look at that and look at that in a very specific way but what we're trying to get to is is something that's common for all of us so stamina for example in physical health and endurance right and agency and gratitude in mental health right so then if we go and we look and we look at the structure of the self and the function of self we find that there's more complexity but that it is also understandable I mean there's tremendous complexity in the body just as there's tremendous complexity in the mind and we can understand what is the structure of self what is the function of self and we can look at that and assess that in the same way we would physical health parameters so that we arrive at the place we want to be be it endurance or agency or gratitude so structure of self right we all have an unconscious mind right and we pay so little attention to this part of us that really is the biological supercomputer right so millions of things are going on all the time like in every Split Second so for example I can say these words right you can listen to the words you can say things back and I can listen right they're millions and millions of things going on under the surface much of which comes from either biological predispositions right or habits over time right thought processes patterns right so this unconscious mind this supercomputer is doing all of these things like you know at the speed of light right there are electrical and chemical signals and you know multiple Pathways as common as complicated as super highway systems that then get Consolidated and communicate with others right and then what comes up from all of that is the conscious mind so imagine an iceberg right and it's a really really big Iceberg right and and we see the part above the surface right that's the conscious mind right but there's a huge part of this Iceberg maybe 95% of it that's underneath the water right that there's this hulking mass that we don't see that's the unconscious mind right and it's feeding up to the conscious mind which is a much smaller part of our brain function right but it's the part that we're aware of right it's sitting on top of all the unconscious things which are extremely important but then we become aware so that we can engage in the real world in order for us to have this conversation the millions of things per second have to be going on underneath the surface so that you and I as conscious eyes right as conscious selves Can Ride Along on top of it so that's the part of the iceberg that's above the water it's the conscious self then imagine that the conscious self is girded by by uh a a set of um you know long uh tendrils that come out from under the w water right that there are defense mechanisms that are unconscious to us that sort of GD the conscious mind so do we rationalize automatically do we avoid automatically do we act out automatically are these things in Us in ways that we can observe and change but that are there to try and protect the conscious mind from the the slings and arrows of the world around us right so if you imagine there's the big part of the iceberg under the water the unconscious mind the conscious mind is riding on top of it but the conscious mind that part sticking out of the water is vulnerable right so imagine that there's a defensive structure then that arises from the part of the iceberg that's underwater that is there to defend and protect the conscious mind so when you say to defend and protect when you say that the conscious mind is vulnerable what do you mean do you mean that it's vulnerable to physical attack or that it's vulnerable to us realizing that we're just a neurons that are clicking away underneath like in other words where does the vulnerability of the conscious mind really reside um not physically where does it reside but you know what am I so worried about in terms of my safety I mean right now we're in a room I feel pretty safe um I don't think you're going to attack me verbally or physically I suppose it's possible that could happen but it seems like a very distant possibility So when you say that these defenses are there to protect us from some sort of awareness what awareness are we trying to avoid so the the vulnerability of the of the conscious mind is to fear confusion despair right there's so many things that that we can fear right some people are afraid of snakes or spiders some people are afraid of death some people are afraid of health issues that could come to them or to people they love we can get confused and not know what decisions to make and how to navigate the world and how to be who we want to be to ourselves and to others right we can feel tremendously vulnerable and despairing if we lose others or you know we start to see things happening in the world around us that that that we don't like right we start to feel like what will happen to the planet we live on where there'll be War where I live will my children be safe right there's so much that we need to protect ourselves again so that vulnerable part of of us right the part of the iceberg sticking out above the water needs a defensive structure around it to protect it against the vulnerability of fear confusion despair right and because the conscious mind is is sticking out of the water with a defensive structure around it right it is the the raw material from which we create our character structure so the character structure is all of that the part under the water the part above the water the defensive structure so imagine like a nest around all of that and that's the character structure that we utilize to interface with the world right so the character structure is it's like the thing that I'm using right it's like if you're driving somewhere in a car right the car is the thing that you're using to go there right the character structure is the thing that we're using to interface with the world so for example how trusting am I versus suspicious right how readily do I come to make friends with people right how uh how much do I act out if I'm frustrated right how much do I um you know exclaim something negative right as opposed to holding it inside of me how much do I rationalize if something isn't going well do I want to look at it and maybe see that it is so that I don't have to face it right how much do I avoid problems in the world around me how much do I exercise altruism right these are all the ways in which we're engaging with the world around us and this determines the self imagine that the self then grows out of this Nest from the the character structure that we use to interface with the world and the decisions that we make so if our character structure is it's the thing through which we engage with the world then we're enacting right what is inside of us right what we've determined through our unconscious mind our conscious mind our defense mechanism there's a certain us that that comes at the world in a certain way and if we're more or less trusting more or less avoidant we rationalize more or less these are the factors that determine like where do where do our lives go right because on top of all of this imagine that the nest of the character structure around all of this grows from it the self right the product of the feelings inside the things that we know about ourselves and don't know about ourselves the decisions that all of it leads to so I may choose to be for example more trusting and that may bring an opportunity to me that I wouldn't have otherwise had right I may choose to be more trusting and it may bring risk to me that I wouldn't otherwise have had so we want to be as healthy as we can as knowledgeable of ourselves and the world around us so that it's safe for us to have a healthy character structure through which we can engage in the world around us with a sense of prudence right taking reasonable risks right not too little so that we shut ourselves down and maybe end up despairing not so much that that scary things can happen to us and we end up fearful right but the idea that if we know ourselves well the character structure is healthy right because it's built upon a structure of self and a function of self that are healthy and out of it is coming empowerment right and empowerment and humility right that then lead us to agency and gratitude right the idea here is that this is the character structure that we create that can then interface with the world in a way that's good for us and good for the world around us that leads us to be able to live in much more Harmony inside of ourselves and outside of ourselves so if I understand correctly defense mechanisms that grow up out of this portion of the iceberg that we're calling the unconscious mind they protect our conscious self in ways that can be adaptive or that can be maladaptive in other words defenses can be healthier they can be unhealthy yes and perhaps in a in a few minutes we can get into what a healthy versus an unhealthy defense looks like but the way you describe character structure sounds to me like an array of contextual dispositions I don't want to add unnecessarily um complex language but it sounds to me like a bunch of dispositions like like if I'm walking into the office where I know everybody and I see familiar faces there's no reason for me to be on guard if I trust those people but if I'm walking down a a street at night that I'm not familiar with and and I'm starting to get the sense that you know this neighborhood might not be the best it makes sense for me to be on relatively high alert so different dis positions depending on different conditions I can't help but mention my uh Bulldog Costello who had basically three dispositions it was asleep but in all seriousness the second one was um kind of bored the Bulldog face is kind of bored or if something was given to him that he liked or if we were doing something he liked Delight he Bas had three dispositions as far as I could tell um I think one of the reasons we like dogs so much or that many of us like dogs so much is that their decisions are very predictable take him to the park he's happy unless he happened to be ill that day which was rare um you know feed him he's happy right there wasn't a lot of uh I don't like this particular meal or I don't like this particular park or this Bean fris doesn't smell so good to me you know there's a it was so simple and and yet people are very complex right I I I can look at myself and say okay what like what is my character structure character structur is certain things I like certain things I dislike certain things really irritate me certain environments and people I just lighten okay so is the definition of a healthy character structure one in which the dispositions match the context perfectly I mean I don't know how any of us could be like that but is is that sort of the ideal much in the same way that um you know we could probably arrive at at an ideal degree of stamina that one could have I mean some people want run ultramarathons you know 100 miles or more some people want to run a marathon some people like me don't really desire to run a marathon but I want to be able to run a mile if I need to without being completely exhausted and injured so you know when we when we ask ourselves about character structure are we asking ourselves about context driven dispositions and you know how do we start to evaluate that for ourselves right I think because we're more complicated I think it's not dispositions as much as it's predispositions right so so in the example that you gave right you have a certain predisposition to be either trusting or wary right and and you're and that's healthy in you right so when you come into a setting where there's not a a good reason to feel mistrustful to feel anxious to feel vulnerable right then you feel at ease right so you walk into the work setting there are people you know there're people you like everything is okay right you have a different pre predisposition when the context is different right so if the context could bring a lack of safety then you respond accordingly with a lack of safety right but but it's possible certainly those predispositions can be in unhealthy places right so for example you might have been traumatized in a certain way or you might approach the world in a certain way because of Prior experience that you may not register as trauma but it may be that within you is a predisposition to be mistrustful so you could walk into a room of people that you know of people who've never met you any harm and still feel unsafe right now this happens most often after trauma but there are other ways people can get to that where the predisposition isn't so healthy the converse is true too right there are people who can have too much of what's called an omnipotence defense and then they don't recognize danger when danger is around them so the idea the character structure that Nest right that's built around the defensive structure and the conscious mind that's sitting on top of the part of the iceberg the unconscious mind underwater right it's that Nest that is interfacing with the world through a whole whole set of predispositions I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 so I'm delighted that they sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking ag1 and the reason I still take ag1 once or generally twice per day is that it's the easiest way for me to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins minerals probiotics and fiber that I need in my diet now of course it's essential to get proper nutrition from Whole Foods but most people including myself find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day and especially to get enough prebiotics and probiotics to ensure gut health as you may know your gut contains trillions of little microbiota the so-called gut microbiome which establishes critical connections with other organs of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support your immune system and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health one of the most common questions I get is if if you were to take Just One supplement which supplement would that be and my answer is always ag1 because by taking ag1 I'm able to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins minerals and probiotics that I need to enhance my mental health physical health and performance if you'd like to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim this special offer I think most of us are familiar with assessing and assigning names to the character structures of others and at least for most of us we do that with no professional training or authority right we say that person is great they're super nice person's a jerk they're like weird you know etc etc I think very few of us are familiar with assessing our own character structure right right and I have to presume that some of what happens when somebody comes to you as a psychiatrist or to a psychologist is that certain questions are asked and certain narratives are told that start to reveal to the clinician the character structure and perhaps from there some of the possible defense mechanisms and uh you know structure of the person's unconscious mind and conscious mind that obviously are unaware to them but would be clear to the clinician much in the same way that if somebody goes into the doctor and says you know I don't feel well they're going to start probing with questions or they're going to put you know take a take a listen to their breathing listen to their heart right I me get out the stethoscope and figure it out these are the probes whereas that the psychiatrist or psychologist uses words and language to probe yes so what are the sorts of aspects of character structure that we can be aware of in ourselves you know I in other words um should we be asking what type of character do I have dependent on one circumstance or another um should we ask ourselves what sorts of defenses we have and maybe this would be a good opportunity to um address this issue of what are healthy versus unhealthy defenses um because it sounds to me if I understand correctly that the defense mechanisms are a very strong component in determining what our character structure is right because the defense mechanisms are unconscious right the character structure that Nest around the defenses and the conscious mind through which we interface with the world right is very very complicated so there are as many character structures as there are human beings right so it's very very complicated but there are factors that are consistently relevant across people and get identified as such so so one example would be isolation versus affiliation right so does a person tend to group with others right or does the person tend to avoid grouping right and and go about uh thoughts tasks approaches to life in a in a more singular manner right so it's just one element not making value judg about it cuz it can be good or bad on either end of the spectrum right so we're just saying what are the factors so am I more affiliative or do I tend to isolate and be more singular that's just one example right another example could be things like for example use of humor right uh does a person use humor and in what way right does a person use hum humor to deflect uh discomfort in negative situations does a person use humor in order to belittle others or to belittle themselves or does a person not use humor right so there these aspects of character structure and so much research has been done on this over the years to determine what is most Salient right in this this thing that we use in order to interface with the world around us up out of which grows our self that makes good sense and and it makes me want to revise a little bit what I asked about before which is I said that when it comes to an exam of physical health we measure blood pressure measure um uh breathing Etc maybe even a blood test look at some biomarkers but what you're describing is a little bit more analogous to um The Physician uh addressing a patient who's having some physical discomfort or malaise and saying tell me about your day you know what do you do when you get up in the morning if the person says well you know I I drink a you know a quarter pint of Vodka it's a very different answer then you know I go outside and get sunlight in my eyes drink a glass of water and maybe have a cup of coffee right you know um or if somebody says I have six espresso if I understand correctly the character structure is better revealed by exploring the action states that somebody engages in isolation versus engagement um as opposed to a read of one specific biomarker um it's character structure brought to life right yes immediately am thinking about movies and books where we learn so much about somebody through a observing the way that they interact with people in in very um very potent ways so for instance I can think of countless movies where you learn a ton about somebody in the first scene simply because of the way they react to somebody who you know Cuts them off on in traffic they just explode okay well then we think of that person as reactive from that point on unless there's a significant amount of material to revise that but it's in the action of of of getting explosive and cursing Etc as opposed to if they just kind of like laugh it off or laugh at themselves or blame someone within their own vehicle or something like that so is are those the sorts of things that a clinician like yourself is listening for when somebody says you know I don't feel well and you say well tell me about what's going on lately and they start describing what's going on in their life and are you listening for those places where the def the defense mechanisms can are start start to reveal themselves the character structure starts to reveal itself through these action steps that the person seems to be taking is it yeah yeah I mean maybe one way of looking at at character structure is that it's it's potentialities and predispositions right that there's so much that that's latent that then interfaces with events like a person's stuck in traffic how does that person respond if that person weren't stuck in traffic there wouldn't be a response to it right so so there potentialities there predispositions and then we live through enacting them as we're moving then through life right and the the attempts to understand so using the physical health parallel right if you came in and you said I don't feel well right you know we might run a lot of tests right we might get an MRI or a CAT scan or even putting the stethoscope and listening to what's inside of you those we could say are unconscious things like you know you're not aware of what the Imaging may show or the blood tests may show or how your lungs may sound when someone puts a stethoscope on them right so so a clinician if you're trying to understand and help someone then you do want to look for those things right you want to look for the things that are underneath the surface but that but that can be very very important right you also want to look at everything that's on the surface right so if you're if you're engaging with someone you're engaging with the self right the self that grows out of the character structure Nest right so by engaging with and and doing one's best to understand the self then you learn about what is underneath of it right so I may then learn well how do you respond in certain situations right just like I could ask you questions well when do you not feel well or right so you're asking a person questions because the idea is to understand elements of the character structure so how do you respond in certain situations what's going on inside of you right what do you understand about yourself and what do you not understand about yourself right how do you bring yourself to bear in the world around you so there's a similar process going on but here we're trying to understand the self and the understanding of the self can help us understand the component underneath of the self because that's where we're going to go to make things better right the idea is there shouldn't have to be mystery or certainly not mystery any more than there is in physical health I mean you know rarely someone comes in and they're really not feeling well and and a whole set of everything that should be done is done right Labs physical examination history Imaging right and and you still just don't know right I mean sometimes that can happen but it's very rare and the same should apply here that if we're examining a self right and we're looking for the components out of which that self comes right then we should be able to understand well enough to go back to the components of self and to make change so that the self is in a better place right and and that self can then be empowered can feel humility right can then come at life through the altruism and gratitude that we seek because again you show me someone who's coming at life through altruism and gratitude and is not happy with their life and you'll be showing me something I've never seen before something entirely new so if we want to get there we want to know how to get there and there are ways as there should be that parallel physical health that aren't mysterious that we can come at to make understanding and change I'm wondering about the role of anxiety in all of this the reason I ask about anxiety is that you said said that so much of character structure is uh determined by a set of predispositions and potentialities mhm and earlier we were talking about example of either being afraid or unafraid in particular environments or feeling like we can walk into a classroom and learn or whether or not we're overly concerned about what people think about us or both right it could be a mix um whether or not we can Embrace novel environments in safe and adaptive ways whether or not we can grow from them as opposed to whether or not we can be over taken by them or perhaps even injured harmed psychologically physically or both anxiety to me is is a very basic function I think about it in terms of the autonomic nervous system and degrees of excitability and Etc an ability to sleep at night an ability to wake up feeling reasonably good but not have a panic attack but anxiety to me does seem like a key node in all of this meaning you know I most people including myself I don't walk around thinking about my character structure I don't walk around thinking about how I'm going to behave in a bunch of hypothetical environments think about the fact that most mornings I wake up and I feel pretty good to be quite honest not as good as I would like to feel necessarely because anything's wrong but because I think I'm wired to be a little bit more on the anxious side and to predict what's going to happen next and what needs to be done and so until I'm actually engaging in certain behaviors that anxiety hums a little bit high for me the gears turn a little bit faster perhaps than than I would like when I wake up in the morning but once I engage I feel like the the speed of that gear turning uh matches the demands of Life pretty well I feel um agency okay um so if you don't mind could we explore this this feeling of anxiety or lack of anxiety that I think people are pretty familiar with within themselves at different times of day and under different conditions because to me it seems like a um an interesting lens to to explore this notion of character structure and defenses is anxiety a healthy defense or an unhealthy defense or does it simply depend on the circumstances well we all have some degree of anxiety in us right we all have some awareness that like we're navigating the world and like not everything is is perfect right this is not Nirvana so there's some anxiety within us and the thought is that that anxiety can keep us Vigilant about the things we should be vigilant about you know health and safety right but that too much anxiety then becomes counterproductive and we can look at this in a very regimented way right so so some anxiety makes sense right it keeps us being careful it keeps you keeps you being careful as you're pulling out of a driveway for example right so okay it can be it can be absolutely fine but let's say you bring something to clinical attention that isn't absolutely fine right let's say I didn't know you and you come in we have the example that that we that you used before where where you you walk into work and there's a group of people that you that you know well and like right let's say you told me when I walk in there I I feel very anxious right I don't feel like things are okay right so then we would go through we say that's not good right maybe it's impacting your professional life things are not going well like you really want this to change because it's impacting your life in a negative way and we say okay let's look at that from the perspective of structure of self right so first unconscious right is it that just genetically are you built with just High levels of anxiety right so we could learn okay have you always been anxious like this is this has this always been in your life since you were a little kid no matter what so we're looking for biological nature so to speak variables we might also look for things that have happened to you that are lodged in your unconscious mind right is there trauma that you haven't processed right that now is underneath the surface but is spinning off more anxiety right let's say you tell me oh it it wasn't that long ago you started being anxious ah like did something happen happen like did you walk into a group of people and I don't know you tripped and you felt bad about something right and then then you get more anxious right so are there things going on underneath the surface that are impacting you like let's let's look into that right because that's the biggest part of the iceberg right then your conscious mind we could start thinking about okay what what's going on what are you actively thinking about right so this is where sometimes cognitive behavioral techniques can can come into mind like are you thinking like oh no I'm scared it isn't going to go well right like are you having thoughts or the thoughts and making you more anxious right what's going on in your conscious mind right I would also be very interested in the defenses around you so for example do you tend to avoid right has this been getting worse for three months but but you just your mind wouldn't acknowledge it right and by the time you have to acknowledge it now it's really bad right or do you not avoid and like this started just started happening and you want to nip it in the bud right so I would be interested in the defense mechanisms right that are ging your conscious self and and I would be interested in the character structure what decisions are you then making like are you going anyway right are you having trouble so sometimes you avoid are you then making decisions that make you late and that causes problems how does it impact you once you're there are you engaging differently with people doing your work differently so I want to understand the character structure and ultimately you understand all of this by probing the self that's writing Along on top of it and then what is the experience of that self like do you see that okay this is a problem and I want to address it but like look I know that I'm good at what I do and you know I mean this isn't some like awful thing about me I just have to deal with it right or is your self impacted where you start thinking maybe I can't do this anymore I'm not good enough or you know we want to understand what's the experience of the self right and if we do all of that how is it that we don't get to a place where we can understand that anxiety right and we can make things better so just like in physical Health okay maybe we can't but that is a dramatic outlier if we bring ourselves to Bear we would say you should not have to have this in you right because it is something negative it is making unhappiness for you it is taking away from impowerment right and it's also taking away from humility right because if someone's beating up on themselves if you're beating up on yourself about it then that's not humility right then that that's being sort of falsely persecutory right this it's not an honest humility to that it leads us away from health so it's like we don't want it to be this way right because that is working against agency and gratitude so we can understand it and we can go after it and make it better one of the most common questions I get on the internet and I get a lot of questions is what can be done to improve confidence you know and I've thought a lot about that question and you know what is confidence in the context of what we're talking about now is one reasonable definition of confidence our ability to trust our predispositions and our potentialities enough that were we to encounter scenarios A through Z we feel pretty good that we would respond the right way in a way that um wouldn't threaten our conscious mind at a core level right you know that that we wouldn't um I I used to use the term and and joke a lot in my laboratory uh with the the phrase you know dissolve into a puddle of our own tears right it's kind of this like hyperbolic explanation of of what I think many people fear like they're going to be called upon to answer a question publicly or give a speech or they're going to be at a critical moment in a relationship or something and there and just everything is just going to go so badly wrong that it's just going to dissolve them as a person it's impossible right dissolve in a ble of our own tears is impossible but I think that's a fear that a lot of people live with because we can get into this a little bit later and we will I'm sure you know this notion of like protecting one's ego is seems really vital to to being a human being some level like we don't we don't want to dissolve into a puddle of our own tears so is confidence the ability to trust ourselves in a bunch of different contexts um and at the same time I I do have to raise the this notion of narcissism I think um uh you know this word gets thrown around a lot lately but it seems to me that any um truly psychologically healthy person would also not want to be the idiot that thinks that they're better than they actually are that's a um what are your thoughts on this well I agree with the things that you that you said about confidence except I would add two factors that I think are like really big big factors right right one being State dependence and the other being phenomenology right so think about the state dependence first right when we're talking about confidence it's it's not uniform right or it's not automatically uniform right so if so if you were to tell me oh oh I lack confidence right then I I want to understand is that across the board is like is that a way that you feel about yourself that like I I'm not good enough at anything for example right or do you lack confidence in a specific area right and this is often the case right and it's it's a huge difference right it says that person has the Machinery of confidence so to speak right they have the potentialities and the predispositions for confidence right when that character structure this self-built upon it is engaging with the world right but they're not able to bring it to bear in certain in a certain special situation so to speak so for some people for example the way we most often see this is like the carve out of romance right where because it's so emotionally Laden right and like rejection can feel so bad right that we can see people who are very confident in many many aspects of life but they are very defent about romance and they'll say oh it never works out for me or no one will ever like me right and and you see like that's not how that person actually feels right about themselves as a whole human being right which which which is then we are coming at how to make that better in a way that's very robust right we might say something like hey here's the good news is you have the tools and the Machinery that you need right you're confident in so many ways right in fact maybe in all ways except this one so let's go take a look at like why is that special right and then and that where are we we're back to is it something in the unconscious mind is it something in the in the conscious mind but how that person is engaging right so we have to understand what the state is and if the lack of confidence is State dependent if the person is not confident across the board then again we go back to the same we always go back to the same places to look right but then you might more think okay is is there an impact of childhood trauma or early life trauma that that took away from that person you know the their ability to to gain confidence right because if you have no confidence across the board there's a deeper problem right because there would be this something anyone can be good about at and feel confident in right so the state dependence is very important as is phenomenology so what is your experience of being confident if you tell me well I'm let's say in a different version of this example you say you know actually I'm I'm quite I feel quite confident when I when I walk into a room of of people I say okay I want to understand more about that too right because if I ask questions about that and you say well I feel confident because you know look I'm I'm a pretty smart person I can think on my feet I can I can deal well with with people if something doesn't go right I can recover from it like I've got you know it's why I feel confident you know and say okay that sounds pretty good if you say well I feel confident because I know that I'm better than than everybody right now we have a problem right right like that's not going to go well in other you know in other uh aspects of life and engagement like there's you know it's not going to lead to humility and gratitude like so so where's that coming from and again maybe there's a deeper problem right s about narcissism right which can be a a a reaction right which is a reaction to vulnerability right so then there's was called a reaction formation and now the person uh is actually deeply diffident right but present is very very confident and with a sense of superiority and that that's not a recipe for for happiness right so so in the in approaching it we we do want to understand all the things that you said what are the factors and the the set of predispositions and the set of potentialities but then what's the real world experience of that across situations and what is the person's experience of that inside which is why if we're going to understand and help people like that's the understand part right you know it's why the conveyor belt medicine you know doesn't work right in situations where we're dealing with human beings like mental health right we have to understand something about people to understand whatever they're telling us means otherwise you have no context so you have no knowledge another very common set of questions that I get that I believe is very directly related to this is about beliefs and internal narratives you know people ask me all the time how can can I change what I believe about myself and they also ask how can I change the script in my head how do I typically it's how do I shut down a particular narrative in my head this seems to fit very well in thinking about structure of self because as you pointed out you know the the self or the structure of self includes the unconscious mind you know what's going on below the surface of the water in this Iceberg model what's going on in the conscious mind that the conscious mind is protected by these defense mechanisms that grow up from the unconscious mind from that comes the character structure and then this thing that we call the self right right but when it comes to beliefs and internal narratives those seem to me things that people are pretty well aware of in fact the very example that people are asking me this all the time how to change beliefs internal narratives means they are aware of them it also suggests that for many people out there their beliefs about themselves and their internal narratives are not healthy or at least they don't feel are serving them well or that they are intrusive I don't know how open people are about their beliefs and internal narratives when they come to you in the in your clinical practice but um if you could tell us a little bit about beliefs and internal narratives and uh whether or not they are important to rewire and and and reset this part is extremely important right so imagine for example that I'm saying to myself over and over again that I'm a loser right or I'm not good enough right I mean imagine trying to go through life and someone else were saying that to you all the time right I mean it's worse when it's inside your own head right so what's going on inside of us our internal dialogue our internal narratives are extremely important and here's where we run into a very big problem is that we live in an era and in a culture that is very attuned to Rapid gratification right and all of this that we're talking about can change but it does not change quickly and it's amazing to me when you know you you'll see Insurance paradigms often right no matter what's going on with someone they have 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment right if there's something like we're trying to change beliefs it's a guarantee of failure right because beliefs don't change that fast right so imagine for example that we you know you and I chose a word a random word and we decided to say it 500 times right we' each be saying it tonight right like it's not going to be out of our minds by tonight because we what took a random word and said it 500 times right so imagine that there's something that's highly emotionally Laden and we've said it thousands and thousands and thousands of times right it's not going to go away quickly right but it can go away and during the process of it atrophying right our lives can get better right this is the opposite of hopeless right it's actually very very encouraging but in a world that's rapid gratification right like how do we fix this how do we fix this now that doesn't acknowledge this we hear all the time that a person has failed therapy right like this is said all the time that person failed what does failed therapy mean right I mean I think therapy failed that person right but we we label like oh but person isn't better right but there are things going on inside of us that could take months and months or years to make better now again that's okay if we're aware of what's going on just the very fact that we understand and we're making change right helps us feel better about ourselves and more confident right that we can change all of this but we have to approach it in the right way so let's say that I'm telling myself over and over again um you're not going to get there right and let's say a place I want to go professionally right or no one's ever going to really want you right if if it's I'm looking for a romantic partner right so so imagine these things are going on and they're going on over and over again and you can imagine now that's it's intruded into the unconscious mind it's going on my conscious mind my defensive structure is Shifting in negative ways I'm becoming more avoidant like nothing about this is good and I want it to change and I want it to change to something that says like you can do it right or you're lovable right you can be a good partner to someone where so I want to change it right so imagine now when I start to make that change I'm blazing a path right and and I'm blazing a path where there wasn't a path before right and I can blaze a path and I can go through that path but that path is going to be nothing like maybe the four-lane highway right adjacent to me where the thing that I've been telling myself for years and years and years born of trauma right is is you know is going back and forth right it's got a four-lane highway I'm cutting a path right but over time you cut that path more and more you tread that path more and more you take energy towards that path it becomes better now let's imagine like the path is well LED and it's 12T wide and maybe we can pave the path so more more traffic so to speak goes down it and we're taking energy away from that four-lane Highway and maybe it starts to be overgrown a little bit and there cracks in the road like we can change all of that but we have to understand what's going on and and identify it like what is going on inside of me uh what do I make of it right how do I understand the process of change how do I increase my empowerment during the process of change if we come at it the right way all of this can be changed it's not hardwired in us it's just very very strongly reinforced the same way our brains are built this way so like we don't forget our own names right you know we don't forget where we live you know back when we were hunting and Gathering we don't we don't forget you know where where the good fruits are right I mean this goes on in human life now like we have to remember things it's very very important if something is has high emotional veilance and we've thought it a lot that we don't forget it but that mechanism gets hijacked by things that are not good for us and we can take it back but not if we don't understand what are the tools or the questions that you uh give or ask of patients in order to help them along that pathway um because I totally agree that changing beliefs and internal narratives is very very hard uh just one quick example that meshes with the physical health realm I have a a friend and colleague he's a very accomplished scien who was very overweight for a long period of time he finally made some behavioral changes that allowed him to lose I think it was in upwards of 80 pounds a significant amount of weight felt much better looked much better he just delighted in his ability to do that but then started to reveal to me that he was deathly afraid that he was going to lose control and start eating the way he was before and stop exercising in a way that would return him to his previous weight and feelings of Malay and I said well all the things you're doing are in the direction of Health none of what you're doing speaks to the possibility of this all crumbling this was the dissolve into a puddle of my own tears kind of narrative but at this point coming from him and he just said I know but despite doing all the right things I'm still incredibly afraid that it's going to happen it was as if the the beliefs and the internal narratives hadn't changed despite the fact that he was engaging in the world differently and more positively uh I haven't checked in with him recently to find out where he's at with this now several years later he has kept off most of the weight not all of it gained a little bit back but he's still far healthier than than he ever was so hopefully he's experience some relief but you know what do you tell a patient who uh is saying you know I've got this Loop in my head that tells me I'm not good enough or that even when things are going well they're going to return to that state that I fear so much once again this kind of like you know lack of agency right just lack of agency lack of agency lack of empowerment what what sorts of practical tools can can one give themselves or that you would provide to somebody no matter what is behind what's going on in that person's mind it's addressable but you don't know what it is and how to address it until we ask the question of what's going on inside right so if he's afraid that he's going to gain all that weight back right and he has a history that if significant negative things happen he throws self-care to the wind right that then we'd come at it through that pattern right because he would have a very you know he'd have a good reason to be worried right because this pattern of something bad happens and I can't I don't take care of myself for 6 months you know and maybe someone I'm just making this up and maybe someone in his life is ill or he's fearing a death you know in the future just something that would say that's a very legitimate fear to have like let's let's talk about that like let's look at where that comes from right what got that person into that pattern in the first place right by understanding the pattern and by working together right can we can we save that off right but it could be different the person might say well I'm really I'm having a lot of food cravings right and we like okay what does that mean where's that coming from or maybe he's depressed and when and he's getting depressed and when he's depressed he can't stop eating more right so you know you would look or it might just be plain old fear like this is so good right that that I'm worried it will go away right then we might want to reinforce like okay like you know you're a person who's able to use circumspection and perseverance and preserve goodness right so like you do that and you do that really well so let's let's make sure we're doing that here right so you know a lot of times a person is worried but that worry is coming through the lens of Health like they're healthy right so then we look at okay can we Soo that worry where where's that coming from right we can come at it and reinforce the positive but if there is something negative there's a trauma driven cycle there's depression there Cravings we we can understand that too so so I come back to this idea that there's answers to just about everything and in a very regimented scientific way it's not that hard to come to them right just like in Physical Medicine like we have the par we have the tools that we need to bring to bear but you have to understand the person again if you come in and say I'm not feeling good and someone else comes in and says I'm not feeling good the doctor better not do the same things right says how are you not feeling good okay let me understand that and then let let me map that also to you whatever underlying state of health you may have or diagnoses you may have the same is true in mental health if we just apply that then it's remarkable the good that we do which I've seen very consistently across 20 years of doing this not only in my own practice but like who are the people who do really really well trying to understand and take care of people including sometimes not doing too much and realizing like hey this person is okay like there's a state of health here but this person is worried how do we reassure them right how do we help someone living a good life live a better life right if we're going to do all of this we have to approach people as individuals it's just I mean the science tells us that and Common Sense tells us that too but if we do that a person can get to the place they want to be I'd like to address a different person as an example a hypothetical person okay and I'm certain there are many many of these people out there these are the sorts of people that think okay there's a self and a mind and a unconscious mind Etc but you know at some level why not just do what needs to be done in life like the people that don't want to explore the self you know because to me it seems so absolutely clear that just as it's important to have a certain level of endurance strength flexibility so that one can extract the most joy and agency and gratitude and empowerment and hum humility from life that it makes sense to explore the self to ask you know where am I internally strong where am I internally weak you know where might I perceive myself as strong where as I'm actually weak right these seems like these seem like very important if not crucial questions to ask but I know that there are a certain number of people in the world think all of that is just kind of a waste of time right it's all about doing stuff it's it's all you know why explore the self you know and um I think the rest of us are looking at that person often and thinking well you're exactly the kind of person that needs to do this because of the ways that you grate on other people but but not always right sometimes these people just appear to be just very effective they're all about the outward expression of what they're doing and I certainly don't know how other people feel waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night and throughout the day but to the person that feels like introspection and exploring maybe even Excavating for trauma that they haven't been in touch with or haven't dealt with yet but the person that feels that all of that is is kind of not really worth the effort and it's all about action you know what can we say to that person or those people put differently does one need to change and need to believe in the power of these sorts of approaches in order for them to work uh we often hear that people don't change until they want to change and um and could we also say perhaps that even for the people that feel like they're functioning extremely well in all domains of life I know no such people and I know some very high achieving people as you do too I know no such people uh the only people who seem to exist in that sphere are the narc the clear narcissists that to them just seem like they're doing great but everyone else can't stand them by the way narcissist no one else can stand you um what do what do we say to to those individuals because I think it's a big swath of humanity and I think it um it accounts for a lot of suffering in the world including their own suffering yeah so I would make an appeal to common sense right so imagine you you take someone who doesn't know anything about health they they don't know they don't know how to exercise they don't know how to eat well they just don't know and they're very really really unhealthy right they're overweight they have low energy they have sleep apnea they no need to have you and and and you why not just say to them well like just go be different like be in fact be different now why aren't you different right now right like of course we would never do that because it's a it's absurd and by the way also would be cruel right so it's absurd and it's cruel so we would never do that right let's say now you let's say we fast forward some period of months say make it up right and we see that person and wow they are much healthier they have much more energy they've lost weight they're they're physically fit a lot will have gone on in between those two snapshots of that person that person has to learn a lot right how does one take care of oneself right then more specifically how do I take care of myself right what healthy foods you know will I like what healthy foods will I will I eat how will I put that on the table what kind of exercises can work for me how will they work for me how do I strengthen muscle how do I strengthen the heart how do I increase lung capacity right there's learning there's diligence um you know there's stick tutiven right there's resilience that's how the person gets there right it is no different in its mental health right if we say well you you feel you feel different across the board or you feel Superior across the board or whatever it is like life isn't going well and you don't have things you want and you know the selft talk is negative then we say well look but just be different right now right I mean it's remarkable that people will say that at times not just in a way that's denigrating and awful for others but to themselves too right I mean I hear people say this most often to themselves like I why am I not just different right I I want to be different or what's wrong with me that I'm not and I'm like yeah it's like everything else like you have to apply understanding and work and effort like the good news is you can get to whatever change you want I mean a person can get to whatever reasonable change that person wants like you know I'm 54 years old I'm not going to climb Mount Everest I'm not a mountain climber right but if I want to like I want to learn to climb some mountains I want to get out there and do some things I can go do that right the same thing is true with our Mental Health goals but not at the snap of a finger not by Magic right it's through applying the same science and Common Sense combination of Science and common sense that we apply to other things that's why we go through this procedure of unconscious mind conscious mind the structure and function of the self because that's how that's how it's done that's how the after snapshot looks different than the before from the mental health perspective as well that's very helpful and I think it's going to be very helpful to a lot of people in thinking about what to think about what sorts of questions to to address maybe even whether or not to get therapy and hopefully we'll remap their Notions of therapy I mean of course this critically relies on the therapist being good to excellent um and I think in the previous um sitdown we had around the uh in the episode on trauma specifically you mapped out a number of the features of quality therapy so we can refer people to that uh if they're thinking about it's timestamped in that episode as so you know what to look for in a therapist what how how to assess whether or not it's going well or not whether or not to move on or or or stay put with that therapist and so on you've been telling us a lot about the structure of our of the self unconscious mind conscious mind defense mechanisms character structure self we haven't talked so much about the function of self I realize it's been woven in here or there yes um could you tell us about the function of self self are the functions of self verb actions I mean are these things that um we are all doing right now that reflect our character structure are these things that um we can change more readily than trying to snap our fingers and say okay I'm now going to be a more altruistic person because I can decide that right now but then ultimately I have to engage in some altruistic behaviors to to um lend support to that um again same with the parallel that I can't just snap my fingers and say lower blood pressure you know I have to do some meditative practi some cardiovascular training and things of that sort uh what what is this function of self thing what goes into the functions of self okay so so just stepping back to the framing right so there're these two pillars upon which we build our lives the structure of self and the function of self and we've been talking as you said more about the structure which is more the nouns of it like there is an unconscious what is in that unconscious for example there are defense mechanisms uh uh how are we using them like it's not all nouns but it's more what are those things and then we start talking about how we put them into practice the function of self is much more the verbs right so if the structure is more nouns the function is more the verbs right the actual engagement right so so that would start with an awareness of eye so a function of self has to start with an awareness like there's a person there isn't there is a me that is separate from others right and I have responsibility for this I right like it is me no one else is guiding it like it's me I know there's a me okay then on top of that we start seeing defense mechanisms in action right because we're thinking about function right we're aware that there's an eye but the first thing that starts happening to that eye are unconscious things right so the defense mechanisms be because we're not choosing them right they start doing things automatically so if for example I have a a defense of avoidance right then I'm not thinking you know if it's I'd like to meet a new person but I automatically am shying away right then that's not it's not good it's a factor right but it's a factor I'm not aware of until I start this process of introspecting right so the defense mechanisms are then kind of determining the lay of the land right so in that example I'm sorry to interrupt but sorry to interrupt but in that example um the the Turning Away you describe as reflexive so you're you're talking about someone perhaps would like to have a romantic partner or meet somebody um have a companion and they go to the grocery store and somebody says something as they're reaching for the milk and you know there's that moment of opportunity where they could say something back but instead they just kind of go oh yeah thanks and then they they kind of move away and then they the narrative in their head might be oh gosh that that was silly or but they don't really think about the the alternate possibility or there might be no narrative they they just they head off to they head off to the produce section yeah and then they go home and and some says oh anything happened at the you mean any one at the groceries no right because it's all unconscious right okay right now again we can can we explore that and change that yes right but it's important to understand that whatever that nest of defense mechanisms is like that's what I've got right now right and I'm living through that right now right that that's is performing a function right just because it's an unconscious function does it mean it's it's not a very very important function I can see in that example how it protects the conscious mind from risk because there's always a possibility of rejection there's a possibility of over interpretation of what the other person is talking to them for right like is the person interested in them or whether or not this is just you know F friendly banter um the sort that anyone would have next to anybody that it's not special to them so I can see how the the uh the unconscious turning away is protective against all the negative possibilities and in some sense is pretty rational because the the probability that that one interaction could ratchet up to a a life of companionship and and romance with somebody is is in uh exceedingly small really although you could imagine a set of data points where you string together you know like 5-second Clips you know all like the time something like that has happened right so maybe this is a person that you know intermittently like people are interested in them or saying Hey or saying hello or showing interest you could string all those together and the person hasn't noticed one of them right and then could have a very negative see nobody no one wants me no one's interested in me or whatever the person is saying but but like it's different if you see from the outside like it's objectively different but that person doesn't know and that's why after being an awareness there is an i the next thing that I think of in the in the function of self is is the defense mechanisms in action what are some other examples of defense mechanisms in action because I think there's immense interest in this you know the idea that we have unconscious processes in us that are reaching up out of the iceberg and preventing us from seeing our life and ourselves the way that it actually is occurring and perhaps preventing us from achieving these uh ideals of agency and gratitude empowerment and humility you know I mean these seem like very powerful and important forces and and I and I know many other people out there want to understand whether or not what we're doing and what we're feeling and experiencing whether or not that that is serving us well or not so I think the the the place to start is to say that there's something very very complicated going on right the the part of the iceberg underneath the surface right that biological supercomputer that's running at a million thoughts and a million actions and million internal processes a second right is constantly shifting our defensive structure so so it's complicated and you can almost imagine that like one leaves and another comes in and they're shifting and there's a little bit of one and some of another like so it's a very complicated process but we can look at it and un understand so so an example of a defense mechanism that's very common and can cause us a lot of problems is projection right so I'll give two examples of of projection so so one is the experience of sitting in a car right and being stuck in traffic being a little bit late right and feeling Bel leaguered right I mean this has happened to me more times than I can count but at some point I started through my own therapy looking at like what what's going on in me right when when I'm doing this right so think about the be feeling be leaguered right as if what does that mean like there's something called traffic that exists and has a mind and wants to thwart me right is it individual cars is it the people in the cars right what's going on is I'm having a perception of hostility I feel Bel leaguered right but it's it's anger and frustration inside of me right I'm I'm the one feeling angry and frustrated there's there's there's no one and nothing but me that's feeling anything about this right but I have this sense of the world around me being hostile because I'm projecting my anger outward right now think this isn't good because instead of sitting in traffic and saying look maybe it totally makes sense that I'm stuck in traffic and that that I'm not happy like maybe I I should leave a little bit earlier and I wouldn't be late or if it's I'm going to work should I live closer to work I could make a whole set of decisions that I'm not making right or maybe I I know I thought it was going to be a 15-minute drive and like there was an accident right and okay there are things that I can't control am I supposed to control everything right if if you think about what can I control being aware of that and what can I not control right then it can make the situation much better so this doesn't happen with this frequency and it also takes away the anger and the frustration right so I think that's a good example because it it happens a lot it's very very common but projection then also happens with people right so let's say you and I work together and we're we we're going to do something collaborative together and I'm just not having a good day and something negative happened before I came to work and you know I'm not at my best and I'm a little bit I'm a little bit irritable and frustrated right this happens all the time where then the person sits down with someone and then I'm being irritable and frustrated which doesn't feel good to you right and and you may become irritable and frustrated right and then I say oh look he's irritable and frustrated right but even if you don't the fact that I feel that way right that projection often would lead me to to think that it's you who's that way here I come wanting to do this job and you're not at your best it's me who's not at my best right but we do this all the time and then we make incorrect or inaccurate attributions right so so projection it's it's an example of a defense mechanism that can cause us a lot of trouble right a lot of trouble uh another can be displacement where uh if I'm feeling anger or frustration say in a certain realm than I the idea of feeling it at work and then kicking the dog right like it it's not good that we do that we're not acknowledging what's going on inside of us at work what we could change what we could make better and the dog doesn't want to be kicked right and the dog is often you know also the family right and and it could be physical or could be through words right but the idea that that there's something negative being generated in us but but inside we're we're perceiving that it's coming from somewhere else right I mean the thought is all things to lead us astray right when when there are negative defenses right there going to be positive defenses too such as altruism right that that someone could do something negative to me right and instead of me passing that along I could decide no I'm going to do something I'm going to do something nice for the next person I have an opportunity to do something nice for right like that's a defense and sometimes we could think of it and decide that way but there are people who react that way like there's something negative that happens and they respond with something that's that's different from that so defense mechanisms can work against us they can work for us they're complicated they're combinations of them but we can look inside and say for example if I'm using projection all the time right and I think everyone around me is kind of always angry and frustrated right and there's always bad traffic right but then as we start to talk about it more it becomes apparent that there's a lot I'm angry about right but I'm not aware of it then then reflection or therapy right or a good friend we're talking to can help us see right that hey this is going on inside of me right and that can really help us same with use of humor like if I'm using humor and I'm I'm kind of decompressing uncomfortable situations or things that make me feel uncomfortable maybe that greases the wheels of social progress but maybe over time I come to use humor in a way that's self-denigrating right well that's not so good anymore but I may not be aware of the shift just because I can maybe be funny in certain situations that I'm now not using that for myself anymore I'm using it against myself and by talking to people by reflection like we can be aware of the defensive structure that's going on inside of us and then there's not an automaticity to it if you point out that I'm using projection a lot I can start to be aware of that just like if someone let's say you were with me at the grocery store right and someone says something nice and I shy away and you say Hey you know you didn't weren't even aware someone said hello to you and then I said say I want to be more aware of that like I want I don't want that thing to happen unconsciously so maybe now I think okay anytime someone I don't know says something to me I'm going to just stop and think like what's going on here right is that person being friendly to me is it is are they just you know it's just person exchanging money at the cash register like what's going on so we take what's unconscious and we make it conscious so that we can change it sounds to me like exploring and thinking about our reflexes is what's really key here um the example of displacement that you gave you know kicking the dog I couldn't help but um smile not because I think it's a good thing to do I never once kicked my dog by the way folks terrible thing to do also he was the size of a boulder it would have injured me more than it would have injured him but I never would do such a thing however in Academia there's this um phenomenon that's very common that that I refer to as trickle down anxiety where the person running the laboratory is inevitably under a tremendous amount of stress grants and papers Etc and graduate students in postdocs will immediately be familar with what I'm describing but um for those of you that haven't gone to graduate school um this will be a little bit foreign but you'll think of other examples where when the lab head is under stress it's incredibly common for labhe heads to walk through the laboratory and start asking about experiments and telling people to do additional experiments and basically just assigning busy work to people or pressuring what simply cannot be moved along any faster and when I was a graduate student I worked for somebody who was the exact opposite of this phenotype when I was a postdoc frankly I worked with someone who was a little bit of that phenotype although I still liked working for him very much but I used to have a response that at least for me was adaptive which was I would always say I'm working as fast as I carefully can because no scientist ever wants to uh somebody to cut Corners no good scientist anyway um but trickle down anxiety is common in every occupation I think we see this sort of displacement all the time where someone's anxious and so they go start creating anxiety for other people I mean you can just as you're describing I was just seeing how pathologic that is for everybody involved so the the academic the trickle down anxiety that you were just talking about is it's a related but but it's a different defense mechanism and it's projective identification right which is which is causing others to feel the way that you feel in order to get your needs met right is this a form of projection and actually perhaps you could um clarify the definition of projection versus displacement versus projective identification yeah so projection is when you don't own it so so it's not me who's mad it's you right so I don't own that I'm mad at all right I just think that it's you even though I'm the one who's mad right displacement is what comes out of us or what what we're our attribution can shift right it's it's not this person who's making me angry it's that person because that's a safer person right to to to be angry at right or if I'm then going to take out my anger right instead of metaphorically kicking the person who might who might respond to me in a way I don't want maybe I kick the dog that's helpless to respond back right so that's displacement projective identification is there's there's an expression of an emotional state inside of a person that then becomes contagious to other people even though the person isn't trying to do that if the person says I'm going to make you anxious that's not a defense mechanism anymore right so here's an example I think I think this is the best example of projective identification so for a little bit of time at work I would occasionally lose my keys right so now I'm trying to go and I I can't find my keys right so they say oh I don't know where my keys are right so I start expressing something right and I'm anxious and I'm tense right now people around me hear that right and what do they start feeling they start feeling anxious and tense the way that I do right and now they're like well now they want to now they want to find my keys right they want to help me so that I stop spreading anxiety and tension into the whole environment around me right so then they help me find my keys I say thank you my own emotional state comes down and upon reflection I think look I don't want to do that right I got my I'm getting my needs met by making other people feel in a way that's like not a good or comfortable way to feel so here's a way around that like put my keys in the same place every day right so then I can avoid that because it doesn't feel good to me like then if I get out to my car like I find you know I'm a little bit I'm breathing a little heavy like I don't doesn't feel good cuz I was just agitated right and I did that to other people too right so so it's an example of how projective identification works and it's kind of a simple example but it shows it's happening all the time you know all these things are happening all the time but we can become aware of it then I don't lose my keys I don't have to feel bad about I don't have to activate myself for no reason and I don't have to activate other people for no reason so so thinking and reflecting like change that thing for the better and it can do it with much bigger things too thank you for those clarifications I'd like to touch on humor for a moment obviously humor is a wonderful thing or can be a wonderful thing I've also seen a lot of examples of where very smart and or accomplished people because those are not always um uh the same thing use sarcasm as a form of humor and it can be very funny but I have to imagine based on everything I'm hearing from you today that um there's a form of sarcasm which is an unhealthy defense I'm thinking of the person that um no matter what someone else says that's positive or or no matter what someone does that could be viewed as positive they find some way to diminish it by like through sarcastic humor right I I I see this a lot and I think closely nested with sarcasm is um cynicism um in fact uh I have a family member I won't name who they are to protect the not so innocent who used to be very cynical um and I want to ask you know what is the the about cynicism and and they said well I have had a particular uh genre of of schooling growing up a formal schooling where if anyone behaved um too happy expressed too much happiness rather too much delight they were viewed as stupid like like as if to be happy is to um to be unaware of of of the sophistication and the importance of things in life right um and I hope that this is unrelatable to most people listening but um I do think that sarcasm is is a double-edged blade um in this sense and that cynicism is is perhaps um uh double-edged blade as well but that it might even be worse than sarcasm because it's a way of really reflecting back what's by definition what's not good about life what's not good about what's happening and and it does seem protective right it protects one from disappointment if you're already disappointed how could you be further disappointed it's also seems to me like a bit of a power move it's like you're going to be happy well I'm going to take that away for from everybody like as something that's like for myself and um does any of this actually hold in the inside of the CL clinical literature um because again I enjoy a good sarcastic joke in fact there's a collaboration around a sarcastic joke it can be truly funny to everybody but um sarcasm and cynicism um I feel like are often used to cut down what would otherwise be um benevolence or or or bonding experiences yeah absolutely look I grew up in central New Jersey humor is a weapon right or it certainly can be right and people can be very aggressive through humor so so acting out which is is letting our aggression flow right that's a defense right so just being aggressive and pushing someone back right however that means like I if I don't feel good about myself I want you to feel not so good about yourself right is where we start getting into into Envy right and humor can be used that way so so that that sort of biting sarcastic humor is a form of acting out it's a form of aggression right it's not humor as a healthy defense right we can call it the same thing but we could also call it different things it's just a Nuance of our language right if if if humor can be a defense like I I trip and fall I make a little joke people are laughing at with me instead of at me right hey humor is a good defense I made myself feel better made things flow flow more easily but if I'm using sarcastic humor to assail someone right then that's not it's not that thing anymore right you know now it's a manifestation of aggression right and the idea that cynicism you know is is more then we're talking about a worldview right like sarcasm is something that can be done now like we can make a sarcastic joke funny or not then it's over right um but cynicism is is a way of coming at the world is a different kind of Defense right the idea that hey it's like the fox and the sour grapes like I don't I I don't think think there's anything good to be had anyway right so you can't take anything away from me it can't make me feel worse right I I already feel uh very very bad about the world and about everybody in it and I'm protecting myself that way like that's then an unhealthy defense because what does that lead to it leads to isolation at least to mistrust you know we we know that people are happy if they live through altruism and gratitude and they're well connected with others so so the cynical point of view which again to some degree being in the world builds some cynic ISM in us right like that that's okay that's part of that's a part of awareness in some sense but I think what you're talking about is a very pervasive sinicism that then is an unhealthy defense that is very harmful to others like the idea that I I feel lousy about everything and if you don't I'm going to try and bring you down right like too much happiness we'll label that as something right we label it as stupid right so now it's like it's not okay to be happier than some sort of cynical Baseline right and again there's nothing about altruism and gratitude like that's not happy right I mean who who's happy in that situation Cy the people who are overly cynical are not happy and the people around them are not happy nobody's happy thanks for the clarification on New Jersey a good portion of my biological family is from New Jersey come out well armed I I I adore them but it's true there was once a moment at a family gathering where somebody said oh let's um let's hug or something and the reaction was like oh we're going to hug now you know it was like it was it was it was it was entirely sarcastic and cynical and like and the the hug that resulted from that was this like little like like distant Pats kind of thing it was and now I'm laughing about it and it's funny and and they're very loving people but you're right it's a it's a a different style of of humor and discourse yeah so you've been talking about these two pillars of the self and who we are and how things play out in the world for us as the structure of self and the function of self and in terms of the function of self you describe self-awareness this notion or this realization that there is an i there's a me and then we've been talking about defense mechanisms in action how these play out in in the real world both positive and negative it seems to me that a lot of what is happening here in terms of understanding the function of self has to do with like what we pay attention to and like where we place our our efforts or choose to not place our attention and not place our efforts do I have that right right yeah salience is a is a huge Concept in I think in in human existence right I mean there are thousands upon thousands of things that that you or I could be paying attention to right now right but but we're we're not paying attention to anything except what we're doing right here so we are gating out so many other thoughts ideas narratives inside now if something were to shift very quickly if we heard a loud noise right our attention would shift right so so our attention is it's Focus we're Salient to one another because this is what we've Chosen and we're focusing our minds and we are also somewhere inside of us aware that we could shift away from it if something more important like something dangerous like were to happen right so it lets us be here and be Salient to one another and have this conversation right but in the course of Life what's Salient to us is so complicated and determined by so many factors that is absolutely worth a lot of attention to so so one example is so many people have a negative internal dialogue that's running in them over and over again or they're running through images events you know they may be traumatic events or things that they're not happy with images of themselves in negative ways um that that these internal narratives or internal images can become so strong that there's no room for anything else so you know an example would be a a person who uh who really really loved music right and could have you know just in addition to enjoying music like had like good thoughts while listening to music like you know what I could go do this right and and and had a history of of like that really working out well like following his interests and and like really creating sort of goodness in his life right who now was going for long drives like longer than would be needed to go somewhere get something like why the extra time in the car and I had had a presumption okay the person's listening to music and thinking but but it didn't quite add up and then I learned that the person is not listening to music right that they're using that time so that the internal narrative right which was a very very negative repeated internal negative you're not going to get anywhere you're not going to make anything of of yourself right it could be there in his mind right so it was a form of self-punishment right it was a form of of taking the anger and frustration inside and enacting it towards himself and that was so salient that this person could not see his way to any goodness like nothing could change nothing could get any better like felt very sure and very resolved about that and the answer was yeah that's right right nothing can get any better with this constant Mantra running over and over again but things can get better right if that becomes less Salient over time and your own thoughts and Reflections become more Salient so at the end of that shift you know that narrative that was still there but it was weakened right because it takes time to really change things so it was very much weakened the person was listening to music again those thoughts had kind of come back to the surface and they were being sort of jumbled you know in ways that that brought new and interesting thoughts coming from them and the person was in an entirely different place and like completely changed their life right I mean this is it's this is true right it's a dramatic example but dramatic examples inform us right where the salience shifted and then the life shifted after that what you're describing in terms of this specific example um doesn't resonate with me in terms of my own experience although as you point out it's very striking it's very dramatic um but it resonates with me from a different perspective um I'm not seeking a free clinical session here but uh but to give meet to the example I'm about to ask you for insight on you know I've never allowed myself to stay in a bad professional situation for very long you know when things didn't feel right or when I sense someone I was working with or four wasn't the right situation I got out despite if I were to really think about it there could have been pretty severe long-term consequences fortunately it all worked out in fact so much so that I would say um you know I pay attention to whether or not people I work with and four are of the sort that I want to be working with and if I sense a particular type of danger I'll look at that and I'm I'm 100% so far knock on wood but 100% so far on recognizing later that it was a great decision to move on and on the flip side of it I've made I believe excellent decisions in terms of who to work with in terms of my podcasting in terms of my academic career Etc but I've had to move aways from people that just weren't right for me I don't think they were truly Bad actors but thank goodness I moved away and thank goodness I found the these other wonderful people to work with however there are circumstances that have been repetitive in my life where I've just be honest repeatedly made not good decisions about who to be involved with over fairly long periods of time and there can even be an awareness or I should say there has been an awareness like this isn't a good situation and yet I'm persisting in in seeking out this and similar types of situations so I consider myself a at least partially rational human being with some degree of introspection you know when I look at this and I think okay this is a a choice to focus on placing myself in I have to assume it placing myself into situations that are challenging for me in a way that I know is preventing me from living in certain ways that I want and from being quote unquote happy in certain ways that I want when you hear a scenario like that like I can do it over here but I can't seem to do it over here in fact I see myself doing it the wrong way here right a little bit different than the example you gave a moment ago because the guy was driving to work not listening to music but wasn't putting two and two together about what was going on but when somebody can see what's going on I think this might even be called the repetition compulsion or yeah sometimes you know what is that about are are people trying to work out something specific or are they deliberately creating some friction to accomplish something else right I mean I realize this could be infinitely complex and again I'm not trying to extract um uh a clinical insight for for my own sake I started the clock on that thank you um but I think a lot of people do this oh yes they they do what they know they shouldn't be doing they know they shouldn't be doing it duh I just said that two ways and but they do it like it must serve them in some way you know think about um when you get a dog and you talk to a dog trainer they say you know dogs do what works right they get a reward for doing something they're going continue doing it uh you apply that to the same sort of thing I'm describing for myself and that I've observed in other people and you must say it must work for them you hear this in kind of pop psychology like it must work for them like it must be solving something why the hell do I do this why do people do this is it real pathology or is it around about about way to get to something else that's actually pretty adaptive yeah I mean instead of defining it as pathology I would not Define it as pathology I would Define it as humanness if humanness is not in and of itself pathological then all you're doing there is is describing something that is common widespread across human beings now it doesn't mean we can't understand it and make it healthier right I work in a discipline that wants to put a number on everything right label it as something and then do something about it that's more often than not ineffective right because we're not looking at things in a top- down way of what is Human Experience what are the natural aspects of human experience that are less than ideal right that we can then understand and make better if we come at it that way then we see ah this is a great example because here's where structure meets function right so on the structure side we said okay there's defense mechanisms and we imagine the branches right that are that are coming up from the unconscious mind right and here it meets function right defense mechanisms in action on the function side then determining salience so what I would imagine in your example my image is that your defensive structure when you're doing the thing that's effective right the professional decisions right looks elegant right like there's Harmony to where those branches are the Consciousness is sitting in between it you can see you can see the Elegance to it right that I can just imagine shifting right when to when you're not doing the thing effectively right because now you're using an entirely different defensive structure which is going to function differently and create different salients and I imagine that it's convoluted and you know that it's sort of Peace meal that it's not something elegant right so you say okay what does that actually mean let's translate it into what are the actual defenses so let's think about what you're not doing when you're making good decisions in the professional realm right you are not using denial or avoidance or rationalization or projection or projective identification or acting out right there are all these things that you are not doing that are the sort of unhealthy defenses beckoning to us like oh wouldn't it be easier to Kick the Can down the road right you know wouldn't it be easier to just no no everything's okay everything's going to work out okay wouldn't it be easier instead of being angry at one person who is really intrinsic to the environment if you you know it's actually somebody else you know are you displacing it projecting that's how people that's how we get ourselves into trouble right and and if that's going on then that set of defense mechanisms in action right creates something that obscures the ability to make good judgment right but with none of those things going on then what are you doing what you're applying your intelligence you're applying your discernment right you're applying your desire to make things better you're able to look at it you're able to bring diligence perseverance right you're able to bring healthy aspects of self to the question and decide like oh I don't want this and it should be different right and there again what's going on there's a complexity under the surface but now we're coming up towards Simplicity right we're coming up towards the things that are healthier that are simplistic if we look then okay what's going on if you're making the same mistakes over and over again well we could you know we would dive under the hood and really look and say okay what are you doing there but it has to be an array of unhealthy defenses there's no other thing it could be so we would say okay are you using a are you using avoidance maybe a little maybe a lot what about denial what about rationalization what about projection like you know you go through the unhealthy defenses and and you see what is it that you're bringing to bear that is leading you astray and then and then of course the goal is to use the the role modeling and you role model for yourself how to be healthy right so let's take that role modeling and apply it to the thing you're of carving out and and treating differently and and that's the reason when people talk about repetition compulsions you know that's it's not a formal term because because what we're really talking about is repetition right and we're interested like why why do we repeat things now that's one that's one reason right because we bring an unhealthy set of defenses and then at the end of the day things come out the same because we're bringing an unhealthy set of defenses right there can be other motivations that are related to all of that and there's again there's complexity to it but but the compulsion part can be that we can reenter situations that didn't go well with the idea that we're going to we're going to fix what happened in the past we're going to make ourselves feel better we're going to take away the mark of trauma because remember trauma doesn't care about the clock or the calendar so that's why you'll see someone who has had say five abusive relationships that looked very much the same right and is about to enter the sixth right and you said it's not because hopefully in most cases not because that person like wants to be hurt right I mean sometimes that's a different problem right but but there can be a drive inside of us to try and fix something if I can make it work this time I won't have to feel so bad about the other five right so an attempt to change the past through one's current actions right which is rooted in the lyic system and how and how trauma affects us and how again it's outside the clock in the calendar so that kind of magic so to speak can happen so the brain can seek that magic but again there are unhealthy defenses coming into play right there has to be denial right otherwise the person would map you know if the same thing happened five times and this looks the same it's probably going to happen now right so so anytime you think a person most often it's us right you know is smart enough or worldly enough to like know better which like happens all the time right then look for the answer right you say well shouldn't that person know better than to get into the six abusive relationship the answer is like yes right like because it's not that hard if you saw a set of circumstances five times to map that the six is going to have the same outcome right the person would do that in other scenarios right so then you say right that is true so now let's look for why the person doesn't recognize that and again we go down into the structure of self and the function of self defense mechanisms and action salience the things that we're talking about now does that fit yeah it makes sense and what what comes to mind is the idea of um getting into a car that you know is going to get into an accident over and over and over again but being quite cognizant of safety and its importance in every other domain of Life yes not even jaywalking right but getting into like if if certain Ubers arrived with a little flashing light that said this ride is going to have an accident it's like getting getting into that vehicle and I see this in others as well yes and and it raises all sorts of um questions like um is the person actually uh unconsciously afraid of the vehicle arriving where they want to go because then um like are people actually afraid of things working out um I mean this gets to something that I'm so sorry to can I can I say for that's why you have to know that the person right like who is that person right why do they not want to get in that car right are they afraid they're not going to get somewhere they afraid they're going to get somewhere right but ultimately we're looking for unhealthy defenses and I I so want to emphasize that that I you know I will often think that the aspect of my education that's most helpful in me doing my job when I'm when I'm in the job as as a practicing psychiatrist is is actually my mathematics minor right because there's a lot more math to this right people tend to think oh mental health it's all it's all esoteric and you can sort of say anything you know anything you you want and like there's no way of proving or disproving it's it's not like that at all right there's a mathematical aspect to it so if you do the correct logical Common Sense thing right in all aspects of your life except one and you're like a hundred times more intelligent than you need to be to figure it all out right then then if there's a carve out we say look that's of huge interest right I mean the probability that we're going to find something interesting there's 100% right because we know that you know better we know that you do better but but why why here so like that's so interesting right like that's where the x marks the spot like let's go dig there right so then when we go and dig there like we're going to find something right and and we'll see what is that like do we find that like oh it's an array of of really unhealthy defense mechanisms maybe we find that do we find that there's a deep unconscious motivation right like we might find that too right there we might find a lot of things right but we're going to find them if we go back to what is the structure of s what is the function of self if we go and look like that x marks the spot means there's Pay Dirt there right and then when we figure that out then we go through and we can make things change so if it's a deep-seated trauma driven unconscious motivation that is resulting in an unhealthy array of defense mechanisms well let's go look at that right let's look at the trauma let's take the thing that's unconscious and and bring it to Consciousness right then we can make that better and that array of unhealthy defenses again we're not going to change it overnight but can we change it very very significantly pretty rapidly probably yes and we can almost entirely change it across time so there's a mathematical aspect of this that I think is so important to point out because you know mental health just even as a field right just me we all want to be mentally healthy like there's a rhyme and reason to it that yes it follows science and yes it also follows common sense and if we apply those things we get to answers it's very reassuring um thank you thinking about the functions of self and again just to remind myself and and other people you it starts with self-awareness involves defense mechanisms in action then there's the salience piece but paying attention to what's inside of us as well as what's external and then you're now describing a lot of you know choices choic making and and behavior and action in the yes I have to assume that for for the person trying to improve themselves and get to agency and gratitude uh that paying attention to all of these is is important but of course if a defense mechanism is unconscious we can't simply decide okay I'm going to see the unconscious defense mechanism does that mean that we should ask ourselves about what is most Salient to us um or should we be focusing on our behavioral choices I mean in the example I just gave I'm aware of my behavioral choices making certain decisions to engage with certain people and and not with others uh but should I be asking for instance you know what Salient like like what are the thoughts leading up to that decision um in other words how does salience of internal and external uh cues and processes um relate to behavior and which of these should we be paying attention to if our goal is to eventually change our Behavior so so think about we're starting we're sort of starting at the bottom right so we're starting with okay there is an I right and that's just not not just an apprehension right there's a lot to that right so so for example I know someone who who is doing sort of mirror meditation staring into the mirror right looking back itself with an with a desire to be aware like there is a me like this me is in the world right this is the first I've ever heard of such a practice um except when I was in elementary school maybe it was the nth grade I had a teacher who t talked about look gave us an assignment to to look in the mirror and ask ourselves questions but if I understand correctly you think there's utility to people spending a few minutes or more looking in the mirror and thinking about oneself in the eye as a way to build up this self-awareness do I have that right if you want to take the best care of yourself that you can right you want to understand yourself the best you can you want to make your life the best it can be right then if there are answers right let's say the answers are in five or 10 different cupboards right look in all of them right I mean that's that's the idea right that if if we want to know something look everywhere for it and also realize what we are building right what we are creating may be a recipe there may be things from different cupboards that overlap so the way to translate that practically is to say to find the answers to what what is either ailing us why we're repeating things we don't want to repeat or even if things are going okay but we want them to be going better because we don't quite feel the peace and contentment we want to feel then look everywhere so in this the function of Self in the function of self start with the eye right there are ways of increasing self-awareness you know they can range from contemplation of self to meditation to looking in the mirror right there are things that we can do to more strongly emphasize to oursel that there is an eye and this eye is going through life right then we know that they're defense mechanisms and that they're present that they're acting in us right we can't just see them because they're unconscious but if we start thinking about them we can learn about them right and that's where salience comes into play sence kind of points both ways right salans can point us towards the unconscious mind right oh I I realize I'm doing this over and over again or I'm saying this thing to myself over and over again where's that coming from we start becoming curious about ourselves and we look to the unconscious mind and then we also look to the conscious mind that that's why after salience is behavior like what am I doing right and a lot of times we don't know just examples of we don't know why we're doing things right someone who wants to lose weight but always goes to the grocery store and comes home and is like has some sense of surprise that there are things there that they don't want to eat right like why am I behaving in a certain way why does certain things bother me when other things don't right why am I really touchy about one thing and not another why might there be things that bother others and not me or vice versa right so so you know we're looking at what's going on inside of us and then how we respond right because how what may be upsetting me or what's going on inside of me both conscious and unconscious right is then determining how I'm acting how I'm behaving in the world around me if I want a better job but I never take an interview for another job I'm not going to get another job if I want a romantic partner but I automatically turn away from anyone who Smiles at me I'm not going to have a romantic partner right if I want life to be better and there's a certain thing I repeat and I don't want to repeat that I want to understand myself better so I can change the behavior and that's why the the the function of self ends with strivings right because strivings are into the future I know there is an eye I know there's a network and web of defense mechanisms in action I know that there's salience going on inside of me and I'm only going to pay attention to a few things from the thousands I could pay attention to I want to be aware of that and have more control over that then I'm enacting behaviors I'm engaging in the world around me and ultimately I want things right I want life to be better I want to have that feeling that you can get to I want to be in the state of of agency and gratitude so again these two pillars structure of self function of self that's where all the answers are so they're all the cupboards right there there these five Cupboards in the structure of self and five in the function of self and I know there'll be a you know we'll have it out there in a PDF right because you can go back there and that's where the vast majority of answers are to both understanding and routes to change what you just described as incredibly helpful it's absolutely apparent to me why looking in all the cupboards is so key it's also apparent that um many different aspects of psychology and Psychiatry um at least as I understand them might probe for instance just at the level of behavior you know I think this is the the just do it Mantra well just do the right thing right you know you you're not finding a romantic like you know schedule three dinners with friends and ask them to invite over people who are looking for part sounds really simple right but um much as with the example of my friend who lost all this weight through behavioral change that the fear still lives within him very very strongly and so clearly there's some some stuff happening underneath there now fortunately he did lose the weight and he's kept most of it off but it's clear to me that until he addresses some of these other issues of sence and uh defense mechanism self-awareness Etc that um the fear he's still experiencing ing makes total sense because the foundation of that change is not nearly as strong as it could be um maybe right or maybe he doesn't have to have the fear but he's not going to learn either one without the exploration so he won't if there is risk he won't be able to avert the risk and if there's not risk he's then sort of laboring through life which is difficult enough without being worried about something you don't have to be worried about right so the process of inquiry will always make that better it's clear to me that his fear of regaining weight is absolutely sapping his enjoyment and his productivity in other domains of life so warrants attention right because because we're deciding in that sort of mathematical way like it doesn't have to be that way doesn't mean it can change overnight but it can be understood and it can be changed well it's for that reason and many other reasons that I'm very grateful that you explained these two pillars structure of self and function of self and how these flow up to uh empowerment and humility and how those flow up to agency and gratitude you've given us a a set of ideals and and and road map of of how to get there and one that we're going to continue with in a moment here um I did want to reiterate what you said which is that there is a pdf version of this this structure this road map of ideals and how to get there um that's been provided as a link in the show note captions um so people can refer to them there in visual form if they like if you're interested in understanding yourself and in having goodness in your life as much as you possibly can then you're interested in the structure of the mind and and this means that you're interested in the unconscious mind in all the things that go on a million things a second that we don't know or understand one by one but that we can explore and understand better in total we're also interested in the conscious mind in being self-aware we're interested in the array of defense mechanisms and whether or not they they're elegant and light passes clearly through them or whether they're distorting light and creating misperception right if you're interested in the structure of the mind then you're also interested in the character structure like what is your character structure what is the nest around all of it how do you interface with the world and then you're interested in the self that you grow from that phenomenologically meaning what is your experience of self how does it feel to you these are all important parts of this pillar of health and happiness the other pillar is the function of the mind and of course there's overlap there different cupboards but the cupboards all contain different ingredients that together make the recipe right so if we're interested in the function of the mind then we want to pay attention that there's an eye like we want to be self-aware and we want to cultivate self-awareness we're also interested in how those defense mechanisms work when they're in action right what's Salient inside of us and outside of us what are we paying attention to how are we behaving what are our strivings do we feel hopeful about ourselves and the world around us and if we're interested in all of these things we can't help but be respectful right of just how complicated this is like life is difficult and understanding ourselves is is difficult you know Wonderful Joy can come of living life but it is hard and it's hard day by day and trying to understand ourselves going to these places these pillars that hold the answers right they they can't but make in us a respect for all of it right and the respect for ourselves for others brings with it humil right when we come to this point of looking at ourselves and exploring then yes we become empowered right because we've gained a lot of knowledge right we're digging where the Pay Dirt is and we're figuring things out and along with that empowerment comes humility a respectfulness for how difficult all of this is how complicated we are how we can make happiness in our lives but how it certainly isn't easy and we take with us the empowerment and the humility and we express them right and if we're expressing empowerment and humility we come to living through agency and gratitude so here both are active words so agency it's it's easier to see right it's an active word where I'm aware of my ability to to project myself into the world around me I know that I can't control everything right but I'm really trying to understand what can I control right how can I control it what what do my decisions now lead to in the future so agency is very very active right gratitude is active too right because we're bringing an active sense of gratitude sense of the amazingness that we're here and and pride in ourselves and others for being here and and trying to move forward as best we can and then we bring that to our interactions we're much more likely to have a kind gesture towards others instead of being angry we're much more likely to have something compassion to say including to ourselves than we are to have something angry to say that gratitude accompanies agency they're they're active words and they're active together and if we're living life through agency and gratitude I mean there's a lot of wisdom about this there's a lot that's been written and researched about this and if you look at what is it telling us right remember things are getting simpler right as we're getting higher up the the levels here right the unconscious mind is most complicated now we're at hey can we live our lives with agency and gratitude at the Forefront and what does it bring for us and I think it brings what we are seeking that we might say okay we're seeking happiness and that can mean a lot of things you know a lot of different things it can be a very active thing am I happy in the moment and we can use happiness sometimes to distract ourselves like happiness is important but words when people really think like what is it that they want or what is it that they have right if if they're they're they're Overjoyed to be alive right they're finding a sense of Peace they're finding contentment they're finding Delight the ability to be delighted right this is what people want our our our human history and our our searchings tell us this and our own experiences tell us this and and now it could lead a person to think well okay what's going on I mean is is this someone who's you know levitating at the top of a mountain like is this just a state is this a state that people are in and and the answer is no it be sometimes we could be in that state where we can feel peace there's no tension inside of us right I could feel I have times when I don't feel tension inside of me there's contentment there's peace I don't have to drive towards anything right but it it's not the passive experience of it because we are living life it's that that feeling goes hand in hand with a drive within us that we're when we're in this healthy place we are living life the decisions that we're making what is putting the rubber to the road it is a generative Drive within us there is a drive to make things better to understand to explore and it's that drive that we access and cultivate and synonymous with happiness is it's not just the the state when people want to be happy in that very very general way yes contentment peace Delight right but but they're happening as we're living life right as we're enacting a generative Drive where we're looking at ourselves and the world around us and we're interested in understanding we're interested in making things better and that's the place that we're trying to get to I believe that with all my with all my heart and my and my brain right my education training experience and also experience living living life and and for 20 years doing this work with people tells me this is what we're seeking and it's an active way of of experiencing ourselves and our place in life I love that because it merges both the nouns and the adjectives and the verbs you know and and this notion of a generative drive to me is so compelling because um I have the sense and I hope I'm right that we all have some sort of generative Drive within us starting at an early stage um maybe it even starts as visual foraging or touching things with our hands as an infant and you know exploration of the world right is what brings about the changes in the neural circuitry that allow us to engage even more and in and in progressively on the one hand narrower ways but also with more richness and and more detail um could you tell us more about generative drive and and how this shows up in different types of people um is it always positive can there be too much of it um I certainly know a number of people who are addicted to work for those of you listening I'm raising my hand um but I would say nowadays I'm not as addicted to work as I once was in the sense that I derive far more satisfaction from less work now provided that the work is really indepth you know I think that there were years in in graduate school where I wanted to publish a bunch of papers and then quickly realized um through the not so gentle persuasion of my my mentors that like let's just do the best possible work we can do and there's so much more richness and and experience and things to be gained from that so I'm familiar with generative drive as as I understand it but maybe if you would if you could flush out a bit of what generative Drive is and and does it arrive um in parallel with or before we are able to access peace contentment and Delight um Can it even be separated out from that um now what what is this generative Drive yeah so drives are built into us so the the the synonymous with our existence like if we exist then then we have the drive I mean that that's how the drive is defined right and we understand going far back to to psychodynamic and psychoanalytic roots and and when people were really thinking hard about human beings and what's going on inside of us that we've sort of identified and then validated over the period of time since that we have aggressive drives within us and we have drives towards pleasure now this often gets misunderstood that so aggression can be uh it can be active violent aggression for example but aggression can also be sort of a sense of agency right the inaction of agency like I I want to do things I want to change things I want to I want to make the world a different place right that that all of that comes under this drive so so aggressive an aggressive drive is not a bad thing if we had no aggressive drives the thought is we just lie down and nothing else would happen and then we'd all be gone right so so there's a way in which this drive within us moves us forward right and of course it's extremely complicated the ways we can manifest too much of it or too little of it or how our defense mechanisms can intertwine with the drive but the drive is there it's like it's fuel within us that comes with our existence and then how that fuel moves us forward how much of it there is no that is determined by the meshing of the drive with how we're living life right and the same would be true of pleasure you know the pleasure Drive doesn't just mean like we all want to be hedonists right inside it means that we want things that are gratifying right we want to feel good right this isn't just you know the drive towards physical pleasure like a sex drive or or eating food or having Comfort like all of that can be part of it but it's a drive for Relief right the idea that we don't want to be white knuckling life right searching for pleasure so having aggression within us as we White Knuckle life and we search for some pleasure and and relief right these drives within us can be healthy they can be unhealthy you know they can be anything right they're they're they're Wells Springs within us that then fuel us forward and there's controversy to the idea of is there a generative drive and there's certainly at parts of the field that do not think so right but there have been strong thinkers in the field that have thought we do have a generative drive that it is within us to look around us to be be curious to be amazed right to think like how how can I engage with this and make this better or happier to think outside of ourselves right to think if I if if I feel good and you're in pain can I make you feel better right having nothing to do with me right the the idea of altruism coming to the four and having industriousness with us within us right and and the idea that there's a generative drive it it's strengthened when you look at how humans behave when you know we're not struggling right that that people are interested in learning you know you think about how how much of people give of themselves to learning right or to serving others like there's so much of this goodness in the world around us now if we shut people away right they have no you know imagine you know God forbid someone is in a solitary confinement from when they're the moment they're born you know then there there's not an opportunity for the generative drive to thrive right and we see so many so many situations where it doesn't Thrive enough right you know violence in people's surroundings lack of opportunities right that we can squelch a generative Drive anyone's generative drive but if we give ourselves opportunities if you know if we're healthy that we're not weighed down by trauma and illness and misperceptions of self and we can live life in a way that brings us to agency and gratitude now we're allying with the generative drive that I absolutely believe is within us I think just look at life look at human beings we observe that we have this drive within us and if that drive is at the Forefront and that drive then naturally of course allies with agency and gratitude then I think we're at the place that is the place we we ultimately seek right and that we can find it for brief periods of time so so by really pursuing this and and like really strongly in my own therapy and reflection and attempts to understand I can have periods of time where I can feel that way I I can feel outward growth and interest in the world and and I feel good I'm not trying to answer some question of like why am I alive or like I'm doing things that I feel good about and I feel good about doing those things and about being in the world and and I think this is not uncommon you know it may be far more common in societies that are allegedly less Advanced right that is have less distractions or maybe you know less uh knowledge of of all the awful things in the world that can happen to us that are constantly fed to us like there's there a whole bunch of other questions and topics about it but but this this you know I have this absolute belief that there's this generative Drive in us that wants to AE with agency and gratitude and that we all have it within us to bring those to the Forefront and to find that thing that we seek whether some this person says it's Nirvana the other person says it's Joy or happiness or peace or numbing you know whatever it is there's there's something to it where we're not feeling the tension within us we're not feeling the anxiety the pressures but we're feeling a sense of goodness the way you're describing it um makes perfect sense why peace contentment and Delight be so closely linked to this generative drive you know the the word peace as you alluded to is often um brings to mind the idea of of passivity but generative drive and the inclusion of things like aggression and a drive for pleasure are anything but passive uh so I think that's important uh for me and for everyone to understand that um Peace contentment and Delight can really be action terms again move moving them from uh you know from the more typical conception of them to to verb States so peace contentment and Delight are are not passive States I mean there can be periods of time where we can be just very peaceful and very much at rest but but those words are not synonymous with inaction right in fact they're synonymous with action a lot of the time right if we are suffused with peace contentment the ability to Delight then what we're doing is we're raising up the generative Drive we're making conditions that are permissive for the generative Drive dve to come to the Forefront right to be Paramount over the aggressive and the pleasure drives right and remember we're not trying to get rid of those drives right we just want the generative Drive in us to be at the Forefront then we'll be able to harness the aggressive drive through for example a strong sense of agency fueling the sense of agency forward as opposed to destructive aggression right the search for pleasure which sure can include physical Pleasures in in ways that are good and reasonable and healthy for us but also the pleasure of learning right the pleasure that altruism brings that we can take the aggressive drive that we know is in us and the pleasure drive that we know is in us and we can dial them to the right places like this gets very complicated and it's easy to dial that too far up and it's easy to dial it too far down right but if both are serving the generative drive because we lift up the generative drive and we bring it to Primacy by being able to handle Our Lives to understand ourselves to go back to those pillars and to build upon it the agency and the gratitude that then leads us to peace contentment and Delight we can put all of this together and like we're really and truly living in an active way in the world that's good for us good for the world around us and doesn't leave us with a sense of Yearning or sense of tension within us do you think it's also the case that generative drive has kind of a um self-amplification feature to it what comes to mind is your describing generative drive and its relationship to peace contentment and Delight is that approximately a half hour after I wake up I start to feel um more physically energized I'm not somebody who just pops out of bed and is ready to go exercise or do mental work um but about 30 minutes or so after waking my my mind starts to wake up and I've noticed that if I read a scientific paper or if I read a chapter in a book or if I um do something that feels a little bit difficult cognitively difficult in particular that um the sense of satisfaction that I get from that is immense and it it's not necessarily the case that I have to learn something that I'm going to use that day but for me learning and um and often learning and sharing what I learn uh with the world whether or not they want to hear it or not um is part of my uh pleasure Loop and um and I've learned that if I don't capture some new knowledge in a way that's challenging um in the morning time um I I feel like the gears are still turning but but I start to lose energy whereas if I find something interesting in particular and and I write it down and and I feel like I own it that's what I enjoy so much about learning it's like it's in there maybe it'll be useful at some point maybe it won't but it's like a it's like a animal finding a tool that it can maybe use to forge more more effectively later in life I I get such a sense of satisfaction that then I find that I have immense energy to do whatever is next like whether or not that's exercise or learn more or prepare a podcast or write a grant or um or work on a paper and this feature of my mental life has is so prominent that um I almost have to force myself to do it each day and there are so many distractions in the world nowadays that I've come to a place where I almost have to force myself to do what I know works for me um but when I do it it feels like a almost like a chemical Rocket Fuel and and it doesn't make me manic or crazy I don't need to pick up the phone and call somebody or tell everybody about it or post on social media it's more of a deep sense of satisfaction and and I get energy from it is that the generative Drive well it's great that that works for you what what you're saying is that that for you like you can prime your generative drive that way right and then you prime it you prime the pump it gets revved up right like and then and then you know it's it's really manifesting itself inside of you I mean there's many different manifestations of the generative drive as there are people right so some things are going to work for some person other things are going to work for a different person right but but but you're saying that hey I know this thing works for me and even though sometimes it's not easy to do I do it and then look what it gets for me right and that's that's really healthy right it's like knowing that this thing works for you and then you become committed to it because your generative Drive is is is really strongly supported by it right and then you have this sense of Good Feeling right so then you have you have the peace and you have the you just the overall sense of goodness right the you know peace and contentment and Delight you're getting that in learning and in teaching so so you you're figuring out like hey this works for me right and again you don't have to figure it out through this lens it's if we find parts that aren't working then we go back and we figure them out right maybe a good example maybe is um so let's say you take someone who who really enjoys gardening and gets something out of gardening right so there are as many generative drives and how they're measured out as there are humans but there can be common outcomes of them right so the enjoyment of of fostering plants growing a garden is like that's not uncommon in humans right so imagine someone who hasn't been doing that right they really want to they have a drive to do it there's a plot of land in the back that they used to cultivate right so if they're not doing it there any number of reasons maybe maybe they were depressed and they needed mental health treatment maybe they just got away from the path that they were on maybe their defenses shifted a little bit whatever the case may be they go back to the pillars and they figure it out right and now they're in accord with themselves right and they're living through agency and gratitude and they feel like right I can go back out there and I can till that land I can you know I can get the hoe out I can you know I can make the plots I'm going to put the seeds in I'm going to nurture like I can go do that and I can do it even what even though I was depressed even though somebody assaulted me five months ago you know even though I lost my job even though even though even though right they overcome the even those right and the sense of agency tells them right I can go do that right and the sense of gratitude no one who's miserable and and and now is you know is in such an awful position about life because they were attacked or lost their job or something bad happened whatever it may be or they're lost in cynicism there's no gratitude there right it's a gratitude for being in life for having the capability of going back and and you and planting seeds in that Garden that's the alliance between agency and gratitude and then the person goes and does that right so think of what's going on there they do this thing they feel good about this thing they can have they can look out at the Garden feel some peace right feel some contentment to them be delighted by what they did remember how much they loved it before how much it means to them so yes that goodness comes that goodness suffuses us and it raises up the generative drive that says right it's it's good we breathe some life into it right enough to get that Garden done now the generative Drive is further fostered forward by the goodness the person feels so so the example and the difference between the person who's like wants a garden feels terrible about themselves and they're not doing it and they feels lousy every time they look out the window and there they are looking out the window right the difference between that and having made a garden and looking out the window at it is a night and day difference and the the the person who's looking out the window with the garden that they built overcoming whatever was inside of them because they they went and addressed it and and prove to themselves that they could that's what we're after in life right it's we all know this it doesn't look like somebody levitating at the top of a mountain right that's what it looks like the person looking out the window at the Garden and thinking about what they overc overcame to create the garden and seeing the goodness of it all yeah I'm glad you said the word creating because it seems It's about creating things real tangible things but that the process to get there is every bit as important as what's created when you create knowledge that that's tangible right like you you you create knowledge maybe that that person looks down the row of beautiful flowers and has the same sense of goodness inside of them that you do when you're well like right I just I just went and learned something as you described that I I'm thinking I I certainly hope so because for me it's it's an incredible sense of satisfaction and and um one that I enjoy so much that I almost don't want to look at it too much cuz to me it it sits in this um uh rare domain of perfect like it's just it just feels so good and um and that I can get back there is very is very comforting to me right and that's all of this that it feels so good that's what all this is It's the generative drive right it's the it's the Gratitude right it's the contentment it's like all that coming together and it's interesting we could contrast that to to when you talked about a repeated cycle that's negative right then you're not feeling that right so so think about the learning that can come from it right that you you can you can achieve this and feel this and be in this state in one aspect of your life like what can you learn from that to bring to the other place and more yes that's important it's more it's often starting with what's going on in the place that's not doing well right like I said why the repetition right so this is how we we can have what we're seeking in parts of our Lives even if we don't in others but if we can have it in parts of our Lives we can have it in others too and we can become role models for ourselves we can learn from ourselves eles we can learn from what brings the good to how to raise up the things that about us in our lives that aren't there yet I often get the question H from the general public how can I stop overthinking you know I I have to imagine based on the fact I get that question so often that there are a great number of people who um sense their own generative Drive what are your thoughts on that thinking can be wonderful if we're using thinking to learn right to figure things out so when thinking is doing that thinking is great but a lot of thinking is just in the service of something else right and a lot of thinking works against us so imagine the person making the garden right at the person has to think about it they have to think about what seeds to make they have to think about where the the tools are they have to think about what they're doing when they're planting when they're watering there's a lot to do but the beauty of it isn't in the thinking right the thinking is in the service of what is generative right so so that's a different kind it's it's just thinking in the service of something but a lot of our thinking is that you know it's it's planning it's projecting we tend to glorify the planning and the projecting and and it can be great when we're learning when we're figuring things out but a lot of that is is there so that we can do the things that are good for us to do right the planning and the projecting around making the garden where the point of it is the garden it's not the thinking part right we can also use thinking against us so much thinking is repetitive and and not just not just unproductive but harmful right that person who's looking out the window at the Garden may be thinking I mean sometimes there just pauses in our thinking but you know a lot of times a person must be thinking and and what often goes on there is just repetitive negative thinking it's you know gosh I used to have a garden I remember when that was beautiful or know remember before such and such a person passed away and then we stopped making the Garden or I'll never be able to make a garden again or gosh it's too much you know it's just something that's negative and unproductive I mean what else is there to think if the person's actually looking at the window at the Garden right and they're in this sort of stuck state they're not in a generative State then the thinking becomes becomes repetitive and it furthers all the negative right as we said The more we further the negative the more we take if there's a four-lane Highway that we want to atrophy let's not make it into a six Lane Highway you know but but we do that when when we have this repetitive thinking which then can evolve into the narratives the things that we say to ourselves right so so you thinking is wonderful it's wonderful but it can also just subserve something else and it can also be used against us so what we're talking about here doesn't glorify thinking I mean it does if it's in the service of the generative drive but it doesn't in and of itself I think many people um set a time say you know 9:30 a.m. or 10: a.m. when they are going to begin doing something that they want to do or know they should do that's a little bit challenging could be exercise could be cognitively demanding work and then 10:00 rolls around they say Okay 10:15 and they're distracted by often social media texting these days I think those are the main culprits really um I don't know too many people that get distracted by exercise and reading books some do um and doing complex puzzles or math but um you know social media is a little bit like mental chewing gum except that I would add to that it's the kind of chewing gum that um really does um sate the appetite in a way that prevents you from eating nutritious food unless used correctly right um and then people feel bad about themselves because the whole morning went by now it's noon then they require some food like any typical person and they eat then they might KN a little nap for the Post prandial dip in energy and then the afternoon and and then it goes on and on I mean I I hear this all the time I've experienced this before so I'm I'm not immune to this myself that's why I try and capture that early wave of energy whatever it might be adrenaline noradrenaline uh some combination the way you describe thinking and its potential relationship to generative drive it seems to me it's so important that we capture those moments of um potential creation how however small the action might be to remind ourselves that we are capable of moving things from point A to point B because in the description I just gave of the person that lets the morning Escape there's there's really um no external barrier except these distractions put differently all the tools exist within most all of us to be able to create what we want to create at least to create something right I mean right um and yet many many people just don't fulfill that um that right that they were and that we've all been given right so let's think think about what's going on there so so the person says I'm going to exercise at 10:00 right now they push it back to 10:15 and they do something on social media they push it back to 10:30 it'll be okay I'll get it all in what they're doing is they're they're engaging in is unhealthy defense mechanisms right so if we go back to the the pillars right the the structure of self the function of self there may be other reasons for it but let's just identify the unhealthy defenses of avoidance and rationalization right and then there's no thinking going on about that right they're just unconscious processes and you kick it down you know you kick it down the clock 15 minutes right they not thinking about it thinking then is subserving something different right the thinking is subserving the avoidance if I'm going to go look on something read a couple things reply you know I'm thinking I'm planning right I got to get the maybe I got to get the phone out I got to tap you know my code into it I got to go to a certain website like we're doing something that we're thinking about it I think about what I'm going to write back but the thinking is all in the service of the unhealthy defenses right so then by understanding ourselves better we can we can bring that right to a healthier Place how by by actually using thinking for what helps us right so let's think of like what okay what's going let's say if you're doing that okay what's going on when you're doing that right so so do you you you really want to exercise right but like it's not easy to exercise and sometimes mightbe just problem solving are you doing a thing you like maybe something you like more there's lower barrier Etc but let's say we're just working within the psychological right then you can come at that a couple of ways like I don't want to do that thing that thing's hard right I mean I think that about things in my life sometimes and it always makes me H makes me weighty and unhappy right I may as well put 20 lb weights on either side of me right I mean I can look at it that way right or there's a different way of looking at it that actually fits much better which is like I'm not daunted by doing difficult things and I can get out there and and apply myself and you know and I feel good about that when I do difficult things it's like part of my identity right it's like part of how I see myself so right I'm going to go do this thing and I'm going to feel good about it and and isn't it amazing that I get to do it right like look here I am I'm alive I'm healthy right I can go do this thing my health is is good but I want to make it better right by working out or I'm at least alive and if I lose a little bit of weight I'll feel healthier like come on this is good right and then I'll feel different about that right and and like truth is one or the other it's like oh both can be true now what will be true is what you choose right and if you choose the negative then yes the unhealthy defense is perpetuated even if you get yourself to do it today it's harder to do it tomorrow tomorrow that's why sometimes I'll say to a person like just take a look at it and decide if you want to do it or not if you don't want to exercise just decide you don't right and then okay there's a trade-off for everything maybe you're okay with the trade-off right but what am I trying to do there right is is bring to Consciousness that that person is making a choice right do you want to do it if you want to do it if you want to do it it's great to just do it right and if you don't it's it's great to not do it at least you're being honest and clear with yourself and you're not wasting all that time when you keep kicking it 15 minutes down the you know down the clock you know until it's too late does does that make sense that's I think how the structure here really does it works because it's it's pulling together what we know from the biology to the psychology of like how to understand ourselves and how to understand when things aren't the way we want them to be so that we can make them the way we want them to be it's not magic it's it's following the sort of mathematical aspects of you know going to the factors assessing them making changes and and then of course we see the outcome we want to see the way you describe it does make sense and I I appreciate it because I think ultimately it seems to ratchet back to actions to verbs to bring us to these feeling states that you know I think are what people are seeking you know peace contentment Delight you know through agency gratitude as active terms right there yes you know I think these are Universal desires and again you're providing this um wonderful road map for people to arrive there thank you I do have a question about some of the underpinnings of generative Drive in particular this um notion of aggressive Drive um I've known people that seem to have a lot of this they just have a lot of get up and go or a lot of drive to create in the world or to figure things out um they often do create great lives for themselves in in work and relationship Etc I've also observe that these people often don't have the best relationship to themselves or that they run up against um barriers or L sometimes straight into brick walls um in certain domains of their life perhaps as a consequence of having too much of this generative or aggressive drive and at the same time I know that there are people in the world many that have of a what seems to be a low generative Drive I I don't know if that's the case or not but um that they um they seem to have a hard time engaging like in doing things and and often you get the impression that they somewhat are completely given up like they just like life is just too hard or um sometimes it's even more subtle like I know someone who they like their job but they've come to the place that um you know like it's just work like it's a paycheck and and that might be enough but they're always talking about it so I have to assume that it's not enough they aren't able to slot their work into one domain and and just focus on the other uh aspects of their life that are going well it doesn't compensate for them to think about the other aspects of their life that is so um is there a Continuum of generative drives that exist in us are these intrinsic I I realize there are near infinite number of conditions that um could give rise to one or the other could be hardwired could be nature could be nurture but what is the relationship between kind of um I want to say arousal or um the potential for arousal and aggressive drive and uh and these things that we're seeking yeah yeah so if it's okay I I'd like to start like the first principles of the drives right so the the theory of drives came about when when people were observing very closely like human beings and human behavior individuals uh societies cultures right and and identifying that hey that that you can boil a lot of things down to to a drive that we call aggressive right there's something to like impose myself out there on the world around me right it explains a lot of what people do right and then the the other identified Drive was pleasure right was you know so enjoyment even relief of unpleasantness right that that the those like you can describe a lot of human behavior and and that to understand like what's going on inside of us that means that we're here right you see that through the lens of aggressive and pleasure drives and like that's the answer to it to how we survive but I think that is not the answer to it that if it were just aggressive drives and pleasure drives there's not a value system around that like you know somebody who's very industrious can build or destroy right and we see this in historical figures like being very intelligent and very industriousness has nothing to do with whether you're building or destroying right so if it were just an aggressive drive and a pleasure drive then we wouldn't be having this conversation right because the species would have would not have survived right so if you believe that and I believe that then you look for something else you say maybe we looked and we found two things and there more things right and then we start thinking about learning for learning's sake altruism things that are not explained right unless there's a self-referential where you feel good doing something for someone else so therefore it's selfish like there's a lot of gyration around that if you really observe humans you do see altruis altruism you see learning for learning sake you see people being benign when everything about a situation would say that they could would or should under society's rules not be benign right and then we start to see that there is another drive that how do you explain that we're here yeah aggression pleasure and generativist or generative Drive the drive to make things better that's why we build more than we destroy we destroy a lot right but we build more than we destroy otherwise we wouldn't have clothes on our backs let alone have the the technology to sit here and to be able to do this so it's the generative drive that that is most realized in the healthy person right and the healthy person has the strong generative drive now as you said there are other factors and this is sort of what you were asking about they're probably their natural levels of aggression or pleasure seeking or generativist that differ across people right because we're a product of you know the complexity of our genetics and you know all the complexities of Nature and nurture so we're going to get to a place where where some of us have more some of us have less right the the the the conclusion though is for all of us the generative Drive being at the helm is what what leads us to be to to live good lives right to live to the things that we aspire to the peace and contentment right so we want the generative drive to Rule the Day right whether a person is studying Neuroscience or growing Garden right the importance is about being generative then then aggression and pleasure can subserve the generative drive right and then the question you're asking I I think which is well what if there's too much aggression too little aggression right or too much pleasure seeking too little pleasure seeking that's when we we can see problems right and the problems then lead us back to the pillars to figure out the problems so too much aggression ultimately becomes and right too much aggression means like I want I I want to impose myself on the on the world around me more than I can more than is reasonable more than I can do without impinging upon others right that what you end up doing is taking from others right too much aggression becomes destructive right maybe a person destroys tears something down right takes from others uh says that the the nasty comment when it wasn't necessary and now everyone feels bad right but there there's that too much aggression start it becomes Envy right and envy is destructive right the same thing with too much pleasure seeking if I say okay I want you know I want my fair share of pleasure and you know relief of distress and all that but if I start if I rely on that too much right we now instead of aggression eclipsing the generative drive now it's pleasure eclipsing the generative drive then I want more pleasure and more pleasure and more pleasure and how long before I want your pleasure right so so then it's not healthy right what it becomes is envious right right it becomes destructive because now then I become Covetous of your pleasure or if I can't get it but I could bring you down then I'll feel better about myself that's Envy right so too much aggression eclipsing the generative drive too much of the of pleasure seeking the pleasure Drive eclipsing the generative drive and we end up in places of envy and envy is destructive and now we're in trouble I've never thought before about the relationship between aggression pleasure and envy but as you're describing it I comes to mind the movie American Psycho where Christian Bale placs this um well basically an 80s Yuppy in you know working in finance in New York and um and for anyone that scen it it's a can only be described as a violent parody of of 80s yepy culture and it's it's me dark comedy as there's going to be yeah it's as dark a comedy as it could be and and don't let your young children watch it because it's very gruesome and has like very sexual and but the the the aggressive features within the character that Bale plays um are immediately apparent in the movie like you know violent aggression sexual aggression um seeking money seeking wealth all the time a narcissism too an obsession with like everything from his skincare routine to uh his eight pack abs and like it's it's ridiculous but um but also an interesting window into some milder forms of those features that still exist in many people today right um but the Envy component starts to reveal itself a little bit later into the movie where um the scene I recall is one around where someone hands him a business card and then you hear the narrative in his own mind about how much nicer that guy's business card is then his and how he hates him so much he ends up killing the guy in very violent and sadistic fashion that's aggression over generative right right and so and the whole movie is about um this one uh aspect of culture at that time's ability to impose their will on EV everyone at their whim you know basically Bale just does whatever the hell he wants at any point goes returns videotapes in between and you know and there's so much woven into it and uh that is relevant and so much that's woven into it that's just purely for people's kind of sick entertainment um uh but that I believe it was Brett Brent East Ellis that wrote that and you know is tapping into the the aggression component pleasure component but the Envy component is really what resonates as as you come to the end of the movie is like there's no satisfying this guy he could kill or or sleep with as many people as he wants in the movie um and he can have as much wealth as he wants he can have entire buildings in fact I think he's living in an entire building at some point he takes over people's Apartments after he kills them it's it's it's wild and disgusting um but it really speaks to the extent to which Envy is woven into absolutely aggression and pleasure seeking and it's not something something that had really sunk in for me until you describe it now um because I think for most people they imagine okay when somebody has X number of millions or billions of dollars that they'll reach this place of Peace contentment and Delight right they'll have enough um and in the movie Wall Street there's that one scene where someone says you know what's your number like at what point is it enough and the guy says more that says all sorts of things about the dopaminergic system of reward systems in the brain Etc but I think it says is a lot more about Envy absolutely and just what in what a a pit of despair Envy is for everybody involved right right look Envy may not be the root of all evil but Envy plus natural disasters may be so much evil and destruction arises from envy and it may be that it's at the root of all of it and we so underappreciate that right we so underappreciate why people are destructive right which is why the roots aren't always in trauma but but a significant uh uh aspect of of where Envy arises from can often be trauma creating a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability but but wherever a person may come by it and it's a larger discussion of envy and where it may come from is it drives destruction and if the aggressive Drive is greater than the generative drive or if the pleasure Drive is greater than the the generative drive or if both are greater than the generative drive it will drive destruction and that destruction the vast majority of times if you look deep enough you find at its roots envy that Envy may arise from guilt and shame within the person but as soon as it becomes about another right I feel guilt and shame and inadequacy inside of me but then I feel Envy of those around me it drives the vast majority of Destruction do you think that's what's happening when we see these um sadly um ever more frequent examples of um active Shooters and school shootings things of that sort yes there other there are other people who have life right and that person doesn't feel that they do so they want to go and take it away from them and that's why as long as we have human tribulation and a lot of guns this it's going to happen it's it's a it's a logical conclusion of enough people being in places of Despair and how Envy can be cultivated within us and then ultimately how it blinds people it creates such a desire for Destruction that then people will take life away from others and often people sometimes take their own life which which I think really brings to the Forefront like that that that person doesn't feel that they have a life certainly not a life worth preserving so they're then going to take the lives of others and I think we're seeing that is as Stark um a portrait of where Envy can lead I think as we can find on a one person basis we we can go we can look at Wars and their destruction on a societal basis but I think that's that's the ultimate in understanding where and we can drive a person what about the other end of the spectrum when aggression and pleasure seeking are too low the other side of the spectrum is demoralization right so just imagine very very low aggression so low self- assertion low agency like the there comes a place where that the person is not then imposing themselves or believing that they can in in in much of any way on the outside world and that creates a sense of isolation understandably right a sense of powerlessness and vulnerability and isolation and that then becomes demoralizing which is not the same as depression I mean you know we know depression is it is there's a neurochemical imbalance right whether that imbalance came purely biologically or or came psychologically or because of external events there's a neurochemical imbalance you know here we're not talking about an illness State as identified by modern Psychiatry there's not a number in the in the book of diagnoses that goes along with with being demoralized right but why because it's a state that humans can be in and too low of an aggressive drive right and all the things that come of that it's isolating and it's demoralizing the same with too low of a of a pleasure drive so an example that maybe relatable is um to some people is you know knowing someone who who has had a couple of really bad breakups and and then says I'm not you know what I'm done with that there's no more Romance I'm going to be single right and and you know like that person has a drive in them like you know they're an interconnected person like they they want romance they these are things that are important to them but they they make a decision I'm I'm not have that in my in my life what what would be called in some psychodynamic sense is inviting death into life a little bit of death by by swearing off something that that the person has a drive towards right the pleasure Drive of companionship and of romance right that that then becomes demoralizing as well so sure those things demoralization can predispose to depression but demoralization is a thing in and of itself where then there's a sense of hopelessness there's a sense of you know the the goodness then is in accessible anymore and that's the other side of Envy can low levels of aggression and the resulting demoralization be coupled with high levels of pleasure seeking so I'm thinking about the person that um you know is like very overweight clearly um headed for health issues if they don't already have them and you know perhaps would like to remove that weight would like to feel more vigorous doesn't want type two diabetes and an early death but at some level they've given up because the the pleasure of eating is something they really enjoy they they really love it and yet it has a component to it in their life where they either self sooe with it or they're just trying to hit Baseline levels of satisfaction with it and and um they allow themselves to effectively be sedentary and and then the other sorts of trouble start to show up you know sleep apnea from carrying excessive weight and then feeling tired during the day and then who can exercise when they're too tired when you got to work and maintain other life demands and you can kind of see where this could rise and and makes perfect sense um you can also see where um if there were just a little bit more aggression it could all be turned around but they don't have it so is the scenario describ something that you've seen clinically I certainly observe it in my non-clinical stance out there in the world a lot right well I think the the most important thing you're pointing out is that aggression and pleasure on the high end right we we know can Trump the generative drive right but that this can also happen on the low end right so you're describing a situation this it's a great example right because it's not uncommon in the world around us so the aggression meaning the fuel to put oneself out there in the world right to utilize the sense of agency right so this is going to be a person who's low agency right the aggressive drive has has little fuel then to give the sense of agency its further squelch by neg by you know negative sense of self and negative selft talk now you find where the the aggressive Drive is is too low and too low can also Trump the generative drive right because then that person can't take care of themselves a generative drive would say there's a lot of Life to Live and there can be great things in life and take better care of yourself and by the way they're like people that you love and people that love you or or if not you know there's an animal or a garden you love right so so the generative Drive is saying that right but it's not winning the day because the the aggression or you know aggression is one word we could put to that drive you could call it an assertion drive you know we call it an agency drive but that's you know we're using agency in a different way but that thing is too low so it wins out over the generative drive and then in the example you gave it's not surprising that the pleasure Drive goes the other way maybe there's a predisposition to that genetically maybe it's just reinforced because a person in that place could say well think of what what this the the self-conception would be right I'm in this terrible place um it you know means I'm a terrible person I can't make myself better or I'm not good enough to get better no one cares about me I can't make anything right so so therefore like I don't I don't matter there's no reason to take care of myself so why would I not do if I eat that one thing that I enjoy and it gives me pleasure even it gives me pleasure for 2 minutes then I'll eat another one like in a sense so what well cuz I'm I don't feel that I'm worth preserving or that I can preserve myself right there's a nihilism to it that then kind of makes it make sense to overindulge the pleasure Drive whether it's a whether it's biologically predisposed or one is just arriving there but the the reason all that is bad is because the aggressive Drive is too low and in fact it's low enough that it's outweighing the generative drive then the pleasure Drive is going to come into you know one place or another if it's also really low the person does not much of anything and wastes away which tragically happens a lot in our society right or if the pleasure Drive is high maybe that person overindulges in things it provide short-term gratification and then that causes a different set of problems but but what's deterministic there is whether whether aggression or assertion again we could put different words to that drive but what we've been calling the aggressive drive and the pleasure Drive are they is one or the other or both high enough to Trump the generative drive or low enough to Trump the generative drive and and I think all problems that we see like everything fits into this model because it honors what we know right it honors what we know about human behavior and insights into human behavior over hundreds of years right over thousands of years right the wisdom that re brings forward and it it honors the science and that's why it fits together because I think it honors who we are as what our species is what we are um and you know what it's like what life is like as as we try and engage with it yeah I've seen cases of demoralized people where uh they simply you know disappear they they hide they isolate they slow down they take terrible care of their health and um you know sadly I've known uh several people like this in my lifetime uh one of whom killed himself the the other who um just has an immense number of health problems related to overeating and um inactivity and and knows it and talks about it and and but nothing seems to change despite multiple interventions from a caring standpoint from Friends Etc I've also seen examples of people who are demoralized who um seem to band with other demoralized people sort of um try to recalibrate the standard that they feel um oppresses them you know that they and this isn't necessarily just in the realm of of physical fitness this is also in the realm of like School demands I I went to a very demanding High School as I've talked about before on a couple of podcasts I barely finished high school I was not an attentive student I was my um aggressive and pleasure drives went into non-academic Endeavors and I regret that you know I I had so much making up of of of learning to do by the time I you know fortunately got to college uh eventually caught up but um my experience of high school was that there were these you know kids scoring perfectly on the SAT and the early admission to Harvard and early admission to Yale and all these places and then there was you know a distribution in the middle and then there was a collection of of kids who were not doing well knew they weren't doing well and kind of banded together around the idea of not doing well I I I didn't consider myself part of that group because I I frankly wasn't there that often and and um I was focused on other things as I mentioned but but what came of that group was actually quite tragic not just for them but for a l lot of other people they uh eventually engaged it it wasn't a school shooting type scenario but they eventually you know set off explosives in the on the school campus this was after they had graduated um I don't know where they are nowadays but things did not go well for them and they um exerted a lot of uh destruction to other people around them but before they did that there was this kind of banding together around their the fact that they didn't fit in that they and they weren't bullied as I recall that I could be wrong about this but I've seen this in other forms too like you know if you can't meet the standard band up with other people and change the standard and then you don't feel as demoralized perhaps um I can understand I can rationalize why this would be a reasonable approach but um I'm seeing this more and more um I'm also seeing by the way you know the other end of the spectrum people are overly aggressive and pleasure seeking and and things of that sort but but for the for the moment I'd like um your thoughts on you know how demoralization can split off into different Expressions depending on how um people feel and who else they're relating to yeah yeah well I think the place I would start is to say our society rushes headlong forward in a way that causes our society to trample people who are vulnerable and vulnerable people are demoralized people demoralized people are vulnerable people people and our society often tramples them and then they're not here with us any longer and that is tragic but at times they don't get trampled they get cast aside right they they they're injured right and cast aside and from that place tragic things happen right people then stay isolated you know I I think it's a tragedy that we don't all band together and go door Todo right to like seek people who who aren't coming out of doors right you know in the sense of like we let people be so so isolated and and often times that's that's the tragic end of someone's story right um but sometimes people do engage right they're demoralized but they can engage in in ways that involve an an affiliative defense so sometimes people who are demoralized can affiliate they can band together in in ways as I think you were alluding to that can that can make things better so if people are demoralized because say they're uh a group in society that that is chronically very mistreated right then it can be very powerful to band together both because there's what's called an affiliative defense that if I feel bad about myself about something and I'm alone it's highly likely I'm going to continue feeling bad about myself about that thing right but if you feel bad about yourself about the same thing and then we're together right we help each other feel better we don't feel so lonely we don't alone we don't feel so isolated we don't feel so ashamed right so an affiliative defense can help people to to say wait a second like I'm not there's nothing wrong with me and I'm not gonna take this line down or something right and then and to make assertions that create better rights in the world around us so so like very good things can happen from from affiliation in the context of demoralization but very bad things can happen too right because people can also affiliate around things that are very destructive I mean if I am hateful of society and I would like to be destructive and I'm alone okay I could do destructive things alone but if I band together with a couple other people who feel that way now I'm empowered to feel that way right instead of maybe I feel that way and or or there's racism or Prejudice and I don't feel like I I can say that right but then when it's permissive right because other people are are in the same place then people can accentuate the the hatred within you know within them so affiliation is very very powerful and part of society rushing so headlong forward and either trampling or marginal izing people is that we then don't pay attention or not enough attention to what happens with the affiliative groups right how do you guide people towards towards being able to affiliate in ways that are productive how do you give them routes of being productive right how do you try and protect against the ways that affiliation can lead to destructive Behavior so I think you know a lot of this is these are the natural things that happen within us but a lot of what we're talking about now gets impacted a lot by societ and societal standards which we of course altogether you know determine right and arise from us but they they start to sort of transcend because it's now people interacting with a whole social system going back to the other end of the spectrum excess aggression uh in particular uh I was in a conversation with somebody recently very successful like Beyond most people's comprehension of success financially successful and um seems to just have you know checked off their their goals one one box at a time you know from from go um but who described his um underlying psychology and emotional state as um one in which much of what he does on a day-to-day basis is driven by aggression in fact he he uh volunteered an anecdote about the fact that um he hates early morning meetings on Zoom but he shows up to them as sort of a uh like an Fu toward somebody that might not even be on the meeting right and um and so there's a friction point for him that allows him to engage in a way that he wouldn't otherwise be able to engage and he he channels that towards productivity and clearly it's worked for him um you know I don't know if he's done the sort of introspective uh Deep dive I imagine no through the structure of self and function of self but you know what are we to make of of that sort of example I mean I I I like the idea that if someone has a strong aggressive drive that they would Channel it toward good I mean I have no reason to think this person is doing anything but good in the world for themselves and others they're certainly not harming anyone at least not to my to my knowledge but that seems like a rough place to live for me it seems like a rough place to live and at the same time I'll offer a very brief anecdote that you know at one point in my career namely when I was a postto I was in a position by virtue of having left a laboratory and the nature of the field at the time where the work I wanted to do was directly pitted against the work of another very powerful laboratory except that I was a lone postto working in a laboratory essentially on my own on this problem and I remember going to my postto adviser the late Ben Baris and saying you know I think it might just move to a different problem because I don't really want to go up against this Goliath and he said uh you know the this is the best you know I can capture Ben's voice he said absolutely not like there's no way you love this stuff you have to do it because you love it and he kept telling me how much I love it and he reminded me that indeed I did love the questions and once I was able to tap back into the love for and the Curiosity around the questions I was able to push aside the the concerns enough that we did well um in publishing certain papers they did well but those 5 years frankly were a lot less pleasureful than they could have been I think because much of the script in my head was that I was in friction with this like you know at least in my mind this oppressive force it was it was purely competitive and I truly believe that we can't be at in our most creative state when we are competing with someone else by definition because then you're you're you're creating against a standard as opposed to Raw Creation right so um in both cases a lot of aggressive Drive frankly I I I have some of that and I had that um but desire for Revenge a a component of friction mixed in you know or integrated with this aggressive drive like this picture like even as I describe it is you know causing the release of a little little bit of adrenaline it's it's not a comfortable State it's not it it can't be a state of Happiness right so as you said people can do good in the world they can do not good in the world like we're not making a value judgment about what the person is doing because that's not what the question is about right like how are they feeling how are they doing right what's going on inside of them right and that can't be happy right that can't be happy because if if if you're built to be pretty good at competition right so you you can size up what are the factors you know you can strategize right so a person is built to be really good at competition then you know it sounds pretty good to make everything a competition right because you have the highest winning percentage right and but that's that's good to achieve some end right that doesn't have any feeling intrinsically associated with it right and if all you're doing is a series of competitions then what you're doing then is winning right and like winning is something like you know winning is like I won I beat you what whatever that is like that that can be part of happiness but it doesn't have to be right that that's not happiness right so so yes that kind of I'm I'm really built to compete well and I'm going to just see a series of competitions in front of me that's for for expedient forward prog ress right that's very effective but again expedient forward progress is is nothing to do with peace contentment Delight like it's it's it's not you know it doesn't have anything to do with that nor does have anything to do with doing good or bad right and I think the example you gave in your own in your career is like it's such a good example right because you know if you think about it when the way that you were sort of framing it inside is like there's a question I'm asking there's a question they're asking right and there's a competition right again it has to be two two to compete right so so there's almost an automaticity right that like they're studying the same thing maybe you know they feel competitive or certain people there too they were were in our definitely competitive they know who they are they're extremely compe and very successful right okay so then so then you okay I'm in a competition now again but you never decided to be in a competition right but but automatically I mean it's interesting right to understand you're acting as if you're in a competition you go I don't want this competition right because like they're bigger than me it's going to be unpleasant it's going to take you away from really thinking about what you want to do right it's going to make it harder to do a good to do the job you want to do right because now you're embroiled in you know something that's you know that has aggression behind it right so so you choose no I don't I I choose not to do that right and then Ben Baris reframes it to the truth and says well this this isn't this is not a compet I because you're not choosing to compete right because Ben pointed out what was important to you was the questions right so it's like almost as if Ben reminded you no no no no this is not through the aggressive Drive look at it through the generative drive that's what wins out in you right and then you go and apply yourself to it yeah and bless him for doing it because uh from that point forward I I've made it my um firm mission to always do things from a place of what I always think about as Delight you know curiosity Delight that the things that give me energy and that give me more energy from doing them um it wasn't a coincidence I believe that in those five years when I was operating from a mix of generative drive and the the competition would then resurface and you know I I couldn't hold hold it constant that um I was absolutely exhausted by the end of that phase I just in a way that um sucked a lot of the pleasure out of it I still drive some pleasure but then as I mentioned fortunately I was able to U pivot back to doing things out of love you know and and and getting back to uh peace contentment and especially Delight right you know right and I absolutely make a value judgment about that right that what you did is better right so what if you did what if you were different so think about if we talk about it through this accurate lens what if you were different at that time and the aggressive Drive in you was greater than the generative driving you right which would be an unhealthy state to be in but let's say you were in that unhealthy State then you probably would have still done what you did but you would have done it through the lens of aggression like I'm going to get them right now you're competitive with them there's there's anger in you there's you know there there's aggression right that you're you're enacting in fantasy as you're you know you're thinking about them and how you're going to win like all sorts of things go on inside of us and I would say there's no way on Earth you could have done the science as well as you did right it couldn't be because all that stuff is distracting right it's you know that kind of negative affect pulls for energy and time from you and also what seeds would you have planted in the the microcosm that you operating right more more competition right more competitiveness more Badness right so let's look at what you did do right because you're healthy or this particular question about this particular thing we know for sure because your generative Drive eclipses the aggressive drive then you set yourself to the work in a way that's going to be more effective right your brain isn't clouded you're not wasting energy you know plotting some revenge or plotting what you're going to do if they come take something from your lab I mean whatever it is you know like you're not living in any of that so you're going to do a better job at what you're what's so important to you to do and what seeds are you sewing then right you're sewing seeds of collaboration right and even then if someone could say well what does even that matter right say no it does matter because what you're doing then we just follow forward the math of it right is is contributing to understanding that's contributing to human health right and the better understanding we have of human health the more people stay alive and the more people stay healthy which could mean any one of us just like any one of us could be the vulnerable person that Society tramples or casts aside we all have it in us to be that or have been that at stages of our lives right we also all have it in us to be the opposite of that right we have it in us to be generative we have it in us to make good we have it in us to contribute to health to survival and that I place a value judgment upon it's why doing good is better than doing bad why creating is better than destroying and why ultimately it's the generative drive that has to Trump the other drives and when it does we're happy we're healthy we make the world a better place we Ally with and are suffused with the Gratitude and agency in us are fully active and we're suffused with peace contentment Delight as you said that's the place to be from that place we get this thing that we want and we help to make the world a better place which helps us to keep the thing we want it sounds so simple because as you pointed out the manifestations of looking at the right things and doing the right things are so simple yes right it's it's a list really and again we have a PDF that includes this list and and the the structure of of the pillars and how they flow up to this list but ultimately it's peace contentment and Delight you know underg guarded by agency and gratitude as active terms I mean very simple at some level um and yet for many people including myself at certain times in life the the um excess or or lack of aggressive drive or excess or lack of pleasure Drive can interfere with people's ability to access these these simple but um incredibly powerful um being States right because it's nature and nurture right so you might be built with a a greater or lesser natural amount of one drive than I am right but then we've had life experience that creates a Delta around that right so so you say okay we're built with different amounts of all these drives yes yes we are right but we also have control right through our decisions through how we handle Our Lives to modulate them right so that makes sense because the thought could be well the drive is what the drive is and it varies across people no there's a range the drive is in and that range can be very broad people can do all sorts of things to cultivate to cultivate the better we all can right so if we look at it as an unlimited upside right then what we what we see is I want to know where they at in me now right what's going on inside of me what are all those other factors right because I want to cultivate the good I want to cultivate that generative drive and I want to make sure the aggression and the pleasure aren't out of balance one way or another like we can actively look at that and manage it and I think that's like so what we're striving for because there's nothing here that we don't have some control over right and the higher we get up right the simpler it gets the more we have control over it and for people who feel like the the ideals that we're providing a road map toward are not accessible for whatever reason maybe they're feeling a little bit or a lot demoralized uh overly aggressive and not ending up where they want to go or ending up where they want to go and not experiencing deep satisfaction peace contentment and Delight where should they look in this framework that includes these pillars at the Deep levels of structure of self function of self that you know um give rise to empowerment humility agenty gratitude peace contentment Delight you know if someone should find themselves unmotivated or or stuck you know metaphorically speaking staring out the window into the garden that could be and that they want so very much but that they're not creating again that should translate to whatever domain of life you're you're seeking or not even in touch with what you really want you know infinitely confused about what to do in relationship school work life you know and and thinking about all the oppressive forces in the world like the political Chasm and the you know pandemics and lockdowns and like and all the stuff and all the the things that are weighing down on us what should that person in other words what should we all do at that moment you know stop and what each pillar has five cupboards look in all five and follow the clues that you find there that's the answer so go back to structure of self function of self ask questions about and engage in practices that bring about more self-awareness practices that um draw our attention to what's Salient for for us ask ourselves you know what am I thinking about internally what is my internal script what what am I focusing on externally you know am I spending all day on Twitter looking at accounts that I know I hate because it activates something in me etc etc I might have revealed something about myself that I'm just kidding that's not my my behavior but I see a lot of other people doing it what are my behavioral choices you know um what could bring about more hopefulness and and strivings I have that right right and there's right and there's so much of this that say one could do on one's own right because we can think about ourselves and we can learn things if we say well I don't really know that much about defense mechanisms okay like we could read about it right like we can do a lot of this on our own and we can get so much from talking to other people you know people in our Lives who are close to us who love us right we can talk with them about what's going on inside of us right and that is such an amazing mechanism of learning and they're also Professional Resources I mean like the good therapy should Encompass like this should be what it's doing right it might come out through one lens or another lens and you know CU every everybody's different and we can bring different modalities but ultimately that's what good therapy is doing right it's looking in all 10 of those cupboards and it's seeing where is the issue let's follow the clues like it's a spirited inquiry right whether we're doing it on our own or we're doing it with other people in our personal lives or we're doing it with someone professionally it's a spirited inquiry to follow the clues because if we follow the clues there are answers right and if we have the answers then we can bring things into better alignment and then we're in a better place those pillars are more stable and we can build on top of them what we want to build on top of them and the drives come better into line that that we can do that and it can be an iterative process of you know if if we we attain some better state of mind and like life is better and like we're happy like this happens to people there's a lot of contentment and peace and if things are going well and now something isn't as much go back and look again right it's it's a process we can use over and over because it works because it fits with the truths and the reality is as we have understood learned them you know our education the you know this a learning about humans that across hundreds of years tells us this it makes very good sense to me in the way that you have mapped it out for us um so much sense in fact that um I'm just struck by how Divergent it is from what I think most people think of when they think of therapy or the some of the risks of going to a psychiatrist um which I think it's only fair to consider in particular the way that um at least from my outside non-clinical understanding um these sorts of situations of high levels of demoralization or excessive aggression or just people not being in the place or being able to exert their their um their actions in the world the way they want want or not get the results they want is they'll start asking questions like um you know maybe I have a chemical imbalance or or maybe they'll go to a clinician maybe a cognitive behavioral therapist or um or psychiatrist and more often than not it seems they'll get you know prescription for X number of milligrams of some serotonergic Agonist or uh dopaminergic Agonist and of course as a neurobiologist I I you know I applaud the exploration of underlying brain organisms and the involvement of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin but what you're describing today is is very different I I think then um what most people are can expect if they go to the typical psychiatrist or typical uh psychologist which is part of the reason we're having this conversation but um I'd love your thoughts on that um and I don't want to make this about me uh I only offer this anecdote as um a way to round out a little bit of the earlier discussion uh I'll I've never shared this publicly but when I was a postto and going through that very hard phase of comp competition that I didn't want and having a hard time staying in touch with that and there were some other developmental things starting to resurface just by virtue of moving back to the town I grew up in ETC there I recall getting to the stairway of the building I was working in at the time which is the same one where my laboratory exists now actually and realizing I I couldn't go up the stairway I've always been reasonably fit um and just being so EX exhausted and then driving home that day on 280 and thinking you know like none of this matters like what am I doing like none of it matters I could have been exhausted I don't know what it was but what that ultimately resulted in was me talking to a psychiatrist who gave me a low dose of a of a um of a serotonergic anti-depressant I took that low dose of serotonergic anti-depressant I don't recall which one it was maybe it was sat talopram would that make sense and um spent that evening staring at my plate of Thai noodles for about two hours it hit me really hard and and I hated that feeling and then just stopped taking the drug um now I'm not this is no knock on satal pram or the use of serotonergic agents in the proper context they've saved lives so the the problematic too but I just you know that wasn't the route that eventually got me out of it it was it was mainly talk therapy and and self-care um but uh I just offer that because I you know I even as a neurobiologist I perhaps especially as a neurobiologist I thought okay here's the solution right it's going to shift some internal modulatory system and I'm going to feel okay about the situation I'm in and thank goodness it didn't work even for a short while because um the while I didn't do all the things that you're describing here of exploring the function of self because no one has ever laid this out for me I um I took the route of of talk therapy which I I find immensely beneficial um takes time but immensely beneficial um so what are your thoughts on the current strategies for diagnosis where those succeed where they fall short and and the role of medication in navigating this you know simple and yet complex landscape right we are so dramatically over reductionist you know it's almost to the point of unbelievable right I mean think about getting a medicine getting some say calop pram because of what happened right it can't possibly work right now maybe a judiciously chosen medicine could provide a little more distress tolerance and you could sort of think about it more and you could find your way through it but clearly it was an issue of self right like you're in a situation that was high stress and are you going to have to have this competition or not is it going to be good for you and you know you don't want that but can you avoid it like there's something going on that makes you not be able to walk up those stairs right so so again I'm not criticizing got with the person what kind of conversations you had about it with the person but the idea that a pill will fix that is like that's insane right now medicines can help smooth the way so so let's say you you initially went and the first time you see someone they say okay we have to talk about this right like what's going on in your life and you know because normally you can walk upstairs and go to work right why can't you now like we we need to think about that we need to talk about that let's say you start doing that and you're having a lot of trouble with it uh or you're just having really high levels of anxiety we might say look a medicine can kind of take the temperature down a little bit you know give you a little more distress tolerance and then you know we can you can think about it better inside of you and we can talk about it better but it's medicine in the service of understanding now sometimes medicines are doing things like medicines that can help prevent bipolar episodes right like they're doing something that is purely biological but we use so many medicines for things that are not biological they're psychological but we we're so over reductionist that we could actually over reduce the problem that you said right like a clear wow that's fascinating right like how many times have you gone up those stairs and now you can't it's so interesting the idea of like let's just give you a pill I mean it it really makes no sense but if we're over reductionist enough you could see how that's the logical Endo of an illogical process right and I'll give you another example and this is really it's a true story of uh a woman who young woman comes into the emergency room and she says she can't sleep and you know she looks anxious and she feels very very anxious uh you know by her description and that's why she can't sleep and and she gets a sleeping medicine and she goes home and then she comes back she comes back a couple days later and she's very very anxious and she can't sleep and she looks like she did before like nothing seems to be different and she hasn't gotten any sleep at all so the doctor in charge gives her a higher dose of the sleeping medicine then she goes home and then she comes back yet again and nothing is any different she's still not sleeping she's still anxious and then the doctor concludes that she's drug seeking because she wants more and more of the sleeping medicine okay what was actually going on was she was getting hurt at home she was terrified to go home of course she couldn't sleep right like bad things were happening right but no one asked the question right they thought she cannot sleep we'll give sleeping medicine right instead of asking why right and then she gets home sent home and when the medicine doesn't work well now there's something wrong with her right and if you put that label on her now she's drug seeking right then she's not going to get any help right so I'm not against medicines I mean I I use psychopharmacology as part of my practice and I think from a from a biologically based perspective about many things but we have to know what something is the answer for and what something is not the answer for and in the in the overly reductionist world of throughput in in Health Care Systems people are even being trained these days that don't know any different right I'm trying to be overly critical of practitioners because often practitioners are working in impossible situations where the goal is through throughput and that's more efficient in the short term right it's more efficient today right but it's of course not good in anything but the today term and it's interesting because it's never good for the person even today it's like never good for the people in it right but but often these decisions are being made based upon business and money and I I understand business and money I I'm a capitalist I'm interested in these things but the way that we have let things get the business and money with a shortsighted short-term perspective than bonds with the over reductionist ways that we approach medicine and then we have these bizarre things happen and these kind of bizarre things end lives right it change the courses of lives like fortunately you you know you got you got what you needed and you figured things out but if you hadn't would you have the career you have like we don't know right or if if someone else hadn't realized like let's talk to that woman and see what's going on you know would would she have survived I mean we don't we don't know but the point of that is like lots of bad things happen right there we're rolling the dice too many times with too many people and it doesn't have to be that way and the way that we're doing it now is not only inefficient financi right the thing that we seem to be caring about most it it leads to bad outcomes and it also makes no sense right we're looking at it through this sort of bizarre lens then we may find within us the strength to change that and to change it in a way that actually fits the science and fits the common sense now I have to imagine that both for people who require medication in order to cope um in order to manage their way through these questions about function of self and how they are in the world what they're paying attention to Etc and for people who don't require medication to do this exploration that this very same exploration is the road map to feeling yes agency gratitude peace contentment and Delight medicines may have a role so if for example we go look at the pillars and things are not going so well and and you see that whenever that person has a bipolar manic episode while things get really really damaged and like it's very very hard they can't recover from that in the ways they want to then we'd say well let's we're going to use medicine to help this right now of course there are other things too use behavioral changes for example right but there but there's a clear biological role just like we use medicine to stop seizures right but people also have to make sure they're not super sleep deprived there's another part to it too we can use medicine to prevent bipolar episodes but there's another part of self-care involved too but it's it's a role of medicine right just as if anxiety levels aren't coming down too much say for the person to get at the trauma right they know there's a trauma they've talked around it you know for 20 years they know it's been impacting them they're not sure how it's hard to go there they're with a trusted therapist but it's still it's hard to put words to it and now you know they're maybe having a panic attack right you think okay let's we can use medicines to take the temperature down to to sort of e you ease that person's Way Forward so that they can understand something right that then provides a resolution in that part of the pillar and then you know things are set in a better place so so so the biological aspect you know and specifically here we're talking about medicines has its place but the idea that medicines are a substitute for understanding this makes no sense well you've provided us an incredible framework thank you you know this framework really speaks to all of us right you know the components that make us who we are you know that as you put it the structure of the self you know everything from the unconscious mind conscious mind defense mechanisms character structure self and the functions of self you know these components of self-awareness defense mechanisms reaching up from that Iceberg under the water what we pay attention to our behaviors and hopefully our strivings and sense of hope and how those two pillars flow up into empowerment humility agency and gratitude again as action terms as active terms and eventually to peace contentment and Delight in this notion of generative drive as well as some of the pitfalls and and um challenges that can pull down on generative drive or Aude generative drive and you very clearly pointed us to where we should all look in terms of understanding ourselves better and where we could do better and be better in the world because this is a series we have the wonderful opportunity to um have you tell us even more about how this structure plays out both in terms of its health healthy expression and in terms of its unhealthy expression you know in different pathologic conditions that you know most of us are familiar with at least in name and and I'm sure you're going to tell us more about you know what the what the real um both underpinnings and expressions of things like narcissism in you know extreme and Mild form um you know anxiety in its extreme and Mild forms um and and also some of the uh the names and diagnosis that we're more familiar with hearing uh about such as you know bipolar disorder obsessive compulsive things of that sort um but that all relate back to and and really are nested in the this structure and function of self and where it can all go so um first of all I want to say an thank you really an immense thank you for for oh you're so welcome for defining the structure and making it so clear to to me and to everybody else and and as you said it it has its complexity there's in fact immense complexity down there at the bottom but that flows up from complex to to very simple ideals and a ro map to get there and again the PDF is available to people as as a link in the show note captions um should they want to see this in visual form I also want to thank you for assembling the structure not just as a tutorial but because at least to my knowledge no such structure or summary of these structures exists anywhere in the world and certainly not in any form that the the non-clinician and not you know highly trained psychiatrist uh could ever access around understand so uh this is both an immense resource and an immense gift to us all thank you so very much you're so welcome and thank you for having me here which is a gift um to be continued in the next episode thank you thank you for joining me for this first episode of our series on Mental Health with

Title: Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience
Published: 2023-09-04 12:00:51 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Marc Andreessen, the legendary software innovator who co-created the internet browser Mosaic, co-founded Netscape, and is now at Andreessen Horowitz — a venture capital firm that finds and brings to life technologies that transform humanity. We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation. This episode is for those interested in the innovative mind, psychology, human behavior, technology, culture and politics.

Transcript Language: English
Andrew Huberman: [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Marc Andreessen. Marc Andreessen is a software engineer and an investor in technology companies. He co-founded and developed Mosaic, which was one of the first widely used web browsers. He also co-founded and developed Netscape, which was one of the earliest widespread used web browsers. And he co-founded and is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most successful Silicon Valley venture capital firms. All of that is to say that Mark Andreessen is one of the most successful innovators and investors ever. I was extremely excited to record this episode with Marc for several reasons. First of all, he himself is an incredible innovator. Second of all, he has an uncanny ability to spot the innovators of the future. And third, Marc has shown over and over again the ability to understand how technologies not yet even developed are going to impact the way that humans interact at large. Our conversation starts off by discussing what makes for an exceptional innovator, as well as what sorts of environmental conditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally. In that context, we talk about risk taking, not just in terms of risk taking in one's profession, but about how some people, not all, but how some people who are risk takers and innovators in the context of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and some of the consequences that can bring. Then we discuss some of the most transformative technologies that are now emerging, such as novel approaches to developing clean energy, as well as AI or artificial intelligence. With respect to AI, Marc shares his views as to why AI is likely to greatly improve human experience, and we discuss the multiple roles that AI is very likely to have in all of our lives in the near future. Marc explains how not too long from now, all of us are very likely to have AI assistants, for instance, assistants that give us highly informed health advice, highly informed psychological advice. Indeed, it is very likely that all of us will soon have AI assistants that govern most, if not all, of our daily decisions. And Marc explains how, if done correctly, this can be a tremendously positive addition to our life. In doing so, Marc provides a stark argument for those that argue that AI is going to diminish human experience. So if you're hearing about and or concerned about the ways that AI is likely to destroy us today, you are going to hear about the many different ways that AI technologies now in development are likely to enhance our human experience at every level. What you'll soon find is that while today's discussion does center around technology and technology development, it is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology. So whether you have an interest in technology development and or AI, I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon be the future that we all live in. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire a nd effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar. The electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health, physical health, and performance. Even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think, our energy levels and our physical performance. LMNT makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration, and it does so by including the three electrolytes in the exact ratios they need to be present. I drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up. I usually mix it with about 16 to 32oz of water. If I'm exercising, I'll drink one while I'm exercising, and I tend to drink one after exercising as well. Now, many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we don't want to consume sodium in excess. However, for people that have normal blood pressure, and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets, that is consuming not so many processed foods or highly processed foods, oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium, magnesium and potassium, and we can suffer as a consequence. And with LMNT , simply by mixing in water, it tastes delicious. It's very easy to get that proper hydration. If you'd like to try LMNT , you can go to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T, .com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting a great night's sleep, is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance. When we're sleeping well, everything goes far better. And when we are not sleeping well or enough, everything gets far worse at the level of mental health, physical health and performance. Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is that you have to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your core body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, you want your core body temperature to increase by about one to three degrees. With Eight Sleep , it's very easy to induce that drop in core body temperature by cooling your mattress early and throughout the night and warming your mattress toward morning. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover a few years ago, and it has completely transformed the quality of the sleep that I get. So much so that I actually loathe traveling because I don't have my Eight Sleep mattress cover when I travel. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep , you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman and you'll save up to $150 off their Pod 3 Cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in t he EU and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Marc Andreessen. Marc, welcome. Marc Andreessen: Hey, thank you. Andrew Huberman: Delighted to have you here and have so many questions for you about innovation AI, your view of the landscape of tech, and humanity in general. I want to start off by talking about innovation from three different perspectives. There's the inner game, so to speak, or the psychology of the innovator, or innovators, things like their propensity for engaging in conflict or not, their propensity for having a dream or a vision, and in particular, their innovation as it relates to some psychological trait or expression. So we'll get to that in a moment. The second component that I'm curious about is the outer landscape around innovators, who they place themselves with, the sorts of choices that they make and also the sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have. And then the last component is this notion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in. What time in history? What's the geography? Bay Area, New York, Dubai, etc. So to start off, is there a common trait of innovators that you think is absolutely essential as a seed to creating things that are really impactful? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So I'm not a psychologist, but I've picked up some of the concepts and some of the terms. And so it was a great moment of delight in my life when I learned about the Big Five personality traits, because I was like, aha, there's a way to actually describe the answer to this question in at least reasonably scientific terms. And so I think what you're looking for, when you're talking about real innovators, like people who actually do really creative breakthrough work, I think you're talking about a couple of things. So one is very high in what's called trait openness, which is one of the Big Five, which is basically just like, flat out open to new ideas. And of course, the nature of trait openness is trait openness means you're not just open to new ideas in one category, you're open to many different kinds of new ideas. And so we might talk about the fact that a lot of innovators also are very creative people in other aspects of their lives, even outside of their specific creative domain. So that's important. But of course, just being open is not sufficient, because if you're just open, you could just be curious and explore and spend your entire life reading and doing, talking to people and never actually create something. So you also need a couple of other things. You need a high level of conscientiousness, which is another one of the Big Five. You need somebody who's really willing to apply themselves, and in our world, typically over a period of many years to be able to accomplish something great. They typically work very hard. That often gets obscured because the stories that end up getting told about these people are, it's just like this kid, and he just had this idea, and it was like a stroke of genius. And it was like a moment in time and was just like, oh, he was so lucky. And it's like, no, for most of these people, it's years and years and years of applied effort. And so you need somebody with an extreme, basically, willingness to defer gratification and really apply themselves to a specific thing for a long time. And of course, this is why there aren't very many of these people, there aren't many people who are high in openness and high in conscientiousness because to a certain extent, they're opposed traits. And so you need somebody who has both of those. Third is you need somebody high in disagreeableness, which is the third of the Big Five. So you need somebody who's just basically ornery, because if they're not ornery, then they'll be talked out of their ideas by people who will be like, oh, well, because the reaction, most people have new ideas is, oh, that's dumb. And so somebody who's too agreeable will be easily dissuaded to not pursue, not pulling the thread anymore. So you need somebody highly disagreeable. Again, the nature of disagreeableness is they tend to be disagreeable about everything. So they tend to be these very sort of iconoclastic kind of renegade characters. And then there's just a table stakes component, which is they just also need to be high IQ. They just need to be really smart because it's hard to innovate in any category if you can't synthesize large amounts of information quickly. And so those are four basically high spikes, very rare traits that basically have to come together. You could probably also say they probably at some point need to be relatively low on neuroticism, which is another of the Big Five, because if they're too neurotic, they probably can't handle the stress. Right. So it's kind of this dial in there. And then, of course, if you're into the sort of science of the Big Five, basically these are all people who are on the far outlying kind of point on the normal distribution across all these traits. And then that just gets you to, I think, the sort of hardest topic of all around this whole concept, which there are very few of these people. Andrew Huberman: Do you think they're born with these traits? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, they're born with the traits. And then, of course, the traits are not genetics, are not destiny, and so the traits are not deterministic in the sense of that just because they have those personality traits doesn't mean they're going to deliver great creativity, but they need to have those properties because otherwise they're just not either going to be able to do the work or they're not going to enjoy it. Right. I mean, look, a lot of these people are highly capable, competent people. It's very easy for them to get, like, high paying jobs in traditional institutions and get lots of traditional awards and end up with big paychecks. And there's a lot of people at big institutions that you and I know well, and I deal with many of these where people get paid a lot of money and they get a lot of respect and they go for 20 years and it's great and they never create anything new, right? There's a lot of administrators, a lot of them end up in administrative jobs, and that's fine, that's good. The world needs that also, right? The innovators can't run everything because the rate of change would be too high. Society, I think, probably wouldn't be able to handle it. So you need some people who are on the other side who are going to kind of keep the lights on and keep things running. But there is this decision that people have to make, which is okay if I have the sort of latent capability to do this, is this actually what I want to spend my life doing? And do I want to go through the stress and the pain and the trauma and anxiety and the risk of failure? And so, do I really want to? Once in a while you run into somebody who's just like, can't do it any other way. They just have to. Andrew Huberman: Who's an example of that? Marc Andreessen: I mean, Elon's the paramount example of our time, and I bring him up in part because he's such an obvious example, but in part because he's talked about this in interviews where he basically says, he's like, I can't turn it off. The ideas come, I have to pursue them, right? It's why he's like running five companies at the same time and, like working on a sixth. It's just like he can't turn it off. Look, there's a lot of other people who probably had the capability to do it, who ended up talking themselves into or whatever events conspired to put them in a position where they did something else. Obviously, there are people who try to be creative, who just don't have the capability. And so, there's some venn diagram there of determinism through traits, but also choices in life, and then also, of course, the situation in which they're born, the context within which they grow up, culture, what their parents expect of them, and so forth. And so to kind of get all the way through this, you have to thread all these needles kind of at the same time. Andrew Huberman: Do you think there are folks out there that meet these criteria who are disagreeable, but that can feign agreeableness, you know that can...? [BOTH LAUGH] For those just listening, Marc just raised his right hand. In other words, they can sort of, phrase that comes to mind maybe because I can relate to it a little bit, they sneak up through the system, meaning they behave ethically as it relates to the requirements of the system. They're not breaking laws or breaking rules, in fact, quite the opposite, they're paying attention to the rules and following the rules until they get to a place where being disagreeable feels less threatening to their overall sense of security. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, I mean, look, the really highly competent people don't have to break laws, right? There was this myth that happened around the movie The Godfather , and then there was this character, Meyer Lansky, who's like, ran basically the Mafia 50, 60, 70 years ago. And there was this great line of like, well, if Meyer Lansky had only applied himself to running General Motors, he would have been the best CEO of all time. It's like, no, not really, right? The people who are great at running the big companies, they don't have to be mob bosses. They don't have to break laws. They're smart and sophisticated enough to be able to work inside the system. They don't need to take the easy out. So, I don't think there's any implication that they have to break laws. That said, they have to break norms, right? And specifically, this is probably the thing that gets missed the most, because the process of innovating, the process of creating something new, once it works, the stories get retconned, as they say in comic books. So the stories get adapted to where it's like it was inevitable all along. Everybody always knew that this was a good idea. The person has won all these awards, society embraced them. And invariably, if you were with them when they were actually doing the work, or if you actually get a couple of drinks into them and talk about it, it'd be like, no, that's not how it happened at all. They faced a wall of skepticism, just like a wall of basically social, essentially denial. No, this is not going to work. No, I'm not going to join your lab. No, I'm not going to come work for your company. No, I'm not going to buy your product, right? No, I'm not going to meet with you. And so they get just like tremendous social resistance. They're not getting positive feedback from their social network the way that more agreeable people need to have, right? And this is why agreeableness is a problem for innovation. If you're agreeable, you're going to listen to the people around you. They're going to tell you that new ideas are stupid, end of story. You're not going to proceed. And so I would put it more on like, they need to be able to deal with, they need to be able to deal with social discomfort to the level of ostracism, or at some point they're going to get shaken out and they're just going to quit. Andrew Huberman: Do you think that people that meet these criteria do best by banding with others that meet these criteria early? Or is it important that they form this deep sense of self, like the ability to cry oneself to sleep at night or lie in the fetal position, worrying that things aren't going to work out and then still get up the next morning and get right back out there. Marc Andreessen: Right. So, Sean Parker has the best line, by the way, on this. He says being an entrepreneur or being a creator is like getting punched in the face over and over again. He said, eventually you start to like the taste of your own blood. And I love that line because it makes everybody massively uncomfortable, but it gives you a sense of how basically painful the process is. If you talk to any entrepreneur who's been through it about that, they're like, oh, yeah, that's exactly what it's like. So, there is a big individual component to it. But look, it can be very lonely, and especially very hard, I think, to do this if nobody around you is trying to do anything even remotely similar. And if you're getting just universally negative responses, like very few people, I think very few people have the ego strength to be able to survive that for years. So I do think there's a huge advantage, and this is why you do see clusters. There's a huge advantage to clustering. Throughout history, you've had this clustering effect. You had clustering of the great artists and sculptors in, you had the clustering of the philosophers of Greece. You had the clustering of tech people in Silicon Valley. You have the clustering of know, arts, movie, TV people in Los Angeles, and so forth. And so, know, there's always a scene, right? There's always, like a nexus and a place where people come together for these kinds of things. So, generally speaking, if somebody wants to work in tech, innovate in tech, they're going to be much better off being around a lot of people who are trying to do that kind of thing than they are in a place where nobody else is doing it. Having said that, the clustering can have downsides, it can have side effects. And you put any group of people together, and you do start to get groupthink, even among people who are individually very disagreeable. And so these same clusters where you get these very idiosyncratic people, they do have fads and trends just like every place else. And so they get wrapped up in their own social dynamics. The good news is the social dynamic in those places is usually very forward looking, and so it's usually like, I don't know, it's like a herd of iconoclasts looking for the next big thing. So iconoclasts, looking for the next big thing. That's good. The herd part. That's what you've got to be careful of. So even when you're in one of these environments, you have to be careful that you're not getting sucked into the groupthink too much. Andrew Huberman: When you say groupthink, do you mean excessive friction? Do you do pressure testing each other's ideas to the point where things just don't move forward? Or are you talking about groupthink, where people start to form a consensus? Or the self belief that, gosh, we are so strong because we are so different? Can we better define groupthink? Marc Andreessen: It's actually less either one of those things both happen. Those are good. Those are good. The part of groupthink I'm talking about is just like, we all basically zero in, we just end up zeroing in on the same ideas. Right. In Hollywood, there's this classic thing. There are years where all of a sudden there's, like, a lot of volcano movies. It's like, why are there all these volcano movies? And it's just like, there was just something in the gestalt, right? There was just something in the air. Look, Silicon Valley has this. There are moments in time where you'll have these. It's like the old thing. What's the difference between a fad and a trend? Fad is the trend that doesn't last. Right. And so Silicon Valley is subject to both fads and trends, just like any place. In other words, you take smart, disagreeable people, you cluster them together, they will act like a herd. They will end up thinking the same things unless they try very hard not to. Andrew Huberman: You've talked about these personality traits of great innovators before, and we're talking about them now. You invest in innovators, you try and identify them, and you are one. So you can recognize these traits here. I'm making the presumption that you have these traits. Indeed you do. We'll just get that out of the way. Have you observed people trying to feign these traits, and are there any specific questions or behaviors that are a giveaway that they're pretending to be the young Steve Jobs or that they're pretending to be the young Henry Ford? Pick your list of other names that qualify as authentic, legitimate innovators. We won't name names of people who have tried to disguise themselves as true innovators. But what are some of the litmus tests? And I realize here that we don't want you to give these away to the point where they lose their potency. But if you could share a few of those. Marc Andreessen: Good, we're actually a pretty open book on this. First of all, yes, so there are people who definitely try to come in and basically present as being something that they're not, and they've read all the books. They will have listened to this interview. They study everything and they construct a facade, and they come in and present as something they're not. I would say the amount of that varies exactly, correlated to the NASDAQ. And so when stock prices are super low, you actually get the opposite. When stock prices are super low, people get too demoralized. And people who should be doing it basically give up because they just think that the industry is over, the trend is over, whatever. It's all hopeless. And so you get this flushing thing. So nobody ever shows up at a stock market low and says, like, I'm the new next big thing and doesn't really want to do it because there are higher status, the kinds of people who do the thing that you're talking about, they're fundamentally oriented for social status. They're trying to get the social status without actually the substance. And there are always other places to go to get social status. So after 2000, the joke was, when I got to Silicon Valley in '93, '94, the Valley was dead. We can talk about that. By '98, it was roaring, and you had a lot of these people showing up, who were, you basically had a lot of people showing up with these kind of stories. 2000, the market crashed. By 2001, the joke was that there were these terms, B to C and B to B. And in 1998, they meant B to C meant business to consumer and B to B meant business to business, which is two different kinds of business models for Internet companies. By 2001, B to B meant back to banking and B to C meant back to consulting, which is the high status people who, the people oriented to status, who showed up to be in tech were like, yeah, screw it. This is over. Stick a fork in it. I'm going to go back to Goldman Sachs or go back to McKinsey, where I can be high status. And so you get this flushing kind of effect that happens in a downturn. That said, in a big upswing, yeah, you get a lot of people showing up with a lot of kind of, let's say, public persona without the substance to back it up. So the way we stress that you can actually say exactly how we test for this, because the test exactly addresses the issue in a way that is impossible to fake. And it's actually the same way homicide detectives try to find out if you've actually, like, if you're innocent or whether you've killed somebody. It's the same tactic, which is, you ask increasingly detailed questions, right? And so the way the homicide cop does this is, what were you doing last night? Oh, I was at a movie. Which movie? Which theater? Okay, which seat did you sit in? Okay, what was the end of the movie? And you ask increasingly detailed questions and people have trouble. At some point, people have trouble making up and things just fuzz into just kind of obvious bullshit. And basically fake founders basically have the same problem. They're able to relay a conceptual theory of what they're doing that they've kind of engineered, but as they get into the details, it just fuzzes out. Whereas the true people that you want to back that can do it, basically what you find is they've spent five or ten or 20 years obsessing on the details of whatever it is they're about to do. And they're so deep in the details that they know so much more about it than you ever will. And in fact, the best possible reaction is when they get mad, which is also what the homicide cops say. What you actually want is you want the emotional response of like, I can't believe that you're asking me questions this detailed and specific and picky and they kind of figure out what you're doing and then they get upset. That's good, that's perfect, right? But then they have to have proven themselves in the sense of, they have to be able to answer the questions in great detail. Andrew Huberman: Do you think that people that are able to answer those questions in great detail have actually taken the time to systematically think through the if-ands of all the possible implications of what they're going to do and they have a specific vision in mind of how things need to turn out or will turn out? Or do you think that they have a vision and it's a no matter what, it will work out because the world will sort of bend around it? I mean, in other words, do you think that they place their vision in context or they simply have a vision and they have that tunnel vision of that thing and that's going to be it? Let's use you for an example with Netscape. That's how I first came to know your name. When you were conceiving Netscape, did you think, okay, there's this search engine and this browser and it's going to be this thing that looks this way and works this way and feels this way, did you think that? And also think about that there was going to be a gallery of other search engines and it would fit into that landscape of other search engines? Or were you just projecting your vision of this thing as this unique and special brainchild? Marc Andreessen: Let me give the general answer, and then we can talk about the specific example. So the general answer is what? Entrepreneurship, creativity, innovation is what economists call decision making under uncertainty. In both parts, those are important decision making. Like, you're going to make a ton of decisions because you have to decide what to do, what not to do. And then uncertainty, which is like, the world's a complicated place. And in mathematical terms, the world is a complex adaptive system with feedback loops. And Isaac Asimov wrote in his novels, he wrote about this field called psychohistory, which is the idea that there's like a supercomputer that can predict the future of human affairs, right? And it's like, we don't have that. [LAUGHS] Not yet. Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Not yet. We'll get to that later. Marc Andreessen: We certainly don't have that yet. And so you're just dealing, you know, military commanders call this the fog of war, right? You're just dealing with a situation where the number of variables are just off the charts. It's all these other people who are inherently unpredictable, making all these decisions in different directions. And then the whole system is combinatorial, which is these people are colliding with each other, influencing their decisions. And so, I mean, look, the most straightforward kind of way to think about this is, it's amazing. Like, anybody who believes in economic central planning, it always blows my mind because it's just like, try opening a restaurant. Try just opening a restaurant on the corner down here. And like 50/50 odds, the restaurant is going to work. And all you have to do to run a restaurant is have a thing and serve food. And it's like most restaurants fail, right? People who run restaurants are pretty smart. They usually think about these things very hard, and they all want to succeed, and it's hard to do that. And so to start a tech company or to start an artistic movement or to fight a war, you're just going into this, basically conceptual battleground or in military terms, real battleground, where there's just like incredible levels of complexity, branching future paths, and so there's nothing predictable. And so what we look for is basically the really good innovators. They've got a drive to basically be able to cope with that and deal with that. And they basically do that in two steps. So one is they try to pre-plan as much as they possibly can and we call that the process of navigating the, what we call the idea maze. And so the idea maze basically is, I've got this general idea, and it might be the Internet is going to work or search or whatever, and then it's like, okay, in their head, they have thought through of like, okay, if I do it this way, that way, this third way, here's what will happen. Then I have to do that, then I have to do this, then I have to bring in somebody to do that. Here's the technical challenge I'm going to hit. And they got in their heads as best anybody could, they've got as complete a sort of a map of possible futures as they could possibly have. And this is where I say, when you ask them increasingly detailed questions, that's what you're trying to kind of get them to kind of chart out, is, okay, how far ahead have you thought, and how much are you anticipating all of the different twists and turns that this is going to take? Okay, so then they start on day one, and then, of course, what happens is now they're in it, now they're in the fog of war, right? They're in future uncertainty. And now that idea maze is maybe not helpful practically, but now they're going to be basically constructing it on the fly, day by day, as they learn and discover new things and as the world changes around them. And of course, it's a feedback loop, because if their thing starts to work, it's going to change the world. And then the fact the world is changing is going to cause their plan to change as well. And so, yeah, the great ones, basically, the great ones course correct every single day. They take stock of what they've learned. They modify the plan. The great ones tend to think in terms of hypotheses, right? Like a scientific sort of mentality, which is they tend to think, okay, I'm going to try this. I'm going to go into the world, I'm going to announce that I'm doing this for sure. I'm going to say, this is my plan. I'm going to tell all my employees that, and I'm going to tell all my investors that, and I'm going to put a stake in there, and it's my plan, and then I'm going to try it, and even though I sound like I have complete certainty, I know that I need to test to find out whether it's going to work. And if it's not, then I have to go back to all those same people and have to say, well, actually, we're not going left, we're going right. And they have to run that loop thousands of times to get through the other side. And this led to the creation of this great term pivot, which has been very helpful in our industry because the word, when I was young, the word we used was fuck up, and pivot sounds like so much better, sounds like so much more professional. But, yeah, you make mistakes. It's just too complicated to understand. You course correct, you adjust, you evolve. Often these things, at least in business, the businesses that end up working really well tend to be different than the original plan, but that's part of the process of a really smart founder basically working their way through reality as they're executing their plan. Andrew Huberman: The way you're describing this has parallels to a lot of models in biology and the practice of science, random walks, but that aren't truly random, pseudo-random walks in biology, etc. But one thing that is becoming clear from the way you're describing this is that I could imagine a great risk to early success. So, for instance, somebody develops a product, people are excited by it, they start to implement that product, but then the landscape changes, and they don't learn how to pivot to use the less profane version of it. They don't learn how to do that. In other words, and I think of everything these days, or most everything, in terms of reward schedules and dopamine reward schedules, because that is the universal currency of reward. And so when you talk about the Sean Parker quote of learning to enjoy the taste of one's own blood, that is very different than learning to enjoy the taste of success, right? It's about internalizing success as a process of being self determined and less agreeable, etc. In other words, building up of those five traits becomes the source of dopamine, perhaps in a way that's highly adaptive. So on the outside, we just see the product, the end product, the iPhone, the MacBook, the Netscape, etc. But I have to presume, and I'm not a psychologist, but I have done neurophysiology and I've studied the dopamine system enough to know that what's being rewarded in the context of what you're describing sounds to be a reinforcement of those five traits, rather than, oh, it's going to be this particular product, or the company is going to look this way, or the logo is going to be this or that. That all seems like the peripheral to what's really going on, that great innovators are really in the process of establishing neural circuitry that is all about reinforcing the me and the process of being. Marc Andreessen: So this is like extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation. So, the Steve Jobs kind of Zen version of this, right? Or the sort of hippie version of this was the journey is the reward. He always told his employees that. It's like, look, everybody thinks in terms of these big public markers, like the stock price or the IPO or the product launch or whatever. He's like, no, it's actually the process itself is the point. Right to your point, if you have that mentality, then that's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic motivation. And so that's the kind of intrinsic motivation that can keep you going for a long time. Another way to think about it is competing against yourself, right? It's like, can I get better at doing this? And can I prove to myself that I can get better? There's also a big social component to this, and this is one of the reasons why Silicon Valley punches so far above its weight as a place. There's a psychological component which also goes to the comparison set. So a phenomenon that we've observed over time is the leading tech company in any city will aspire to be as large as the previous leading tech company in that city, but often not larger, right? Because they have a model of success. And as long as they beat that level of success, they've kind of checked the box like they've made it. But then, in contrast, you're in Silicon Valley, and you look around and it's just like Facebook and Cisco and Oracle and Hewlett Packard and-- Andrew Huberman: --Gladiators-- Marc Andreessen: --Yeah. And you're just, like, looking at these giants. Many of them are still, Mark Zuckerberg, still going to work every day. And so these people are, like, the role models are, like, alive. They're, like, right there, and it's so clear how much better they are and how much bigger their accomplishments are. And so what we find is young founders in that environment have much greater aspirations. Because, again, at that point, maybe it's the social status, maybe there's an extrinsic component to that, or maybe it helps calibrate that internal system to basically say, actually, no, the opportunity here is not to build what you may call a local maximum form of success, but let's build to a global maximum form of success, which is something as big as we possibly can. Ultimately, the great ones are probably driven more internally than externally when it comes down to it. And that is where you get this phenomenon where you get people who are extremely successful and extremely wealthy who very easily could punch out and move to Fiji and just call it, and they're still working 16 hour days. Obviously something explains that that has nothing to do with external rewards, and I think it's an internal thing. Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day. But oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of Vitamin D3K2. Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman. I've heard you talk a lot about the inner landscape, the inner psychology of these folks, and I appreciate that. We're going even deeper into that today. And we will talk about the landscape around whether or not Silicon Valley or New York, whether or not there are specific cities that are ideal for certain types of pursuits. I think there was an article written by Paul Graham some years ago, about the conversations that you overhear in a city will tell you everything you need to know about whether or not you belong there in terms of your professional pursuits. Some of that's changed over time, and now we should probably add Austin to the mix because it was written some time ago. In any event, I want to return to that, but I want to focus on an aspect of this intrinsic versus extrinsic motivators in terms of something that's a bit more cryptic, which is one's personal relationships. If I think about the catalog of innovators in Silicon Valley, some of them, like Steve Jobs, had complicated personal lives, romantic personal lives early on, and it sounds like he worked it out. I don't know. I wasn't their couple's therapist. But when he died, he was in a marriage that for all the world seemed like a happy marriage. You also have examples of innovators who have had many partners, many children with other partners. Elon comes to mind. I don't think I'm disclosing anything that isn't already obvious. Those could have been happy relationships and just had many of them. But the reason I'm asking this is you can imagine that for the innovator, the person with these traits, who's trying to build up this thing, whatever it is, that having someone, or several people in some cases, who just truly believe in you when the rest of the world may not believe in you yet or at all, could be immensely powerful. And we have examples from cults that embody this. We have examples from politics. We have examples from tech innovation and science. And I've always been fascinated by this because I feel like it's the more cryptic and yet very potent form of allowing someone to build themselves up. It's a combination of inner psychology and extrinsic motivation. Because obviously, if that person were to die or leave them or cheat on them or pair up with some other innovator, which we've seen several times recently and in the past, it can be devastating to that person. But what are your thoughts on the role of personal, and in particular, romantic relationship as it relates to people having an idea and their feeling that they can really bring that idea to fruition in the world? Marc Andreessen: So it's a real mixed bag. You have lots of examples in all directions, and I think it's something like. Something like the following. So first, we talked about the personality traits of these people. They tend to be highly disagreeable. Andrew Huberman: Doesn't foster a good romantic relationship. Marc Andreessen: Highly disagreeable people can be difficult to be in a relationship. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] I may have heard of that once or twice before. A friend may have given me that example. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Right. And maybe you just need to find the right person who compliments that and is willing to, there's a lot of relationships where it's always this question about relationships, right? Which is, do you want to have the same personality growth profile, the same behavioral traits, basically, as your partner, or do you actually want to have, is it an opposite thing? I'm sure you've seen this. There are relationships where you'll have somebody who's highly disagreeable, who's paired with somebody who's highly agreeable, and it actually works out great because one person just gets to be on their soapbox all the time, and the other person is just like, okay, it's fine. Right? It's fine. It's good. You put two disagreeable people together, maybe sparks fly and they have great conversations all the time, and maybe they come to hate each other. Anyway, so these people, if you're going to be with one of these people, you're fishing out of the disagreeable end of the pond. And again, when I say disagreeable, I don't mean these are normal distributions. I don't mean, like 60% disagreeable or 80% disagreeable. The people we're talking about are 99.99% disagreeable. So these are ordinary people. So part of it's that. And then, of course, they have the other personality traits. They're super conscientious. They're super driven. As a consequence, they tend to work really hard. They tend to not have a lot of time for family vacations or other things. Then they don't enjoy them if they're forced to go on them. And so, again, that kind of thing can fray at a relationship. So there's a fair amount in there that's loaded. Like, somebody who's going to partner with one of these people needs to be signed up for the ride. And that's a hard thing. That's a hard thing to do. Or you need a true partnership of two of these, which is also hard to do. So I think that's part of it. And then, look, I think a big part of it is people achieve a certain level of success, and either in their own minds or publicly, and then they start to be able to get away with things, right? And they start to be able to. It's like, well, okay, now we're rich and successful and famous, and now I deserve, and this is where you get into... I view this now in the realm of personal choice. You get into this thing where people start to think that they deserve things, and so they start to behave in very bad ways, and then they blow up their personal worlds as a consequence. And maybe they regret it later, and maybe they don't. Right? It's always a question. I think there's that. And then, I don't know, maybe the other part of it is that some people just need more emotional support than others. And I don't know that that's a big, I don't know that that tilts either way. I know some of these people who have great, loving relationships and seem to draw very much on having this kind of firm foundation to rely upon. And then I know other people who are just like, their personal lives are just a continuous train wreck. And it doesn't seem to matter, like, professionally, they just keep doing what they're doing. And maybe we could talk here about whatever is the personality trait for risk taking. Some people are so incredibly risk prone that they need to take risk in all aspects of their lives at all times. And if part of their life gets stable, they find a way to blow it up. And that's some of these people you could describe in those terms also. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, let's talk about that. Because I think risk taking and sensation seeking is something that fascinates me for my own reasons and in my observations of others. Does it dovetail with these five traits in a way that can really serve innovation, in ways that can benefit everybody? The reason I say to benefit everybody is because there is a view of how we're painting this picture of the innovator as this really cruel person. But oftentimes, what we're talking about are innovations that make the world far better for billions of people. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right. And by the way, everything we're talking about also is not just in tech or science or in business. Everything we're also talking about is true for the arts. The history of artistic expression. You have people with all these same kinds of traits. Andrew Huberman: Well, I was thinking about Picasso and his regular turnover of lovers and partners, and he was very open about the fact that it was one of the sources of his productivity, creativity. He wasn't shy about that. I suppose if he were alive today, it might be a little bit different. He might be judged a little differently. Marc Andreessen: Or that was his story for behaving in a pattern that was very awful for the people around him, and he didn't care. Andrew Huberman: Right, maybe they left him? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Who knows? Right? Puts and takes to all this, but no. Okay, so I have a theory. So here's a theory. This is one of these, I keep a list of things that will get me kicked out of a dinner party and topics at any given point in time. Andrew Huberman: Do you read it before you go in? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. On auto recall, so that I can get out of these things. Here's the thing that can get me kicked out of a dinner party, especially these days. So think of the kind of person where it's very clear that they're super high, to your point, this is somebody who's super high output in whatever domain they're in. They've done things that have fundamentally changed the world. They've brought new, whether it's businesses or technologies or works of art, entire schools of creative expression, in some cases to the world. And then at a certain point, they blow themselves to smithereens, right? And they do that either through a massive financial scandal. They do that through a massive personal breakdown. They do that through some sort of public expression that causes them a huge amount of problems. They say the wrong thing, maybe not once, but several hundred times, and blow themselves to smithereens. There's this moral arc that people kind of want to apply, which it's like the Icarus flying too close to the sun and he had it coming and he needed to keep his ego under control. And you get kind of this judgment that applies. So I have a different theory on this. So the term I use to describe these people, and by the way, a lot of other people who don't actually blow themselves up but get close to it, which is a whole 'nother set of people, I call them martyrs to civilizational progress. We're backwards, civilizational progress. So look, the only way civilization gets moved forward is when people like this do something new. Because civilization as a whole does not do new things. Groups of people do not do new things. These things don't happen automatically. By default nothing changes. The only way civilizational change on any of these axes ever happens is because one of these people stands up and says, no, I'm going to do something different than what everybody else has ever done before. So, this is progress, like, this is actually how it happens. Sometimes they get lionized or awarded. Sometimes they get crucified. Sometimes the crucifixion is literal. Sometimes it's just symbolic. But they are those kinds of people, and then martyrs when they go down in flames and again, this is where it really screws the people's moral judgments because everybody wants to have the sort of super clear story of like, okay, he did a bad thing and he was punished. And I'm like, no, he was the kind of person who was going to do great things and also was going to take on a level of risk and take on a level of sort of extreme behavior such that he was going to expose himself to flying too close to the sun, wings melt and crash to ground. But it's a package deal. The reason you have the Picasso's and the Beethovens and all these people is because they're willing to take these extreme level of risks. They are that creative and original, not just in their art or their business, but in everything else that they do that they will set themselves up to be able to fail psychologically. A psychologist would probably, or psychiatrist would probably say maybe. To what extent do they actually have a death wish at some point. Do they want to punish themselves? Do they want to fail? That I don't know. But you see this. They deliberately move themselves too close to the sun, and you can see it when it's happening, because if they get too far away from the sun, they deliberately move back towards it. Right. They come right back, and they want the risk anyway. So martyrs to civilizational progress. This is how progress happens. When these people crash and burn, the natural inclination is to judge them morally. I tend to think we should basically say, look, and I don't even know if this means, like, giving them a moral pass or whatever, but it's like, look, this is how civilization progresses, and we need to at least understand that there's a self sacrificial aspect to this that may be tragic and often is tragic, but it is quite literally self sacrificial. Andrew Huberman: Are there any examples of great innovators who were able to compartmentalize their risk taking to such a degree that they had what seemed to be a morally impeccable life in every domain except in their business pursuits? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right. So some people are very highly controlled like that. Some people are able to very narrowly, and I don't really want to set myself an example on a lot of this, but I will tell you as an example, I will never use debt in business, number one. Number two, I have the most placid personal life you can imagine. Number three, I'm the last person in the world who is ever going to do an extreme sport. I mean, I'm not even going to go in the sauna on the ice bath. I'm not doing any of this. I'm not tele skiing. Andrew Huberman: No obligation. Marc Andreessen: I'm not on the Titan. I'm not going down to see the Titanic. Goodness, you weren't doing any of this. I'm not doing any of this stuff. I have no interest. I don't play golf. I don't ski. I have no interest in any of this stuff, right? And I know people like this, right, who are very high achievers. It's just like, yeah, they're completely segmented. They're extreme risk takers. In business, they're completely buttoned down on the personal side, they're completely buttoned down financially. They're scrupulous with following every rule and law you can possibly imagine, but they're still fantastic innovators. And then I know many others who are just like their life is on fire all the time, in every possible way. And whenever it looks like the fire is turning into embers, they figure out a way to relight the fire, and they just really want to live on the edge. And so I think that's an independent variable. And again, I would apply the same thing. I think the same thing applies to the arts. Classical music as an example. I think Bach was, as an example, one of the best musicians of all time, had just a completely sedate personal life, never had any aberrant behavior at all in his personal life. Family man, tons of kids, apparently pillar of the community. Right. And so if Bach could be Bach and yet not burn his way through 300 mistresses or whatever, maybe you can, too. Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about these two different categories of innovators, those that take on tremendous risk in all domains of their life and those that take on tremendous risk in a very compartmentalized way, I don't know what the percentages are, but I have to wonder if in this modern age of the public being far less forgivable, what I'm referring to is cancel culture. Do you think that we are limiting the number of innovations in total by just simply frightening or eliminating an enormous category of innovators because they don't have the confidence or the means or the strategies in place to regulate? So they're just either bowing out or they're getting crossed off, they're getting canceled one by one. Marc Andreessen: So do you think the public is less tolerant than they used to be or more tolerant? Andrew Huberman: Well, the systems that, I'm not going to be careful here. I think the large institution systems are not tolerant of what the public tells them they shouldn't be tolerant of. And so if there's enough noise, there's enough noise in the mob. I think institutions bow out. And here I'm referring not just to, they essentially say, okay, let the cancellation proceed. Maybe they're the gavel that comes down, but they're not the lever that got the thing going. And so I'm not just thinking about universities. I'm also thinking about advertisers. I'm thinking about the big movie houses that cancel a film that a given actor might be in because they had something in their personal life that's still getting worked out. I'm thinking about people who are in a legal process that's not yet resolved, but the public has decided they're a bad person, etc. Marc Andreessen: My question is, are we really talking about the public? I agree with your question, and I'm going to come back to it, but I'm going to examine one part of your question, which is, is this really the public we're talking about. And I would just say Exhibit A is who is the current frontrunner for the Republican nomination today? The public, at least on one side of the political aisle, seems very on board. Number two, like, look, there's a certain musician who flew too close to the sun, blew himself to smithereens. He's still hitting all time highs on music streams every month. The public seems fine. I would argue the public is actually more open to these things than it actually maybe ever has been. And we could talk about why that's the case. I think it's a differentiation, and this is what your question was aiming at, but it's a differentiation between the public and the elites. My view is everything that you just described is an elite phenomenon. And actually, the public is very much not on board with it. So what's actually happening is what's happened is the public and the elites have gapped out. The public is more forgiving of what previously might have been considered kind of aberant and extreme behavior, right? F. Scott Fitzgerald, "there are no second acts in American lives" turns out was completely wrong. Turns out there are second acts, third acts, fourth acts. Apparently you can have an unlimited number of acts. The public is actually up for it. Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I mean, I think of somebody like Mike Tyson, right? I feel like his life exemplifies everything. That's amazing and great and also terrible about America. Marc Andreessen: If we took Mike Tyson to dinner tonight at any restaurant anywhere in the United States, what would happen? Andrew Huberman: He would be loved. Marc Andreessen: Oh, he would be like, the outpouring of enthusiasm and passion and love would be incredible. It would be unbelievable. This is a great example. And again, I'm not even going to draw more. I'm not even going to say I agree with that or disagree with that. I think we all intuitively know that the public is just like, 100%, absolutely. He's a legend. He's a living legend. He's like a cultural touchstone. Absolutely. And you see it when he shows up in movies, right? I don't remember the, I mean, the big breakthrough where I figured this out with respect to him because I don't really follow sports, but when he showed up in that, it was that first Hangover movie, and he shows up and I was in a theater and the audience just goes, bananas crazy. They're so excited to see him. Andrew Huberman: He evokes delight. I always say that Mike Tyson is the only person I'm aware of that can wear a shirt with his own name on it, and it somehow doesn't seem wrong. In fact, it just kind of makes you like him more. His ego feels very contoured in a way that he knows who he is and who he was, and yet there's a humbleness woven in, maybe as a consequence of all that he's been through. I don't know. But, yeah, people love Mike. Marc Andreessen: Public loves him now. Exactly. Now, if he shows up to lecture at Harvard, right, I think you're probably going to get a different reaction? [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: I don't know. I don't know! You know, the guy who wrote The Wire gave a talk at Harvard, and it sounded to me, based on his report of that, which is very interesting, in fact, that people adore people who are connected to everybody in that way. I feel like everybody loves Mike. From above his status, the sides below his status, he occupies this halo of love and adoration. Marc Andreessen: Okay. Andrew Huberman: All right. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Look, the other side of this is the elites, and you kind of alluded to this, of the institution. So basically, it's like the people who are at least nominally in charge or feel like that they should be in charge. Andrew Huberman: I want to make sure we define elite. So you're not necessarily talking about people who are wealthy. You're talking about people who have authority within institutions. Marc Andreessen: So the ultimate definition of an elite is who can get who fired, right. That's the ultimate test. Who can get who fired, boycotted, blacklisted, ostracized. Like when push, prosecuted, jailed, like when push comes to shove. I think that's always the question, who can destroy whose career? And of course, you'll notice that that is heavily asymmetric when these fights play out. Like, it's very clear which side can get the other side fired and which side can't. And so, yeah, so, look, I think we live in a period of time where the elites have gotten to be extreme in a number of dimensions. I think it's characterized by, for sure, extreme groupthink, extreme sanctimony, extreme moral, I would say dudgeon, this weird sort of modern puritanism, and then an extreme sort of morality of punishment and terror against their perceived enemies. But I want to go through that because I actually think that's a very different phenomenon. I think what's happening at the elites is very different than what's happening in the population at large. And then, of course, I think there's a feedback loop in there, which is, I think the population at large is not on board with that program. Right. I think the elites are aware that the population is not on board WIth that program. I think they judge the population negatively as a consequence, that causes the elites to harden their own positions. That causes them to be even more alienating to the population. And so they're in sort of an oppositional negative feedback loop. But again, it's a sort of question, okay, who can get who fired? And so elites are really good at getting normal people fired. Ostracized, banned, hit pieces in the press, like, whatever. For normal people to get elites fired, they have to really band together, right. And really mount a serious challenge, which mostly doesn't happen, but might be starting to happen in some cases. Andrew Huberman: Do you think this power of the elites over, stemmed from social media sort of going against its original purpose? I mean, when you think social media, you think you're giving each and every person their own little reality TV show, their own voice. And yet we've seen a dramatic uptick in the number of cancellations and firings related to immoral behavior based on things that were either done or amplified on social media. It's almost as if the public is holding the wrong end of the knife. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so the way I describe it, I use these two terms, and they're somewhat interchangeable, but elites and institutions. And then they're somewhat interchangeable because who runs the institutions? The elites, right? And so it's sort of a self reinforcing thing. And institutions of all kinds. Institutions, everything from the government, bureaucracies, companies, nonprofits, foundations, NGOs, tech companies, on and on and on. Like people who are in charge of big complexes and that carry a lot of, basically, power and influence and capability and money as a consequence of their positional authority. So the head of a giant foundation may never have done anything in their life that would cause somebody to have a high opinion of them as a person. But they're in charge of this gigantic multi billion dollar complex and have all this power. And so that's just defined terms, at least in institutions. So, it's actually interesting. Gallup has been doing polls on the following on the question of trust in institutions, which is sort of therefore a proxy for trust in elites, basically since the early 1970s. And they do this across all the categories of big institutions, basically everyone. I just talked about a bunch of others. Big business, small business, banks, newspapers, broadcast television, the military, police. So they've got like 30 categories or something. And basically what you see is almost all the categories basically started in the early 70s at like 60 or 70% trust. And now almost across the board, they've just had a complete, basically linear slide down for 50 years, basically my whole life. And they're now bottoming out. Congress and journalists bottom out at like 10%. The two groups everybody hates are Congress and journalists. And then it's like a lot of other big institutions are like, in their 20s, 30s, 40s. Actually, big business actually scores fairly high. Tech actually scores quite high. The military scores quite high. But basically everything else has really caved in. This is sort of my fundamental challenge to everybody who basically says, and you didn't do this, but you'll hear the simple form of this, which is social media caused the current trouble. And let's call this an example, collapse in faith in institutions and elites. Let's call that part of the current trouble. Everybody's like, well, social media caused that. I was like, well, no, social media, social media is new, right? In the last... social media is effectively new, practically speaking, since 2010, 2012 is when it really took off. And so, if the trend started in the early 1970s and has been continuous, then we're dealing with something broader. Martin Gurri wrote, I think, the best book on this called the Revolt of the Public , where he goes through this in detail. He does say that social media had a lot to do with what's happened in the last decade. But he says, yeah, if you go back, you look further, it was basically two things coinciding. One was just a general change in the media environment. And in particular, the 1970s is when you started to, and especially in the 1980s, is when you started to get specifically talk radio, which was a new outlet. And then you also got cable television. And then you also, by the way, it's actually interesting in that you had paperback books, which was another one of these, which was an outlet. So you had like a fracturing in the media landscape that started in the 50s through the, then, of course, the Internet blew it wide open. Having said that, if the elites and the institutions were fantastic, you would know it more than ever. Information is more accessible. And so the other thing that he says, and I agree with, is the public is not being tricked into thinking the elites and institutions are bad. They're learning that they're bad, and therefore, the mystery of the Gallup poll is why those numbers aren't all just zero, which is arguably, in a lot of cases, where they should be. Andrew Huberman: I think one reason that-- Marc Andreessen: --By the way, he thinks this is bad. So he and I have a different view. So here's where he and I disagree. He thinks this is bad. So he basically says, you can't replace elites with nothing. You can't replace institutions with nothing, because what you're just left with is just going to be wreckage. You're going to be left with a completely, basically atomized, out of control society that has no ability to marshal any sort of activity in any direction. It's just going to be a dog eat dog awful world. I have a very different view on that which we can talk about. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd love to hear your views on that. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is, to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etc., mean, and behavioral supplement, nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health. InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APOB and of Insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. The quick question I was going to ask before we go there is, I think that one reason that I and many other people sort of reflexively assume that social media caused the demise of our faith and institutions is, well, first of all, I wasn't aware of this lack of correlation between the decline in faith in institutions and the rise of social media. But secondarily that we've seen some movements that have essentially rooted themselves in tweets, in comments, in posts that get amplified, and those tweets and comments and posts come from everyday people. In fact, I can't name one person who initiated a given cancellation or movement because it was the sort of dogpiling or mob adding-on to some person that was essentially anonymous. So I think that for many of us, we have the, to use neuroscience language, as sort of a bottom up perspective, oh, someone sees something in their daily life or experiences something in their daily life, and they tweet about it or they comment about it or they post about it, and then enough people dogpile on the accused that it picks up force, and then the elites feel compelled, obligated to cancel somebody. That tends to be the narrative. And so I think the logical conclusion is, oh, social media allows for this to happen. Whereas normally someone would just be standing on the corner shouting or calling lawyers that don't have faith in them, and you've got the Erin Brockovich model that turns into a movie. But that's a rare case of this lone woman who's got this idea in mind about how a big institution is doing wrong or somebody is doing wrong in the world and then can leverage the big institution, excuse me. But the way that you describe it is that the elites are leading this shift. So what is the role of the public in it? Just to give it a concrete example, if, for instance, no one tweeted or commented on me, too, or no one tweeted or commented about some ill behavior of some, I don't know, university faculty member or business person, would the elite have come down on them? Marc Andreessen: Anyway, what's happening? Based on what I've seen over the years, there is so much astroturfing right now. There are entire categories of people who are paid to do this. Some of them we call journalists, some of them we call activists, some of them we call NGO nonprofit. Some of them we call university professors, some of them we call grad students, whatever, they're paid to do this. I don't know if you've ever looked into the misinformation industrial complex? There's this whole universe of basically these funded groups that basically do misinformation. And they're constantly mounting these kinds of attacks. They're constantly trying to gin up this kind of basically panic to cause somebody to get fired. Andrew Huberman: So it's not a grassroots-- Marc Andreessen: --No. It's the opposite of grassroots. No. Almost always going to trace these things back. It was a journalist, it was an activist, it was a public figure of some kind. These are entrepreneurs in a sort of a weird way. Basically their job, mission calling, is all wrapped up together like they're true believers, but they're also getting paid to do it. And there's a giant funding, I mean, there's a very large funding complex for this coming from certain high profile people who put huge amounts of money into this. Andrew Huberman: Is this well known? Marc Andreessen: Yes. Well, it is in my world. So this is what the social media companies have been on the receiving end of for the last decade. It's basically a political media activism complex with very deep pockets behind it. And you've got people who basically, literally have people who sit all day and watch the TV network on the other side or watch the Twitter feeds on the other side, and they basically wait. It's like every politician, this has been the case for a long time now. Every politician who goes out and gives stump speeches, you'll see there's always somebody in the crowd with a camcorder or now with a phone recording them. And that's somebody from the other campaign who's paid somebody to just be there and record every single thing the politician says. So that when a Mitt Romney says, whatever, the 47% thing, they've got it on tape, and then they clip it, and they try to make it viral. And again, look, these people believe what they're doing. I'm not saying it's even dishonest. Like, these people believe what they're doing. They think they're fighting a holy war. They think they're protecting democracy. They think they're protecting civilization. They think they're protecting whatever it is they're protecting. And then they know how to use the tools, and so they know how to try to gin up the outrage. And then, by the way, sometimes it works in social cascades. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes they cascade, sometimes they don't. But if you follow these people on Twitter, this is what they do every day. They're constantly trying to, like, light this fire. Andrew Huberman: I assume that it was really bottom up, but it sounds like it's sort of middle level, and that it captures the elites, and then the thing takes on a life of its own. Marc Andreessen: By the way, it also intersects with the trust and safety groups at the social media firms who are responsible for figuring out who gets promoted and who gets banned across this. And you'll notice one large social media company has recently changed hands and has implemented a different kind of set of trust and safety. And all of a sudden, a different kind of boycott movement has all of a sudden started to work that wasn't working before that. And another kind of boycott movement is not working as well anymore. And so, for sure, there's an intermediation happening. Look, the stuff that's happening in the world today is being intermediated through social media, because social media is the defining media of our time. But there are people who know how to do this and do this for a living. No, I view very much the cancellation wave, like, this whole thing, it's an elite phenomenon, and when it appears to be a grassroots thing, it's either grassroots among the elites, which is possible because there's a fairly large number of people who are signed up for that particular crusade, but there's also a lot of astroturfing that's taking place inside that. The question is, okay, at what point does the population at large get pulled into this? And maybe there are movements, certain points in time where they do get pulled in, and then maybe later they get disillusioned. And so then there's some question there. And then there's another question of like, well, if the population at large is going to decide what these movements are, are they going to be the same movements that the elites want? And how are the elites going to react when the population actually fully expresses itself? Like I said, there's a feedback loop between these where the more extreme the elites get, they tend to push the population to more extreme views on the other side and vice versa. So it ping pongs back and forth. And so, yeah, this is our world. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, this explains a lot. Marc Andreessen: I want to make sure that Schellenberger, Matt Taibbi, a bunch of these guys have done a lot of work. If you just look into what's called the misinformation industrial complex, you'll find a network of money and power that is really quite amazing. Andrew Huberman: I've seen more and more Schellenberger showing up. Marc Andreessen: Right. And he's just, look, he's just on this stuff. He, and just, they're literally just like tracking money. It's very clear how the money flows, including a remarkable amount of money out of the government, which is, of course, in theory, very concerning. Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. Marc Andreessen: The government should not be funding programs that take away people's constitutional rights. And yet somehow that is what's been happening. Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. I want to make sure that I hear your ideas about why the decline in confidence in institutions is not necessarily problematic. Is this going to be a total destruction, burning down of the forest that will lead to new life? Is that your view? Marc Andreessen: Well, so this is the thing. And look, there's a question if you're, there's a couple of questions in here, which is like, how bad is it really? How bad are they? Right. And I think they're pretty bad. A lot of them are actually pretty bad. So that's one big question. And then, yeah, look, the other question is like, okay, if the institution has gone bad or a group of elites have gone bad, it's this wonderful word, reform, right? Can they be reformed? And everybody always wants to reform everything, and yet somehow nothing ever quite ever gets reformed. And so people are trying to reform housing policy in the Bay Area for decades, and we're not building. We're building fewer houses than ever before. So somehow reform movements seem to lead to just more bad stuff. But anyway, yeah. So if you have an existing institution, can it be reformed? Can it be fixed from the inside? What's happened in universities? There are professors at Stanford as an example, who very much think that they can fix Stanford. Like, I don't know what you think. It doesn't seem like it's going in productive directions right now. Andrew Huberman: Well, I mean, there are many things about Stanford that function extremely well. It's a big institution. It's certainly got its issues like any other place. They're also my employer, Marc's giving me some interesting looks. He wants me to get a little more vocal. Marc Andreessen: I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I mean, one of the things about being a researcher at a big institution like Stanford is, well, first of all, it meets the criteria that you described. Know, you look to the left, you look to the right or anywhere above or below you, and you have excellence. Right? I mean, I've got a Nobel Prize winner below me whose daddy also won a Nobel Prize, and his scientific offspring is likely to win. I mean, it inspires you to do bigger things than one ordinarily would, no matter what. So there's that, and that's great. And that persists. There's all the bureaucratic red tape about trying to get things done and how to implement decisions is very hard, and there are a lot of reasons for that. And then, of course, there are the things that many people are aware of. There are public accusations about people in positions of great leadership, and that's getting played out. And the whole thing becomes kind of overwhelming and a little bit opaque when you're just trying to run your lab or live your life. And so I think one of the reasons for this lack of reform that you're referring to is because there's no position of reformer, right? So deans are dealing with a lot of issues. Provosts are dealing with a lot of issues. Presidents are dealing with a lot of issues, and then some in some cases. And so we don't have a dedicated role of reformer, someone to go in and say, listen, there's just a lot of fat on this and we need to trim it or we need to create this or do that. There just isn't a system to do that. And that's, I think in part, because universities are built on old systems, and it's like the New York subway. It's amazing i t still works as well as it does, and yet it's got a ton of problems also. Marc Andreessen: So the point, we could debate the university specifically, but the point is like, look, if you do think institutions are going bad, and then you have to make it number one. You have to figure out if you think institutions are going bad. The population largely does think that at the very least, the people who run institutions ought to really think hard about what that means. Andrew Huberman: But people still strive to go to these places. And I still hear from people who, for instance, did not go to college, are talking about how a university degree is useless. They'll tell you how proud they are that their son or daughter is going to Stanford or is going to UCLA or is going to Urbana Champaign. I mean, it's almost like, to me, that's always the most shocking contradiction, is like, these institutions don't matter. But then when people want to hold up a card that says why their kid is great, it's not about how many pushups they can do or that they started their own business. Most of the time it's they're going to this university. And I think, well, what's going on here? Marc Andreessen: So do you think the median voter in the United States can have their kid go to Stanford? Andrew Huberman: No. Marc Andreessen: Do you think the median voter in the United States could have their kid admitted to Stanford, even with a perfect SAT? Andrew Huberman: No, no. In this day and age, the competition is so fierce that it requires more. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So first of all, again, we're dealing here. Yes. We're dealing with a small number of very elite institutions. People may admire them or not. Most people have no connectivity to them whatsoever. In the statistics, in the polling, universities are not doing well. The population at large, yeah, they may have fantasies about their kid going to Stanford, but the reality of it is they have a very collapsing view of these institutions. So anyway, this actually goes straight to the question of alternatives then, right? Which is like, okay, if you believe that there's collapsing faith in the institutions, if you believe that it is merited, at least in some ways, if you believe that reform is effectively impossible, then you are faced... We could debate each of those, but the population at large seems to believe a lot of that. Then there's a question of like, okay, can it be replaced? And if so, are you better off replacing these things basically, while the old things still exist? Or do you actually need to basically clear the field to be able to have the new thing exist? The universities are a great case study of this because of how student loans work, right? And the way student loans work is to be an actual competitive university and compete, you need to have access to federal student lending. Because if you don't, everybody has to pay out of pocket. And it's completely out of reach for anybody other than a certain class of either extremely rich or foreign students. So you need access to a federal student loan facility. To get access to a federal student loan facility, you need to be an accredited university. Guess who runs the accreditation council? Andrew Huberman: I don't know. Marc Andreessen: The existing universities, right? So it's a self laundering machine. Like they decide who the new universities are. Guess how many new universities get accredited, each year to be able... Andrew Huberman: Zero. Marc Andreessen: Zero, right? And so as long as that system is in place, and as long as they have the government wired the way that they do, and as long as they control who gets access to federal student loan funding, of course there's not going to be any competition. Of course there can't be a new institution that's going to be able to get to scale. It's not, not possible. And so if you actually wanted to create a new system that was better in, you know, I would argue dozens or hundreds of ways, it could obviously be better if you were starting it today. It probably can't be done as long as the existing institutions are actually intact. And this is my counter to Martin, which is like, yeah, look, if we're going to tear down the old, there may be a period of disruption before we get to the new, but we're never going to get to the new if we don't tear down the old. Andrew Huberman: When you say counter to Martin, you're talking about the author of Revolt of the Public ? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, Martin Gurri. What Martin Gurri says is like, look, he said basically as follows, the elites deserve contempt, but the only thing worse than these elites that deserve contempt would be no elites at all. And he basically says on the other side of the destruction of the elites and the institutions is nihilism. You're basically left with nothing. And by the way, there is a nihilistic streak. I mean, there's a nihilistic streak in the culture and the politics today. There are people who basically would just say, yeah, just tear the whole system down without any particular plan for what follows. And so I think he makes a good point and that you want to be careful that you actually have a plan on the other side that you think is actually achievable. But again, the counterargument to that is if you're not willing to actually tear down the old, you're not going to get to the new. Now, what's interesting, of course, is this is what happens every day in business, right? So the entire way, how do you know that the capitalist system works? The way that you know is that the old companies, when they're no longer like the best at what they do, they get torn down and then they ultimately die and they get replaced by better companies. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I haven't seen a Sears in a while. Marc Andreessen: Exactly. And we know what's so interesting is we know in capitalism, in a market economy, we know that's the sign of health, that's the sign of how the system is working properly. And in fact, we get actually judged by antitrust authorities in the government on that basis. It's like the best defense against antitrust charges is no, people are coming to kill us and they're doing a really good job of it. That's how we know we're doing our job. And in fact, in business we are specifically, it is specifically illegal for companies in the same industry to get together and plot and conspire and plan and have things like these accreditation bureaus. If I created the equivalent in my companies of the kind of accreditation bureau that the universities have, I'd get sent straight to federal prison and a trust violation Sherman Act. Straight to prison. People have been sent to prison for that. So in the business world, we know that you want everything subject to market competition. We know that you want creative destruction. We know that you want replacement of the old with superior new. It's just once we get outside of business, we're like, oh, we don't want any of that. We want basically stagnation and log rolling and basically institutional incestuous, like entanglements and conflicts of interest as far as the eye can see, and then we're surprised by the results. Andrew Huberman: So let's play it out as a bit of a thought experiment. So let's say that one small banding together of people who want to start a new university where there is free exchange of open ideas, where unless somebody has egregious behavior, violent behavior, truly sexually inappropriate behavior against somebody that is committing a crime, they're allowed to be there. They're allowed to be a student or a faculty member or administrator. And let's just say this accreditation bureau allowed student loans for this one particular university. Or let's say that there was an independent source of funding for that university such that students could just apply there. They didn't need to be part of this elite, accredited group, which sounds very mafia-like, frankly, not necessarily violent, but certainly coercive in the way that it walls people out. Let's say that then there were 20 or 30 of those or 40 of those. Do you think that over time, that model would overtake the existing model? Marc Andreessen: Isn't it interesting that those don't exist? Remember Sherlock Holmes, The Dog that Didn't Bark ? Andrew Huberman: It is interesting that they don't exist. Marc Andreessen: Right. So there's two possibilities. One is like, nobody wants that, which I don't believe. And then the other is like, the system is wired in a way that will just simply not allow it. And you did a hypothetical in which the system would allow it. And my response to that is, no, of course the system won't allow that. Andrew Huberman: Or the people that band together have enough money or get enough resources to say, look, we can afford to give loans to 10,000 students per year. 10,000 isn't a trivial number when thinking about the size of a university. And most of them hopefully will graduate in four years and there'll be a turnover. Do you think that the great future innovators would tend to orient toward that model more than they currently do toward the traditional model? What I'm trying to get back to here is how do you think that the current model thwarts innovation, as well as maybe some ways that it still supports innovation? Certainly cancellation and the risk of cancellation from the way that we framed it earlier, is going to discourage risk takers of the category of risk takers that take risk in every domain that really like to fly close to the sun and sometimes into the sun or are-- Marc Andreessen: --Doing research that is just not politically palatable. Andrew Huberman: Right, that we can't even talk about on this podcast, probably without causing a distraction of what we're actually trying to talk about. Marc Andreessen: That gives up the whole game right there. Exactly. Andrew Huberman: I keep a file, and it's a written file because I'm afraid to put it into electronic form of all the things that I'm afraid to talk about publicly because I come from a lineage of advisors where all three died young, and I figure, if nothing else, I'll die, and then I'll make it into the world and let's say 510 years, 20 years, and if not, I know a certainty I'm going to die at some point, and then we'll see where all those issues stand. In any event-- Marc Andreessen: --is that list getting l onger over time or shorter? Andrew Huberman: Oh, it's definitely getting longer. Marc Andreessen: Isn't that interesting? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, it's getting much longer. I mean, there are just so many issues that I would love to explore on this podcast with experts and that I can't explore, just even if I had a panel of them, because of the way that things get soundbited and segmented out and taken out of context, it's like the whole conversation is lost. And so, unfortunately, there are an immense number of equally interesting conversations that I'm excited to have, but it is a little disturbing. Marc Andreessen: Do you remember Lysenkoism? Andrew Huberman: No. Marc Andreessen: Famous in the history of the Soviet Union. This is the famous thing. So there was a geneticist named Lysenko. Andrew Huberman: That's why it sounds familiar, but I'm not calling to-- Marc Andreessen: --Well, he was the guy who did communist genetics, the field of genetics, the Soviets did not approve of the field of genetics because, of course, they believed in the creation of the new man and total equality, and genetics did not support that. And so if you were doing traditional genetics, you were going to know, at the very least be fired, if not killed. And so this guy Lysenko stood up and said, oh, I've got Marxist genetics, right? I've got, like a whole new field of genetics that basically is politically compliant. And then they actually implemented that in the agriculture system of the Soviet Union. And it's the origin of one of the big reasons that the Soviet Union actually fell, which was they ultimately couldn't feed themselves. Andrew Huberman: So create a new notion of biology as it relates to genetics. Marc Andreessen: Politically correct biology, right? They not only created it, they taught it, they mandated it, they required it, and then they implemented it in agriculture. Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Marc Andreessen: I never understood. There was a bunch of things in history I never understood until the last decade, and that's one of them. Andrew Huberman: Well, I censor myself at the level of deleting certain things, but I don't contort what I do talk about. So I tend to like to play on lush, open fields. Just makes my life a lot easier. Marc Andreessen: But this goes to the rot. This goes to the rot, and I'll come back to your question, but this goes to the rot in the existing system, which is, by the way, I'm no different. I'm just like you. Like, I'm trying not to light myself on fire either. But the rot in the existing system, and by system, I mean the institutions and the elites, the rot is that the set of things that are no longer allowed. I mean, that list is obviously expanding over time, and that's real, historically speaking, that doesn't end in good places. Andrew Huberman: Is this group of a particular generation that we can look forward to the time when they eventually die off. Marc Andreessen: It's a third of the Boomers plus the Millennials. Andrew Huberman: So, got a while. Marc Andreessen: Good news, bad news. Gen X is weird, right? I'm Gen X. Gen X is weird because we kind of slipped in the middle. We were kind of the, I don't know how to describe it. We were the kind of non-political generation kind of sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials. Gen Z is a very, I think, open question right now which way they go. I could imagine them being actually much more intense than the Millennials on all these issues. I could also imagine them reacting to the Millennials and being far more open minded. Andrew Huberman: We don't know which way it's going to go. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, it's going to go. It might be different groups of them. Andrew Huberman: I'm Gen X also, I'm 47, you're...? Marc Andreessen: 52. Andrew Huberman: So I grew up with some John Hughes films and so where the jocks and the hippies and the punks, and were all divided and they were all segmented, but then it all sort of mishmashed together a few years later. And I think that had a lot to do with, like you said, the sort of apolitical aspect of our generation. Marc Andreessen: The Gen X just knew the Boomers were nuts, right? Like, one of the great sitcoms of the era was Family Ties , right? With the character Michael P. Keaton. And he was just like, this guy is just like, yeah, my Boomer hippie parents are crazy. I'm just going to go into business and actually do something productive. There was something iconic about that character in our culture. And people like me were like, yeah, obviously you go into business, you don't go into political activism. And then it's just like, man, that came whipping back around with the next generation. So just to touch real quick on the university thing. So, look, there are people trying to do, and I'm actually going to do a thing this afternoon with the University of Austin, which is one of these. And so there are people trying to do new universities. Like, I would say it's certainly possible. I hope they succeed. I'm pulling for them. I think it'd be great. I think it'd be great if there w ere a lot more of them. Andrew Huberman: Who founded this university? Marc Andreessen: This is a whole group of people. I don't want to freelance on that because I don't know originally who the idea was-- Andrew Huberman: --University of Austin, not UT Austin. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So this is not UT Austin. It's called the University of Austin. Or they call it. I think it's UATX? And it's a lot of very sharp people associated with it. They're going to try, very much exactly like what you described. They're going to try to do a new one. I would just tell you the wall of opposition that they're up against is profound. And part of it is economic, which is can they ever get access to federal student lending? And I hope that they can, but it seems nearly inconceivable the way the system is rigged today. And then the other is just like they already have come under, I mean, anybody who publicly associates with them who is in traditional academia immediately gets lit on fire, and there's, you know, cancellation campaigns. So they're up against a wall of social ostracism. Andrew Huberman: Wow. Marc Andreessen: They're up against a wall of press attacks. They're up against a wall of people just like doing the thing, pouncing on, anytime anybody says anything, they're going to try to burn the place down. Andrew Huberman: This reminds me of Jerry Springer episodes and Geraldo Rivera episodes where it's like if a teen listened to Danzig or Marilyn Manson type music or Metallica, that they were considered a devil worshiper. Now we just laugh, right? We're like, that's crazy, right? People listen to music with all sorts of lyrics and ideas and looks. That's crazy. But there were people legitimately sent to prison. I think it was a West Memphis three, right? These kids out in West Memphis that looked different, acted different, were accused of murders that eventually was made clear they clearly didn't commit, but they were in prison because of the music they listened to. I mean, this sounds very similar to that. And I remember seeing bumpersickers, Free the West Memphis Three! And I thought this was some crazy thing. And you look into it and this isn't, it's a little bit niche, but these are real lives. And there was an active witch hunt for people that looked different and acted different. And yet now we're sort of in this inverted world where on the one hand we're all told that we can express ourselves however we want, but on the other hand, you can't get a bunch of people together to take classes where they learn biology and sociology and econ in Texas. Wild. Marc Andreessen: Yes. Well, so the simple explanation is this is Puritanism, right? So this is the original American Puritanism that just works itself out through the system in different ways at different times. There's a religious phenomenon in America called the Great Awakenings. There will be these periods in American history where there's basically religiosity fades and then there will be this snapback effect where you'll have basically this frenzy basically, of religion. In the old days, it would have been tent revivals and people speaking in tongues and all this stuff. And then in the modern world, it's of the form that we're living through right now. And so, yeah, it's just basically these waves of sort of American religious, and remember, religion in our time, religious impulses in our time don't get expressed because we live in more advanced times. We live in scientifically informed times. And so religious impulses in our time don't show up as overtly religious. They show up in a secularized form, which, of course, conveniently, is therefore not subject to the First Amendment separation of church and state. As long as the church is secular, there's no problem. But we're acting out these kind of religious scripts over and over again, and we're in the middle of another religious frenzy. Andrew Huberman: There's a phrase that I hear a lot, and I don't necessarily believe it, but I want your thoughts on it, which is, "the pendulum always swings back." Marc Andreessen: Yeah, not quite. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: So that's how I feel, too, because-- Marc Andreessen: --Boy, that would be great. Andrew Huberman: Take any number of things that we've talked about, and, gosh, it's so crazy the way things have gone with institutions, or it's so crazy the way things have gone with social media, or it's so crazy, fill in the blank and people will say, well, the pendulum always swings back like it's the stock market or something. After every crash, there'll be an eventual boom and vice versa. Marc Andreessen: By the way, that's not true either. Most stock markets we have are, of course, survivorship. It's all survivorship. Everything is survivor. Everything you just said is obviously survivorship bias. Right. So if you look globally, most stock markets, over time crash and burn and never recover. The American stock market hasn't always recovered. Andrew Huberman: I was referring to the American stock market. Marc Andreessen: Globally, b ut the reason everybody refers to the American stock market is because it's the one that doesn't do that, the other 200 or whatever, crash and burn and never recover. Let's go check in on the Argentina stock market right now. I don't think it's coming back anytime soon. Andrew Huberman: My father is Argentine and immigrated to the US in the 1960s, so he would definitely agree with you. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. When their stocks crash, they don't come back. And then Lysenkoism, like, the Soviet Union never recovered from Lysenkoism, it never came back. It led to the end of the country, you know, literally. The things that took down the Soviet Union were oil and wheat. And the wheat thing, you can trace the crisis back to Lysenkoism. No, look, pendulum swings back is true only in the cases where the pendulum swings back, everybody just conveniently forgets all the other circumstances where that doesn't happen. One of the things people, you see this in business also, people have a really hard time confronting really bad news. I don't know if you've noticed that. I think every doctor who's listening right now is like, yeah, no shit. But have you seen in business, there are situations, that Star Trek , remember Star Trek ? The Kobayashi Maru simulator, right? So the big lesson to become a Star Trek captain is you had to go through the simulation called the Kobayashi Maru, and the point was, there's no way to win. It's a no win scenario. And then it turned out like, Captain Kirk was the only person to ever win the scenario. And the way that he did it was he went in ahead of time and hacked the simulator. It was the only way to actually get through. And then there was a debate whether to fire him or make him a captain. So they made him a captain. You know, the problem is, in real life, you do get the Kobayashi Maru on a regular basis. Like, there are actual no win situations that you can't work your way out of. And as a leader, you can't ever cop to that, right? Because you have to carry things forward, and you have to look for every possible choice you can. But every once in a while, you do run into a situation where it's really not recoverable. And at least I've found people just cannot cope with that. What happens is they basically, then they basically just exclude it from their memory that it ever happened. Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up simulators, because I want to make sure that we talk about the new and emerging landscape of AI artificial intelligence. And I could try and smooth our conversation of a moment ago with this one by creating some clever segue, but I'm not going to, except I'm going to ask, is there a possibility that AI is going to remedy some of what we're talking about? Let's make sure that we earmark that for discussion a little bit later. But first off, because some of the listeners of this podcast might not be as familiar with AI as perhaps they should be. We've all heard about artificial intelligence. People hear about machine learning, etc. But it'd be great if you could define for us what AI is. People almost immediately hear AI and think, okay, robots taking over. I'm going to wake up, and I'm going to be strapped to the bed and my organs are going to be pulled out of me. The robots are going to be in my bank account. They're going to kill all my children and dystopia for most. Clearly, that's not the way it's going to go if you believe that machines can augment human intelligence, and human intelligence is a good thing. So tell us what AI is and where you think it can take us, both good and bad. Marc Andreessen: So, there was a big debate when the computer was first invented, which is in the 1930s, 1940s, people like Alan Turing and John von Neumann and these people. And the big debate at the time was because they knew they wanted to build computers. They had the basic idea, and there had been, like, calculating machines before that, and there had been these looms that you basically programmed to punch cards. And so there was a prehistory to computers that had to do with building sort of increasingly complex calculating machines. So they were kind of on a track, but they knew they were going to be able to build, they called it a general purpose computer that could basically, you could program, in the way that you program computers today. But they had a big debate early on, which is, should the fundamental architecture of the computer be based on either A, like calculating machines, like cache registers and looms and other things like that, or should it be based on a model of the human brain? And they actually had this idea of computers modeled on the human brain back then, and this is this concept of so called neural networks. And it's actually fairly astonishing from a research standpoint. The original paper on neural networks actually was published in 1943. So they didn't have our level of neuroscience, but they actually knew about the neuron, and they actually had a theory of neurons interconnecting and synapses and information processing in the brain even back then. And a lot of people at the time basically said, you know what? We should basically have the computer from the start be modeled after the human brain, because if the computer could do everything that the human brain can do, that would be the best possible general purpose computer. And then you could have it do jobs, and you could have it create art, and you could have it do all kinds of things like humans can do. It turns out that didn't happen. In our world, what happened instead was the industry went in the other direction. It went basically in the model of the calculating machine or the cash register. And I think, practically speaking, that kind of had to be the case, because that was actually the technology that was practical at the time. But that's the path and so what we all have experiences with, up to and including the iPhone in our pocket, is computers built on that basically calculating machine model, not the human brain model. And so what that means is computers, as we have come to understand them, they're basically like mathematical savants at best. So they're really good at doing lots of mathematical calculations. They're really good at executing these extremely detailed computer programs. They're hyper literal. One of the things you learn early when you're a programmer is, as the human programmer, you have to get every single instruction you give the computer correct because it will do exactly what you tell it to do. And bugs in computer programs are always a mistake on the part of the programmer. Interesting. You never blame the computer. You always blame the programmer because that's the nature of the thing that you're dealing with. Andrew Huberman: One downscore off and the whole thing-- Marc Andreessen: --Yeah, and it's the programmer's fault. And if you talk to any programmer, they'll agree with this. They'll be like, yeah, if there's a problem, it's my fault. I did it. I can't blame the computer. The computer has no judgment. It has no ability to interpret, synthesize, develop an independent understanding of anything. It's literally just doing what I tell it to do step by step. So for 80 years we've had this, just this very kind of hyper literal kind of model computers. Technically, these are what are called von Neumann machines, based after the mathematician John von Neumann. They run in that way, and they've been very successful and very important, and our world has been shaped by them. But there was always this other idea out there, which is, okay, how about a completely different approach, which is based much more on how the human brain operates, or at least our kind of best understanding of how the human brain operates, right? Because those aren't the same thing. It basically says, okay, what if you could have a computer instead of being hyper literal? What if you could have it actually be conceptual and creative and able to synthesize information and able to draw judgments and able to behave in ways that are not deterministic but are rather creative? And the applications for this, of course, are endless. And so, for example, the self-driving car, the only way that you cannot program a computer with rules to make it a self-driving car, you have to do what Tesla and Waymo and these other companies have done. Now you have to use, right, you have to use this other architecture, and you have to basically teach them how to recognize objects in images at high speeds, basically the same way the human brain does. And so those are so called neural networks running inside. Andrew Huberman: So, essentially, let the machine operate based on priors. We almost clipped a boulder going up this particular drive, and so therefore, this shape that previously the machine didn't recognize as a boulder, it now introduces to its catalog of boulders. Is that a good example? Marc Andreessen: Let's even make it even starker for a self-driving car. There's something in the road. Is it a small child or a plastic shopping bag being blown by the wind? Very important difference. If it's a shopping bag, you definitely want to go straight through it, because if you deviate off course, you're going to make a fast, it's the same challenge we have when we're driving. You don't want to swerve to avoid a shopping bag because you might hit something that you didn't see on the side. But if it's a small child for sure you want to swerve, right? But in that moment, small children come in different shapes and descriptions and are wearing different kinds of clothes. Andrew Huberman: They might tumble onto the road the same way a bag would tumble. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, they might look like they're tumbling. And by the way, they might be wearing a Halloween mask. Right. They might not have a recognizable human face. It might be a kid with one leg. You definitely want to not hit those. This is what basically we figured out is you can't apply the rules based approach of a Von Neumann machine to basically real life and expect the computer to be in any way understanding or resilient, to change to basically things happening in real life. And this is why there's always been such a stark divide between what the machine can do and what the human can do. And so, basically, what's happened is in the last decade, that second type of computer, the neural network based computer, has started to actually work. It started to work, actually, first, interestingly, in vision, recognizing objects and images, which is why the self-driving car is starting to work. Andrew Huberman: Face recognition. Marc Andreessen: Face recognition. Andrew Huberman: I mean, when I started off in visual neuroscience, which is really my original home in neuroscience, the idea that a computer or a camera could do face recognition better than a human was like a very low probability event based on the technology we had at the time, based on the understanding of the face recognition cells and the fusiform gyrus. Now, you would be smartest to put all your money on the machine. You want to find faces in airports, even with masks on and at profile versus straight on, machines can do it far better than almost all people. I mean, they're the super recognizers. But even they can't match the best machines. Now, ten years ago, what I just said was the exact reverse, right? Marc Andreessen: That's right, yeah. So faces, handwriting, and then voice, being able to understand voice just as a user. If you use Google Docs, it has a built-in voice transcription. They have sort of the best industry leading kind of voice transcription. If you use a voice transcription in Google Docs, it's breathtakingly good. You just speak into it and it just types what you're saying. Andrew Huberman: Well, that's good, because in my phone, every once in a while, I'll say I need to go pick up a f ew things and it'll say, I need to pick up a few thongs. And so Apple needs to get on board. Whatever the voice recognition is that Google's using-- Marc Andreessen: --Maybe it knows you better than you think. Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] That was not the topic I was avoiding discussing. Marc Andreessen: No. So that's on the list, right? That's on your... Actually, there's a reason, actually, why Google's so good and Apple is not right now at that kind of thing. And it actually goes to actually an ideological thing, of all things. Apple does not permit pooling of data for any purpose, including training AI, whereas Google does. And Apple's just like, stake their brand on privacy. And among that is sort of a pledge that they don't pool your data. And so all of Apple's AI is like, AI that has to happen locally on your phone. Whereas Google's AI can happen in the cloud. Right? It can happen across pool data. Now, by the way, some people think that that's bad because they think pooling data is bad. But that's an example of the shift that's happening in the industry right now, which is you have this separation between the people who are embracing the new way of training AIs and the people who basically, for whatever reason, are not. Andrew Huberman: Excuse me, you say that some people think it's bad because of privacy issues or they think it's bad because of the reduced functionality of that AI. Marc Andreessen: Oh, no. So you're definitely going to get... there's three reasons AIs have started to work. One of them is just simply larger data sets, larger amounts of data. Specifically, the reason why objects and images are now, the reason machines are now better than humans at recognizing objects, images or recognizing faces is because modern facial recognition AIs are trained across all photos on the Internet of people. Billions and billions and billions of photos, right? Unlimited number of photos of people on the Internet. Attempts to train facial recognition systems. Ten or 20 years ago, they'd be trained on thousands or tens of thousands of photos. Andrew Huberman: So the input data is simply much m ore vast . Marc Andreessen: Much larger. This is the reason to get to the conclusion on this. This is the reason why ChatGPT works so well. One of the reasons ChatGPT works so well is it's trained on the entire Internet of text. And the entire Internet of text was not something that was available for you to train an AI on until it came to actually exist itself, which is new in the last, basically decade. Andrew Huberman: So in the case of face recognition, I could see how having a much larger input data set would be beneficial if the goal is to recognize Marc Andreessen's face, because you are looking for signal to noise against everything else, right? But in the case of ChatGPT, when you're pooling all text on the internet and you ask ChatGPT to, say, construct a paragraph about Marc Andreessen's prediction of the future of human beings over the next ten years and the likely to be most successful industries, give ChatGPT that. If it's pooling across all text, how does it know what is authentically Marc Andreessen's text? Because in the case of face recognition, you've got a standard to work from a verified image versus everything else. In the case of text, you have to make sure that what you're starting with is verified text from your mouth, which makes sense if it's coming from video. But then if that video is deep faked, all of a sudden, what's true? Your valid Marc Andreessen is in question. And then everything ChatGPT is producing, that is then of question. Marc Andreessen: So I would say there's a before and after thing here. There's like a before ChatGPT and after GPT question, because the existence of GPT itself changes the answer. So before ChatGPT. So the version you're using today is trained on data up till September 2021. They're cut off with the training set. Up till September 2021, almost all text on the Internet was written by a human being. And then most of that was written by people under their own names. Some of it wasn't, but a lot of it was. And why do you know it's for me is because it was published in a magazine under my name, or it's a podcast transcript and it's under my name. And generally speaking, if you just did a search on what are things Marc Andreessen has written and said, 90% plus of that would be correct, and somebody might have written a fake parody article or something. Like that. But not that many people were spending that much time writing fake articles about things that I said. Andrew Huberman: Right now, so many people can pretend to be you. Marc Andreessen: Exactly right. And so, generally speaking, you can kind of get your arms around the idea that there's a corpus of material associated with me. Or by the way, same thing with you. There's a corpus of YouTube transcripts and other, your academic papers and talks you've given, and you can kind of get your hands around that. And that's how these systems are trained. They take all that data collectively, they put it in there. And that's why this works as well as it does. And that's why if you ask ChatGPT to speak or write like me or like you or like somebody else, it will actually generally do a really good job because it has all of our prior text in its training data. That said, from here on out, this gets harder. And of course, the reason this gets harder is because now we have AI that can create text and we have AI that can create text at industrial scale. Andrew Huberman: Is it watermarked as AI generated text? Marc Andreessen: No. Andrew Huberman: How hard would it be to do that? Marc Andreessen: I think it's impossible. I think it's impossible. There are people who are trying to do that. This is a hot topic in the classroom. I was just talking to a friend who's got like a 14 year old kid in a class, and there's like these recurring scandals. Every kid in the class is using ChatGPT to write their essays or to help them write their essays, and then the teacher is using one of, there's a tool that you can use that purports to be able to tell you whether something was written by ChatGPT. But it's like, only right like 60% of the time. And so there was this case where the student wrote an essay where their parent sat and watched them write the essay, and then they submitted it, and this tool got the conclusion incorrect. And then the student feels outraged because he got unfairly cheated. But the teacher is like, well, you're all using the tool. Then it turns out there's another tool that basically you feed in text, and they call it a summarizer. But what it really is is it's a cheating mechanism to basically just shuffle the words around enough so that it sheds whatever characteristics were associated with AI. So, there's like an arms race going on in educational settings right now around this exact question. I don't think it's possible to do. There are people working on the watermarking. I don't think it's possible to do the watermarking. And I think it's just kind of obvious why it's not possible to do that, which is you can just read the output for yourself. It's really good. How are you actually going to tell the difference between that and something that a real person wrote? And then, by the way, you can also ask ChatGPT to write in different styles, right? So you can tell it, like, write in the style of a 15 year old. You can tell it to write in the style of a non native English speaker. Or if you're a non native English speaker, you can tell it to write in the style of an English speaker, native English speaker. And so the tool itself will help you evade. I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to distinguish, "real" versus fake. I think those days are over. Andrew Huberman: Genie's out of the bottle. Marc Andreessen: Genie is completely out of the bottle. And by the way, I actually think this is good. This doesn't map to my worldview of how we use this technology anyway, which we can come back to. So there's that, and then there's the problem, therefore of the so-called deep fake problem. So then there's the problem of, like, deliberate basically, manipulation. And that's like one of your many enemies, one of your increasingly long list of enemies like mine, who basically is like, wow, I know how I'm going to get him, right? I'm going to use it to create something that looks like a Huberman transcript and I'm going to have him say all these bad things. Andrew Huberman: Or a video. Marc Andreessen: Or a video, or a video. Andrew Huberman: I mean, Joe Rogan and I were deep faked in a video. I don't want to flag people to it, so I won't talk about what it was about, but where it, for all the world looked like a conversation that we were having and we never had that specific conversation. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right. So that's going to happen for sure. So what there's going to need to be is there need to be basically registries where basically in your case, you will submit your legitimate content into a registry under your unique cryptographic key, right. And then basically there will be a way to check against that registry to see whether that was the real thing. And I think this needs to be done for sure. For public figures, it needs to be done for politicians, it needs to be done for music. Andrew Huberman: What about taking what's already out there and being able to authenticate it or not in the same way that many times per week, I get asked, is this your account about a direct message that somebody got on Instagram? And I always tell them, look, I only have the one account, this one verified account. Although now, with the advent of pay to play, verification makes it a little less potent as a security blanket for knowing if it's not this account, then it's not me. But in any case, these accounts pop up all the time pretending to be me. And I'm relatively low on the scale. Not low, but relatively low on the scale to say, like a Beyonce or something like that, who has hundreds of millions of followers. So is there a system in mind where people could go in and verify text, click yes or no. This is me. This is not me. And even there, there's the opportunity for people to fudge, to eliminate things about themselves that they don't want out there, by saying, no, that's not me. I didn't actually say that. Or create that. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, no, that's right. Technologically, it's actually pretty straightforward. So the way to implement this technologically is with a public key. It's called public key cryptography, which is the basis for how cryptography information is secured in the world today. And so basically, the implementation form of this would be, you would pick whatever is your most trusted channel, and let's say it's your YouTube channel as an example, where just everybody just knows that it's you on your YouTube channel because you've been doing it for ten years or whatever, and it's just obvious. And you would just publish in the about me page on YouTube, you would just publish your public cryptographic key that's unique to you. Right. And then anytime anybody wants to check to see whether any piece of content is actually you, they go to a registry in the cloud somewhere, and they basically submit. They basically say, okay, is this him? And then they can basically see whether somebody with your public key, you had actually certified that this was something that you made. Now, who runs that registry is an interesting question. If that registry is run by the government, we will call that the Ministry of Truth. I think that's probably a bad idea. If that registry is run by a company, we would call that basically the equivalent of, like, a credit bureau or something like that. Maybe that's how it happens. The problem with that is that company now becomes hacking target number one, right, of every bad person on Earth. Because if anybody breaks into that company, they can fake all kinds of things. Andrew Huberman: They own the truth. Marc Andreessen: Right. They own the truth. And by the way, insider threat, also, their employees can monkey with it. So you have to really trust that company. The third way to do it is with a blockchain. And so this, with the crypto blockchain technology, you could have a distributed system, basically, a distributed database in the cloud that is run through a blockchain. And then it implements this cryptography and this certification process. Andrew Huberman: What about quantum Internet? Is that another way to encrypt these things? I know most of our listeners are probably not familiar with quantum Internet, but put simply, it's a way to secure communications on the Internet. Let's just leave it at that. It's sophisticated, and we'll probably do a whole episode about this at some point. But maybe you have a succinct way of describing quantum Internet, but that would be better. And if so, please offer it up. But is quantum Internet going to be one way to secure these kinds of data and resources? Marc Andreessen: Maybe in the future, years in the future? We don't yet have working quantum computers in practice, so it's not currently something you could do, but maybe in a decade or two? Andrew Huberman: Tell me. I'm going to take a stab at defining quantum Internet in one sentence. It's a way in which if anyone were to try and peer in on a conversation on the Internet, it essentially would be futile because of the way that quantum Internet changes the way that the communication is happening so fast and so many times in any one conversation, essentially changing the translation or the language so fast that there's just no way to keep up with it. Is that more or less accurate? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, conceivably not yet, but someday. Andrew Huberman: So, going back to AI, most people who hear about AI are afraid of AI. Marc Andreessen: Well? Andrew Huberman: I think most people who aren't informed-- Marc Andreessen: --This goes back to our elites versus masses thing. Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. Well, I heard you say that, a his is from a really wonderful tweet thread that we will link in the show note captions that you put out not long ago and that I've read now several times, and that everyone really should take the time to read it. Probably takes about 20 minutes to read it carefully and to think about each piece, and I highly recommend it. But you said, and I'm quoting here, "Let's address the fifth, the one thing I actually agree with, which is AI will make it easier for bad people to do bad things." Marc Andreessen: First of all, there is a general freak out happening around AI. I think it's primarily, it's one of these, again, it's an elite driven freak out. I don't think the man in the street knows, cares, or feels one way or the other. It's just not a relevant concept, and it probably just sounds like science fiction. So I think there's an elite driven freak out that's happening right now. I think that elite driven freak out has many aspects to it that I think are incorrect, which is not surprising. I would think that, given that. I think the elites are incorrect about a lot of things, but I think they're very wrong about a number of things they're saying about AI. But that said, look, this is a very powerful new technology, right? This is like a new general purpose thinking technology. So what if machines could think? And what if you could use machines that think, and what if you could have them think for you? There's obviously a lot of good that could come from that. But also, people, look, criminals could use them to plan better crimes. Terrorists could use them to plan better terror attacks and so forth. And so these are going to be tools that bad people can use to do bad things, for sure. Andrew Huberman: I can think of some ways that AI could be leveraged to do fantastic things. Like in the realm of medicine, an AI pathologist perhaps, can scan 10,000 slides of histology and find the one micro tumor, cellular aberration, that would turn into a full blown tumor, whereas the even mildly fatigued or well rested human pathologists, as great as they come, might miss that. And perhaps the best solution is for both of them to do it, and then for the human to verify what the AI has found and vice versa, right? Marc Andreessen: That's right. Andrew Huberman: And that's just one example. I mean, I can come up with thousands of examples where this would be wonderful. Marc Andreessen: I'll give you another one, by the way, medicine. So you're talking about an analytic result, which is good and important. The other is like, the machines are going to be much better at bedside manner. They're going to be much better at dealing with the patient. And we already know there's already been a study. There's already been a study on this. So there was already a study done on this where there was a study team that scraped thousands of medical questions off of an Internet forum, and then they had real doctors answer the questions, and then they had basically GPT4 answer the questions, and then they had another panel of doctors score the responses. So there were no patients experimented on here. This was a test contained within the medical world. The judges, the panel of doctors who are the judges, scored the answers in both factual accuracy and on bedside manner, on empathy. And the GPT4 was equal or better on most of the factual questions analytically, already, and it's not even a specifically trained medical AI, but it was overwhelmingly better on empathy. Andrew Huberman: Amazing, Marc Andreessen: Right? Do you treat patients directly in your work? You don't? Andrew Huberman: No, I don't. We run clinical trials. Marc Andreessen: Right. Andrew Huberman: But I don't do any direct clinical work. Marc Andreessen: I've no direct experience with this. But from the surgeons, if you talk to surgeons or you talk to people who train surgeons, what they'll tell you is surgeons need to have an emotional remove from their patients in order to do a good job with the surgery. The side effect of that, and by the way, look, it's a hell of a job to have to go in and tell somebody that they're going to die or that they have so you're never going to recover, they're never going to walk again or whatever it is. And so there's sort of something inherent in that job where they need to keep an emotional reserve from the patient to be able to do the job. And it's expected of them as professionals. The machine has no such limitation. The machine can be as sympathetic as you want it to be for as long as you want it to be. It can be infinitely sympathetic. It's happy to talk to you at four in the morning. It's happy to sympathize with you. And by the way, it's not just sympathizing with you in the way that, oh, it's just making up words to lie to you to make you feel good. It can also sympathize with you in terms of helping you through all the things that you can actually do to improve your situation. And so, boy, can you keep a patient actually on track with a physical therapy program. Can you keep a patient on track with a nutritional program? Can you keep a patient off of drugs or alcohol? And if they have a machine medical companion that's with them all the time that they're talking to all the time, that's infinitely patient, infinitely wise, infinitely loving, and it's just going to be there all the time and it's going to be encouraging and it's going to be, you know, you did such a great job yesterday, I know you can do this again today. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an obvious fit here. These things are going to be great at CBT and that's already starting. You can already use ChatGPT as a CBT therapist if you want. It's actually quite good at it. There's, there's a universe here that's, it goes to what you said, there's a universe here that's opening up, which is what I believe is it's partnership between man and machine. It's a symbiotic relationship, not an adversarial relationship. And so the doctor is going to pair with the AI to do all the things that you described, but the patient is also going to pair with the AI. And I think this partnership that's going to emerge is going to lead, among other things, to actually much better health outcomes. Andrew Huberman: I've relied for so much of my life on excellent mentors from a very young age, and still now, in order to make the best decisions possible with the information I had, and rarely were they available at four in the morning sometimes, but not on a frequent basis. And they fatigue like anybody else, and they have their own stuff like anybody else, baggage, events in their life, etc. What you're describing is a sort of AI coach or therapist of sorts, that hopefully would learn to identify our best self and encourage us to be our best self. And when I say best self, I don't mean that in any kind of pop psychology way. I could imagine AI very easily knowing how well I slept the night before and what types of good or bad decisions I tend to make at 02:00 in the afternoon when I've only had 5 hours of sleep, or maybe just less REM sleep the night before. It might encourage me to take a little more time to think about something. Might give me a little tap on the wrist through a device that no one else would detect to refrain from something. Marc Andreessen: Never going to judge you. It's never going to be resentful. It's never going to be upset that you didn't listen to it. It's never going to go on vacation. It's going to be there for you. I think this is the way people are going to live. It's going to start with kids, and then over time it's going to be adults. I think the way people are going to live is they're going to have a friend, therapist, companion, mentor, coach, teacher, assistant. Or, by the way, maybe multiple of those. It may be that we're actually talking about six, like, different personas interacting, which is a whole 'nother possibility, but they're going to have-- Andrew Huberman: --A committee! Marc Andreessen: A committee, yeah, exactly. Actually different personas. And maybe, by the way, when there are difficult decisions to be made in your life, maybe what you want to hear is the argument among the different personas. And so you're just going to grow up, you're just going to have this in your life and you're going to always be able to talk to it and always be able to learn from it and always be able to help it make, it's going to be a symbiotic relationship. I think it's going to be a much better way to live. I think people are going to get a lot out of it. Andrew Huberman: What modalities will it include? So I can imagine my phone has this engine in it, this AI companion, and I'm listening in headphones as I walk into work. And it's giving me some, not just encouragement, some warnings, some thoughts that things that I might ask Marc Andreessen today that I might not have thought of and so on. I could also imagine it having a more human form. I could imagine it being tactile, having some haptic, so tapping to remind me so that it's not going to enter our conversation in a way that interferes or distracts you. But I would be aware. Oh, right. Things of that sort. I mean, how many different modalities are we going to allow these AI coaches to approach us with? And is anyone actually thinking about the hardware piece right now? Because I'm hearing a lot about the software piece. What does the hardware piece look like? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so this is where Silicon Valley is going to kick in. So the entrepreneurial community is going to try all of those, right? By the way, the big companies and startups are going to try all those. And so obviously there's big companies that are working, the big companies that have talked about a variety of these, including heads up displays, AR, VR kinds of things. There's lots of people doing voice. Thing is, voice is a real possibility. It may just be an earpiece. There's a new startup that just unveiled a new thing where they actually project. So you'll have like a pendant you wear on like a necklace, and it actually projects, literally, it'll project images on your hand or on the table or on the wall in front of you. So maybe that's how it shows up. Yeah. There are people working on so-called haptic or touch based kinds of things. There are people working on actually picking up nerve signals, like out of your arm. There's some science for being able to do basically like subvocalization. So maybe you could pick up that way by bone conduction. These are all going to be tried. So that's one question is the physical form of it, and then the other question is the software version of it, which is like, okay, what's the level of abstraction that you want to deal with these things in right now? It's like a question answer paradigm, so called chatbot, like, ask a question, get an answer, ask a question, get an answer. Well, you want that to go for sure to more of a fluid conversation. You want it to build up more knowledge of who you are, and you don't want to have to explain yourself a second time and so forth. And then you want to be able to tell it things like, well, remind me this, that, or be sure and tell me when X. But then maybe over time, more and more, you want it actually deciding when it's going to talk to you, right? And when it thinks it has something to say, it says it, and otherwise it stays silent. Andrew Huberman: Normally, at least in my head, unless I make a concerted effort to do otherwise, I don't think in complete sentences. So presumably these machines could learn my style of fragmented internal dialogue. And maybe I have an earpiece, and I'm walking in and I start hearing something, but it's some advice, etc, encouragement, discouragement. But at some point, those sounds that I hear in an earphone are very different than seeing something or hearing something in the room. We know this based on the neuroscience of musical perception and language perception. Hearing something in your head is very different. And I could imagine at some point that the AI will cross a precipice where if it has inline wiring to actually control neural activity in specific brain areas, and I don't mean very precisely, even just stimulating a little more prefrontal cortical activity, for instance, through the earpiece, a little ultrasound wave now can stimulate prefrontal cortex in a non invasive way that's being used clinically and experimentally, that the AI could decide that I need to be a little bit more context aware. This is something that is very beneficial for those listening that are trying to figure out how to navigate through life. It's like, you know, the context you're in and know the catalog of behaviors and words that are appropriate for that situation and not, you know, this would go along with agreeableness, perhaps, but strategic agreeableness, right. Context is important. There's nothing diabolical about that. Context is important, but I could imagine the AI recognizing we're entering a particular environment. I'm now actually going to ramp up activity in prefrontal cortex a little bit in a certain way that allows you to be more situationally aware of yourself and others, which is great, unless I can't necessarily short circuit that influence, because at some point, the AI is actually then controlling my brain activity and my decision making and my speech. I think that's what people fear is that once we cross that precipice that we are giving up control to the artificial versions of our human intelligence. Marc Andreessen: And look, I think we have to decide, we collectively, and we as individuals, I think, have to decide exactly how to do that. And this is the big thing that I believe about AI. That's just a much more, I would say, practical view of the world than a lot of the panic that you hear. It's just like, these are machines. They're able to do things that increasingly are like the things that people can do in some circumstances. But these are machines. We built a machine, means we decide how to use the machines. When we want the machines turned on, they're turned on, we want them turned off, they're turned off. I think that's absolutely the kind of thing that the individual person should always be in charge of. Andrew Huberman: Everyone was. And I have to imagine some people are still afraid of CRISPR, of gene editing. But gene editing stands to revolutionize our treatment of all sorts of disease, you know, inserting and deleting particular genes in adulthood. Not having to recombine in the womb. A new organism is an immensely powerful tool. And yet the Chinese scientist who did CRISPR on humans, this has been done, actually did his postdoc at Stanford with Steve Quake, then went to China, did CRISPR on babies. Mutated something. I believe it was one of the HIV receptors. I'm told it was with the intention of augmenting human memory. It had very little to do, in fact, with limiting susceptibility to HIV per se, to do with the way that receptor is involved in human memory. The world demonized that person. We actually don't know what happened to them. Whether or not they have a laboratory now or they're sitting in jail, it's unclear. But in China and elsewhere, people are doing CRISPR on humans. We know this. It's not legal in the US and other countries, but it's happening. Do you think it's a mistake for us to fear these technologies so much that we back away from them and end up 10, 20 years behind other countries that could use it for both benevolent or malevolent reasons? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, the details matter. So it's technology by technology. But I would say there's two things you always have to think about in these questions, I think, in terms of counterfactuals and opportunity cost. CRISPR is an interesting one. CRISPR manipulates the human genome. Nature manipulates the human, like, in all kinds of ways. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. [LAUGHS] Marc Andreessen: When you pick a spouse and you-- Andrew Huberman: --Have a child with that spouse-- Marc Andreessen: --Oh, boy-- Andrew Huberman: --You're doing genetic recombination. Marc Andreessen: Yes, you are. Quite possibly, if you're Genghis Khan, you're determining the future of humanity by those mutations. This is the old question of, basically, this is all state of nature, state of grace, basically. Is nature good? And then therefore, artificial things are bad, which is kind of shot. A lot of people have ethical views like that. I'm always of the view that nature is a bitch and wants us dead. Nature is out to get us, man. Nature wants to kill us, right? Like, nature wants to evolve all kinds of horrible viruses. Nature wants plagues. Nature wants to do weather. Nature wants to do all kinds of stuff. I mean, look, nature religion was the original religion, right? Like, that was the original thing people worshiped. And the reason was because nature was the thing that was out to get you right before you had scientific and technological methods to be able to deal with it. So, the idea of not doing these things, to me is just saying, oh, we're just going to turn over the future of everything to nature. And I think that there's no reason to believe that that leads in a particularly good direction or that that's not a value neutral decision. And then the related thing that comes from that is always this question around what's called the precautionary principle, which shows up in all these conversations on things like CRISPR, which basically is this principle that basically says, the inventors of a new technology should be required to prove that it will not have negative effects before they roll it out. This, of course, is a very new idea. This is actually a new idea in the 1970s. It's actually invented by the German Greens. The 1970s. Before that, people didn't think in those terms. People just invented things and rolled them out. And we got all of modern civilization by people inventing things and rolling them out. The German Greens came up with the precautionary principle for one specific purpose. I'll bet you can guess what it is. It was to prevent...? Andrew Huberman: Famine? Marc Andreessen: Nuclear power. It was to shut down attempts to do civilian nuclear power. And if you fast forward 50 years later, you're like, wow, that was a big mistake. So what they said at the time was, you have to prove that nuclear reactors are not going to melt down and cause all kinds of problems. And, of course, as an engineer, can you prove that will never happen? You can't. You can't rule out things that might happen in the future. And so that philosophy was used to stop nuclear power by the way, not just in Europe, but also in the US and around much of the rest of the world. If you're somebody who's concerned about carbon emissions, of course, this is the worst thing that happened in the last 50 years in terms of energy. We actually have the silver bullet answer to unlimited energy with zero carbon emissions, nuclear power. We choose not to do it. Not only do we choose not to do it, we're actually shutting down the plants that we have now in California. We just shut down the big plant. Germany just shut down their plants. Germany is in the middle of an energy war with Russia that, we are informed, is existential for the future of Europe. Andrew Huberman: But unless the risk of nuclear power plant meltdown has increased, and I have to imagine it's gone the other way, what is the rationale behind shutting down these plants and not expanding? Marc Andreessen: Because nuclear is bad. Right. Nuclear is icky. Nuclear has been tagged. Andrew Huberman: It just sounds bad. Nuclear. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Go nuclear. Marc Andreessen: Well, so what happened? Andrew Huberman: We didn't shut down postal offices and you hear go postal. Marc Andreessen: So what happened was, so nuclear technology arrived on planet Earth as a weapon, right? So it arrived in the form of. The first thing they did was in the middle of World War II. The first thing they did was the atomic bomb they dropped on Japan. And then there were all the debates that followed around nuclear weapons and disarmament. And there's a whole conversation to be had, by the way, about that, because there's different views you could have on that. And then it was in the. Where they started to roll out civilian nuclear power. And then there were accidents. There was like, three Mile island melted down, and then Chernobyl melted down in the Soviet Union, and then even recently, Fukushima melted down. And so there have been meltdowns. And so I think it was a combination of it's a weapon. It is sort of icky scientists sometimes with the ick factor, right. It glows green. And by the way, it becomes like a mythical fictional thing. And so you have all these movies of horrible supervillains powered by nuclear energy and all this stuff. Andrew Huberman: Well, the intro to the Simpsons, right. Is the nuclear power plant and the three eyed fish and all the negative implications of this nuclear power plant run by, at least in the Simpsons idiots. And that is the dystopia, where people are unaware of just how bad it. Marc Andreessen: Is and who owns the nuclear power plant. Right. This evil capitalist. Right. So it's connected to capitalism. Right. Andrew Huberman: We're blaming Matt Gronig for the demise of a particular-- Marc Andreessen: --He certainly didn't help. But it's literally, this amazing thing where if you're just like, thinking. If you're just thinking rationally, scientifically, you're like, okay, we want to get rid of carbon. This is the obvious way to do it. Okay, fun fact. Richard Nixon did two things that really mattered on this. So one is he defined in 1971 something called Project Independence, which was to create 1000 new state of the art nuclear plants, civilian nuclear plants, in the US by 1980. And to get the US completely off of oil and cut the entire US energy grid over to nuclear power, electricity, cut over to electric cars, the whole thing, like, detach from carbon. You'll notice that didn't happen. Why did that not happen? Because he also created the EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which then prevented that from happening. Right. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not authorize a new nuclear plant in the US for 40 years. Andrew Huberman: Why would he hamstring himself like that? Marc Andreessen: He got distracted by Watergate in Vietnam. Andrew Huberman: I think Ellsberg just died recently, right? The guy who released the Pentagon papers. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: So complicated. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly. It's this thing. He left office shortly thereafter. He didn't have time to fully figure this out. I don't know whether he would have figured it out or know. Look, Ford could have figured it out. Carter could have figured it out. Reagan could have figured it out. Any of these guys could have figured it out. It's like the most obvious. Knowing what we know today, it's the most obvious thing in the world. The Russia thing is the amazing thing. It's like Europe is literally funding Russia's invasion of Ukraine by paying them for oil, right? And they can't shut off the oil because they won't cut over to nuclear, right? And then, of course, what happens? Okay, so then here's the other kicker of what happens, right? Which is they won't do nuclear, but they want to do renewables, right? Sustainable energy. And so what they do is they do solar and wind. Solar and wind are not reliable because it sometimes gets dark out and sometimes the wind doesn't blow. And so then what happens is they fire up the coal plants, right? And so the actual consequence of the precautionary principle for the purpose it was invented is a massive spike in use of coal. Andrew Huberman: That's taking us back over 100 years. Marc Andreessen: Yes. Correct. That is the consequence of the cautionary principle. That's the consequence of that mentality. And so it's a failure of a principle on its own merits for the thing it was designed. Then, you know, there's a whole movement of people who want to apply it to every new thing. And this is the hot topic on AI right now in Washington, which is like, oh my God, these people have to prove that this can never get used for bad things. Andrew Huberman: Sorry, I'm hung up on this nuclear thing. And I wonder, can it just be? I mean, there is something about the naming of things. We know this in, I mean, you know, Lamarckian evolution and things like that. These are bad words in biology. But we had a guest on this podcast, Oded Rechavii, who's over in Israel, who's shown inherited traits. But if you talk about his Lamarckian, then it has all sorts of negative implications. But his discoveries have important implications for everything from inherited trauma to treatment of disease. I mean, there's all sorts of positives that await us if we are able to reframe our thinking around something that, yes, indeed, could be used for evil, but that has enormous potential and that is in agreement with nature, right? This fundamental truth that at least to my knowledge, no one is revising in any significant way anytime soon. So what if it were called something else? It could be nuclear. It's called sustainable, right? I mean, it's amazing how marketing can shift our perspective of robots, for instance. Or anyway, I'm sure you can come up with better examples than I can, but is there a good, solid PR firm working from the nuclear side? Marc Andreessen: Thunbergian. Greta Thunberg. Andrew Huberman: Thunbergian. Marc Andreessen: Thunbergian. Like if she was in favor of it, which by the way, she's not. She's dead set against it. Andrew Huberman: She said that 100%. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Based on. Marc Andreessen: Based on Thunbergian principles. The prevailing ethic in environmentalism for 50 years is that nuclear is evil. Like, they won't consider it. There are, by the way, certain environmentalists who disagree with this. And so Stuart Brand is the one that's been the most public, and he has impeccable credentials in the space. Andrew Huberman: And he wrote Whole Earth Catalog . Marc Andreessen: Whole Earth Catalog guy. Yeah. And he's written a whole bunch of really interesting book since. And he wrote a recent book that goes through in detail. He's like, yes, obviously the correct environmental thing to do is nuclear power. And we should be implementing project independence. We should be building a thousand. Specifically, he didn't say this, but this is what I would say. We should hire Charles Koch. We should hire Koch Industries and they should build us a thousand nuclear power plants, and then we should give them the presidential Medal of Freedom for saving the environment. Andrew Huberman: And that would put us independent of our reliance on oil. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Then we're done with. We're just, think about what happens. We're done with oil, zero emissions, we're done with the Middle East. We're done. We're done. We're not drilling on American land anymore. We're not drilling on foreign land. Like, we have no military entanglements in places where we're not despoiling Alaska. We're not, nothing. No offshore rigs, no nothing. We're done. And basically just you build state of the art plants, engineered properly, you have them just completely contained. When there's nuclear waste, you just entomb the waste in concrete. So it just sits there forever. It's just a very small footprint kind of thing. And you're just done. And so to me, it's like scientifically, technologically, this is just like the most obvious thing in the world. It's a massive tell on the part of the people who claim to be pro-environment that they're not in favor of this. Andrew Huberman: And if I were to say, tweet that I'm pro nuclear power because it's the more sustainable form of power, if I hypothetically did that today, what would happen to me in this. Marc Andreessen: You'd be a cryptofascist.] LAUGHS] Dirty, evil, capitalist monster. How dare you? Andrew Huberman: I'm unlikely to run that experiment. I was just curious. That was what we call a Gedanken experiment. Marc Andreessen: Andrew, you're a terrible human being. We were looking for evidence that you're a terrible human being, and now we know it. This is a great example of the, I gave Andrew a book on the way in here with this, my favorite new book. The title of it is When Reason Goes on Holiday , and this is a great example of it is, the people who simultaneously say they're environmentalists and say they're anti nuclear power. Like the positions just simply don't reconcile. But that doesn't bother them at all. So be clear. I predict none of this will happen. Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I need to learn more about nuclear power. Marc Andreessen: Long coal. Andrew Huberman: Long coal. Marc Andreessen: Long coal. Invest in coal. Andrew Huberman: Because you think we're just going to revert? Marc Andreessen: It's the energy source of the future. Well, because it can't be solar and wind, because they're not reliable. So you need something. If it's not nuclear, it's going to be either like oil, natural gas, or coal. Andrew Huberman: And you're unwilling to say bet on nuclear because you don't think that the sociopolitical elitist trends that are driving against nuclear are likely to dissipate anytime soon. Marc Andreessen: Not a chance. I can't imagine it would be great if they did. But the powers that be are very locked in on this as a position. And look, they've been saying this for 50 years, and so they'd have to reverse themselves off of a bad position they've had for 50 years. And people really don't like to do that. Andrew Huberman: One thing that's good about this and other podcasts is that young people listen and they eventually will take over. Marc Andreessen: And by the way, I will say also there are nuclear entrepreneurs. So on the point of young kids, there are a bunch of young entrepreneurs who are basically not taking no for an answer. And they're trying to develop, in particular, there's people trying to develop new, very small form factor nuclear power plants with a variety of possible use cases. So, look, maybe they show up with a better mousetrap and people take a second look, but we'll see. Andrew Huberman: Just rename it. So, my understanding is that you think we should go all in on AI with the constraints that we discover we need in order to rein in safety and things of that sort. Not unlike social media, not unlike the Internet. Marc Andreessen: Not unlike what we should have done with nuclear power. Andrew Huberman: And in terms of the near infinite number of ways that AI can be envisioned to harm us, how do you think we should cope with that psychologically? Because I can imagine a lot of people listening to this conversation are thinking, okay, that all sounds great, but there are just too many what ifs that are terrible, right? What if the machines take over? What if the silly example I gave earlier, but what if one day I could log into my hard earned bank account and it's all gone? The AI version of myself ran off with someone else, and with all my money, my AI coach abandoned me for somebody else. After it learned all the stuff that I taught it. It took off with somebody else stranded. And it has my bank account numbers, like this kind of thing. Marc Andreessen: You could really make this scenario horrible, right, if you kept going? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well, we can throw in a benevolent example as well to counter it, but it's kind of fun to think about where the human mind goes, right? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So first I say we've got to separate the real problems from the fake problems. And so there's a lot. A lot of the science fiction scenarios I think are just not real. And the ones that you decided as an example, like, it's. That's not what is going to happen. And I can explain why that's not what's going to happen. There's a set of fake ones, and the fake ones are the ones that just aren't, I think, technologically grounded, that aren't rational. It's the AI is going to wake up and decide to kill us all. It's going to develop the kind of agency where it's going to steal our money and our spouse and everything else, our kids. That's not how it works. And then there's also all these concerns, destruction of society concerns. And this is misinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, like all that stuff, which I don't think is actually a real problem. And then people have a bunch of economic concerns around what's going to take all the jobs and all those kinds of things. We could talk about that. I don't think that's actually the thing that happens. But then there are two actual real concerns that I actually do very much agree with. And one of them is what you said, which is bad people doing bad things. And there's a whole set of things to be done inside there. The big one is we should use AI to build defenses against all the bad things, right? And so, for example, there's a concern AI is going to make it easier for bad people to build pathogens, design pathogens in labs, which bad scientists can do today, but this is going to make it easier, easier to do. Well, obviously, we should have the equivalent of an Operation Warpspeed, operating in perpetuity anyway. But then we should use AI to build much better bio defenses. And we should be using AI today to design, like, for example, full spectrum vaccines against every possible form of pathogen. So defensive mechanism hacking, you can use AI to build better defense tools, right? And so you should have a whole new kind of security suite wrapped around you, wrapped around your data, wrapped around your money, where you're having AI repel attacks, disinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, all that stuff. You should have an AI filter when you use the Internet, where you shouldn't have to figure out whether it's really me or whether it's a made up thing. You should have an AI assistant that's doing that for you. Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I mean, these little banners and cloaks that you see on social media like "this has been deemed misinformation." If you're me, you always click because you're like, what's behind the scrim? I don't always look at this image is gruesome type thing. Sometimes I just pass on that. But if it's something that seems debatable, of course you look well. Marc Andreessen: And you should have an AI assistant with you when you're on the Internet. And you should be able to tell that AI assistant what you want, right? So, yes, I want the full experience. Show me everything. I want it from a particular point of view. And I don't want to hear from these other people who I don't like, by the way. It's going to be, my eight year old is using this. I don't want anything that's going to cause a problem. And I want everything filtered and AI based filters like that that you program and control are going to work much better and be much more honest and straightforward and clear and so forth than what we have today. Anyway, basically, what I want people to do is think, every time you think of a risk of how it can be used, just think of like, okay, we can use it to build a countermeasure. And the great thing about the countermeasures is they can not only offset AI risks, they can offset other risks. Right? Because we already live in a world where pathogens are a problem, right? We ought to have better vaccines anyway. We already live in a world where there's cyber hacking and cyber terrorism. They already live in a world where there's bad content on the Internet. And we have the ability now to build much better AI powered tools to deal with all those things. Andrew Huberman: I also love the idea of the AI physicians. Getting decent health care in this country is so difficult, even for people who have means or insurance. I mean, the number of phone calls and waits that you have to go through to get a referral to see a specialist, it's absurd. The process is absurd. I mean, it makes one partially or frankly ill just to go through the process of having to do all that. I don't know how anyone does it. And granted, I don't have the highest degree of patience, but I'm pretty patient, and it drives me insane to even just get remedial care. So I can think of a lot of benevolent uses of AI. And I'm grateful that you're bringing this up and here and that you've tweeted about it in that thread. Again, we'll refer people to that. And that you're thinking about this. I have to imagine that in your role as investor nowadays, that you're also thinking about AI quite often in terms of all these roles. And so does that mean that there are a lot of young people who are really bullish on AI and are going for it? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Okay. Andrew Huberman: This is here to stay. Marc Andreessen: Okay. Andrew Huberman: Unlike CRISPR, which is sort of in this liminal place where biotech companies aren't sure if they should invest or not in CRISPR because it's unclear whether or not the governing bodies are going to allow gene editing, just like it was unclear 15 years ago if they were going to allow gene therapy. But now we know they do allow gene therapy and immunotherapy. Marc Andreessen: Okay, so there is a fight. Having said that, there is a fight. There's a fight happening in Washington right now over exactly what should be legal or not legal. And there's quite a bit of risk, I think, attached to that fight right now because there are some people in there that are telling a very effective story to try to get people to either outlaw AI or specifically limit it to a small number of big companies, which I think is potentially disastrous. By the way, the EU also is, like, super negative. The EU has turned super negative on basically all new technology, so they're moving to try to outlaw AI, which if they outlaw AI, flat out don't want it. Andrew Huberman: But that's like saying you're going to outlaw the Internet. I don't see how you can stop this train. Marc Andreessen: And frankly, they're not a big fan of the Internet either. So I think they regret the EU has a very, especially the EU bureaucrats, the people who run the EU in Brussels have a very negative view on a lot of modernity. Andrew Huberman: But what I'm hearing calls to mind things that I've heard people like David Goggins say, which is, you know, there's so many lazy, undisciplined people out there that nowadays it's easier and easier to become exceptional. I've heard him say something to that extent. It almost sounds like there's so many countries that are just backing off of particular technologies because it just sounds bad from the PR perspective that it's creating great, kind of, low hanging fruit, opportunities for people to barge forward and countries to barge forward. If they're willing to embrace this stuff. Marc Andreessen: It is, but number one, you have to have a country that wants to do that. Those exist, and there are countries like that. And then the other is, look, they need to be able to withstand the attack from stronger countries that don't want them to do it, right? So the EU, the EU has nominal control over whatever it is, 27 or whatever member countries. So even if you're like, whatever the Germans get all fired up about, whatever, Brussels can still, in a lot of cases, just like flat out, basically control them and tell them not to do it. And then the US, you know, we have a lot of control over a lot of the world. Andrew Huberman: But it sounds like we sit somewhere sort of in between. Like right now, people are developing AI technologies in US companies, r ight? So it is happening. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, today it's happening. But like I said, there's a set of people who are very focused in Washington right now about trying to either ban it outright or trying to, as I said, limit it to a small number of big companies. And then, look, China's got a whole, the other part of this is China's got a whole different kind of take on this than we do. And so they're, of course, going to allow it for sure, but they're going to allow it in the ways that their system wants it to happen. Right. Which is much more for population control and to implement authoritarianism. And then, of course, they are going to spread their technology and their vision of how society should run across the world. So we're back in a Cold War dynamic like we were with the Soviet Union, where there are two different systems that have fundamentally different views on issues, concepts like freedom and individual choice and freedom of speech. And so, you know, we know where the Chinese stand. We're still figuring out where we stand. I'm having specifically a lot of schizophrenic conversations with people in DC right now, where if I talk to them and China doesn't come up, they just hate tech. They hate American tech companies, they hate AI, they hate social media, they hate this, they hate that, they hate crypto, they hate everything, and they just want to punish and ban, and they're just very negative. But then if we have a conversation a half hour later and we talk about China, then the conversation is totally different. Now we need a partnership between the US government and American tech companies to defeat China. It's like the exact opposite discussion. Right? Andrew Huberman: Is that fear or competitiveness on China specifically in terms of the US response in, you know, you bring up these technologies, know, I'll lump CRISPR in there things like CRISPR, nuclear power, AI. It all sounds very cold, very dystopian to a lot of people. And yet there are all these benevolent uses as we've been talking about. And then you say you raise the issue of China and then it sounds like this big dark cloud emerging. And then all of a sudden, we need to galvanize and develop these technologies to counter their effort. So is it fear of them or is it competitiveness or both? Marc Andreessen: Well, so without them in the picture, you just have this. Basically there's an old Bedouin saying as me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my brother and my cousin against the world. It's actually, it's evolution in action, I think we'd think about it, is if there's no external threat, then the conflict turns inward, and then at that point, there's a big fight between specifically, tech, and then I was just say, generally politics. And my interpretation of that fight is it's a fight for status. It's fundamentally a fight for status and for power, which is like, if you're in politics, you like the status quo of how power and status work in our society. You don't want these new technologies to show up and change things, because change is bad, right? Change threatens your position. It threatens the respect that people have for you and your control over things. And so I think it's primarily a status fight, which we could talk about. But the China thing is just like a straight up geopolitical us versus them. Like I said, it's like a Cold War scenario. And look, 20 years ago, the prevailing view in Washington was, we need to be friends with China, right? And we're going to be trading partners with China. And yes, they're a totalitarian dictatorship, but if we trade with them, over time, they'll become more democratic. In the last five to ten years, it's become more and more clear that that's just not true. And now there's a lot of people in both political parties in DC who very much regret that and want to change too much, more of a sort of a Cold War footing. Andrew Huberman: Are you willing to comment on TikTok and technologies that emerge from China that are in widespread use within the US, like how much you trust them or don't trust them? I can go on record myself by saying that early on, when TikTok was released, we were told, as Stanford faculty, that we should not and could not have TikTok accounts nor WeChat accounts. Marc Andreessen: So to start with, there are a lot of really bright Chinese tech entrepreneurs and engineers who are trying to do good things. I'm totally positive about that. So I think many of the people mean very well, but the Chinese have a specific system, and the system is very clear and unambiguous. And the system is, everything in China is owned by the party. It's not even owned by the state. It's owned by the party. It's owned by the Chinese Communist Party. So the Chinese Communist Party owns everything, and they control everything. By the way, it's actually illegal to this day. It's illegal for an investor to buy equity in a Chinese company. There's all these basically legal machinations that people do to try to do something that's like the economic equivalent to that, but it's actually still illegal to do that. The Chinese Communist Party has no intention of letting foreigners own any of China. Like, zero intention of that. And they regularly move to make sure that that doesn't happen. So they own everything. They control everything. Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt you, but people in China can invest in American companies all the time. Marc Andreessen: Well, they can, subject to US government constraints. There is a US government system that attempts to mediate that called CFIUS, and there are more and more limitations being put on that. But if you can get through that approval process, then legally you can do that, whereas the same is not true with respect to China. So they just have a system. And so if you're the CEO of a Chinese company, it's not optional. If you're the CEO of ByteDance, CEO of Tencent, your relationship with the Chinese Communist Party is not optional, it's required. And what's required is you are a unit of the party and you and your company do what the party says. And when the party says we get full access to all user data in America, you say yes. When the party says you change the algorithm to optimize to a certain social result, you say whatever. It's whatever Xi Jinping and his party cadres decide, and that's what gets implemented. If you're the CEO of a Chinese tech company, there is a political officer assigned to you who has an office down the hall. And at any given time, he can come down the hall, he can grab you out of your staff meeting or board meeting, and he can take you down the hall and he can make you sit for hours and study Marxism and Xi Jinping thought and quiz you on it and test you on it, and you'd better pass the test, Right? So it's like a straight political control thing. And then, by the way, if you get crossways with them, like... Andrew Huberman: So when we see tech founders getting called up to Congress for what looks like interrogation, but it's probably pretty light interrogation compared to what happens in other countries. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, it's state power. They just have this view of top down state power, and they view it's that their system, and they view that it's necessary for lots of historical and moral reasons that they've defined, and that's how they run. And then they've got a view that says how they want to propagate that vision outside the country. And they have these programs like Belt and Road that basically are intended to propagate kind of their vision worldwide. And so they are who they are. I will say that they don't lie about it. They're very straightforward. They give speeches, they write books. You can buy Xi Jinping speeches. He goes through the whole thing. They have their tech 2025 plan. This is like ten years ago. Their whole AI agenda, it's all in there. Andrew Huberman: And is their goal that in 200 years, 300 years, that China is the superpower controlling everything? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Or 20 years, 30 years, or two years, three years. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, but they've got a shorter horizon. Marc Andreessen: I don't know. Everybody's a little bit like this, I guess, but, yeah, they want to win. Andrew Huberman: Well, the CRISPR in humans example that I gave earlier was interesting to me because, first of all, I'm a neuroscientist and they could have edited any genes, but they chose to edit the genes involved in the attempt to create super memory babies, which presumably would grow into super memory adults. And whether or not they succeeded in that isn't clear. Those babies are alive and presumably by now, walking, talking. As far as I know, whether or not they have super memories isn't clear. But China is clearly unafraid to augment biology in that way. And I believe that that's inevitable, that's going to happen elsewhere, probably first for the treatment of disease. But at some point, I'm assuming people are going to augment biology to make smarter kids, not always, but often will select mates based on the traits they would like their children to inherit. So this happens far more frequently than could be deemed bad. Either that or people are bad, because people do this all the time, selecting mates that have physical and psychological and cognitive traits that you would like your offspring to have. CRISPR is a more targeted approach. Of course, the reason I'm kind of giving this example and examples like it is that I feel like so much of the way that governments and the public react to technologies is to just take that first glimpse. And it just feels scary. You think about the old Apple ad of the 1984 Ad. I mean, there was one very scary version of the personal computer and computers and robots taking over and everyone like automatons. And then there was the Apple version where it's all about creativity, love and peace, and it had the pseudo psychedelic California thing going for it. Again, great marketing seems to convert people's thinking about technology such that what was once viewed as very scary and dangerous and dystopian is like an oasis of opportunity. So why are people so afraid of new technologies? Marc Andreessen: So this is the thing I've tried to understand for a long time, because the history is so clear and the history basically is that every new technology is greeted by what's called a moral panic. And so it's basically this hysterical freak out of some kind that causes people to basically predict the end of the world. And you go back in time, and actually, this is a historical sort of effect, it happens even in things now where you just look back and it's ludicrous. And so you mentioned earlier the satanic panic of the concern around, like, heavy metal music. Before that, there was, like, a freak out around comic books. In the 50s, there was a freak out around jazz music in the 20s and 30s, it's devil music. There was a freak out, the arrival of bicycles caused a moral panic in the, like, 1860s, 1870s. Bicycles? Bicycles, yeah. So there was this thing at the time. So bicycles were the first. They were the first very easy to use personal transportation thing that basically let kids travel between towns quickly without any overhead. You have to take care of a horse. You just jump on a bike and go. And so there was a historical panic, specifically around at the time, young women who for the first time, were able to venture outside the confines of the town to maybe go have a boyfriend, another town. And so the magazines at the time read all these stories on this phenomenon, medical phenomenon, called bicycle face. And the idea of bicycle face was the exertion caused by pedaling a bicycle would cause your face. Your face would grimace, and then if you were on the bicycle for too long, your face would lock into place. Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Sorry. Marc Andreessen: And then you would be unattractive, and therefore, of course, unable to then get married. Cars, there was a moral panic around red flag laws. There are all these laws that created the automobile. Automobiles freaked people out. So there are all these laws in the early days of the automobile, in a lot of places, you would take a ride in an automobile and automobiles, they broke down all the time. So only rich people had automobiles. It'd be you and your mechanic in the car. Right, for when it broke down. And then you had to hire another guy to walk 200 yards in front of the car with a red flag, and he had to wave the red flag. And so you could only drive as fast as he could walk because the red flag was to warn people that the car was coming. I think it was Pennsylvania. They had the most draconian version, which was they were very worried about the car scaring the horses. And so there was a law that said if you saw a horse coming, you needed to stop the car. You had to disassemble the car, and you had to hide the pieces of the car behind the nearest hay bale, wait for the horse to go by, and then you could put your car back together. Anyways, an example is electric lighting. There was a panic around, like, whether this is going to become complete ruin. This is going to completely ruin the romance of the dark. And it was going to cause a whole new kind of terrible civilization where everything is always brightly lit. So there's just all these examples. And so it's like, okay, what on earth is happening? That this is always what happens? And so I finally found this book that I think has a good model for it. A book is called Men, Machines, and Modern Times . And it's written by this MIT professor, like, 60 years ago. So it predates the Internet, but it uses a lot of historical examples. And what he says, basically, is, he says there's actually a three stage response. There's a three stage societal response to new technologies. It's very predictable. He said, stage one is basically just denial. Just ignore. Like, we just don't pay attention to this. Nobody takes it seriously. There's just a blackout on the whole topic. He says, that's stage one. Stage two is rational counterargument. So stage two is where you line up all the different reasons why this can't possibly work. It can't possibly ever get cheap, or this, that it's not fast enough, or whatever the thing is. And then he says, stage three, he says, is when the name calling begins. So he says, stage three is like when they fail to ignore it and they've failed to argue society out of it. Andrew Huberman: I love it. Marc Andreessen: They move to the name calling. And what's the name calling? The name calling is, this is evil. This is moral panic. This is evil. This is terrible. This is awful. This is going to destroy everything. Don't you understand? All this is horrifying. And you, the person working on it, are being reckless and evil and all this stuff, and you must be stopped. And he said the reason for that is because, basically, fundamentally, what these things are is they're a war over status. It's a war over status, and therefore a war over power. And then, of course, ultimately money. But human status is the thing, because what he says is, what is the societal impact of a new technology? The societal impact of a new technology is it reorders status in the society. So the people who are specialists in that technology become high status, and the people who are specialists in the previous way of doing things become low status. And generally, people don't adapt. Generally, if you're the kind of person who is high status because you're an evolved adaptation to an existing technology, you're probably not the kind of person that's going to enthusiastically try to replant yourself onto a new technology. This is like every politician who's just like in a complete state of panic about social media. Like, why are they so freaked out about social media? Is, because they all know that the whole nature of modern politics has changed. The entire battery of techniques that you use to get elected before social media are now obsolete. Obviously, the best new politicians of the future are going to be 100% creations of social media. Andrew Huberman: And podcasts. Marc Andreessen: And podcasts. Andrew Huberman: And we're seeing this now as we head towards the next presidential election. That podcasts clearly are going to be featured very heavily in that next election, because long form content is a whole different landscape. Marc Andreessen: Rogan's had, like, what? He's had, like Bernie, he's had like Tulsi, he's had like a whole series. Andrew Huberman: Of RFK most recently. And that's created a lot of controversy. Marc Andreessen: A lot of controversy. But also my understanding, I'm sure he's invited everybody. I'm sure he'd love to have Biden on. I'm sure he'd love to have Trump on. Andrew Huberman: I'm sure he'd have to ask him. I mean, I think every podcaster has their own ethos around who they invite on and why and how. So I certainly can't speak for him, but I have to imagine that any opportunity to have true, long form discourse that would allow people to really understand people's positions on things, I have to imagine that he would be in favor of that sort of thing. Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Or somebody else would, right? Some other top podcaster would. Exactly. I totally agree with you. But my point is, if you're a politician, if you're a legacy politician, you have the option of embracing the new technology. You can do it anytime you want. Right. But you don't. They're not, they won't. They won't do it. And why won't they do it? Well, okay, first of all, they want to ignore it. They want to pretend that things aren't changing. Second is they want to have rational counterarguments for why the existing campaign system works the way that it does, and this and that and the existing media networks. And here's how you do things, and here's how you give speeches, and here's the clothes you wear and the tie and the thing and the pocket square, and you've, that. It's how you succeeded was coming up through that system. So you've got all your arguments as to why that won't work anymore. And then we've now proceeded to the name calling phase, which is now it's evil, right? Now it's evil for somebody to show up on a stream, God forbid, for three hours and actually say what they think. It's going to destroy society, right? So it's exactly like, it's a classic example of this pattern. Anyway, so Morrison says in the book, basically, this is the forever pattern. This will never change. This is one of those things where you can learn about it and still nothing, the entire world could learn about this, and still nothing changes. Because at the end of the day, it's not the tech that's the question, it's the reordering of status. Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of thoughts about the podcast component. I'll just say this because I want to get back to the topic of innovation of technology. But on a long form podcast, there's no safe zone. The person can get up and walk out. But if the person interviewing them, and certainly Joe is the best of the very best, if not the most skilled podcaster in the entire universe at continuing to press people on specific topics when they're trying to bob and weave and wriggle out, he'll just keep either drilling or alter the question somewhat in a way that forces them to finally come up with an answer of some sort. And I think that probably puts certain people's cortisol levels through the roof, such that they just would never go on there. Marc Andreessen: I think there's another deeper question also, or another question along with that, which is how many people actually have something to say. Andrew Huberman: Real substance. Marc Andreessen: Right. Like how many people can actually talk in a way that's actually interesting to anybody else for any length of time. How much substance is there, really? And a lot of historical politics was to be able to manufacture a facade where you honestly, as far as you can't tell how deep the thoughts are, even if they have deep thoughts, it's kept away from you. They would certainly never cop to it. Andrew Huberman: It's going to be an interesting next, what is it, about 20 months or so. Marc Andreessen: So panic and the name calling have already started? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I was going to say this list of three things, denial, the counterargument, and name calling. It seems like with AI, it's already just jumped to numbers two and three. Marc Andreessen: Yes, correct. Andrew Huberman: We're already at two and three, and it's kind of leaning three. Marc Andreessen: That's correct. AI is unusual just because new technologies that take off, they almost always have a prehistory. They almost always have a 30 or 40 year history where people tried and failed to get them to work before they took off. AI has an 80 year prehistory, so it has a very long one. And then it all of a sudden started to work dramatically well, seemingly overnight. And so it went from basically as far as most people were concerned, it went from it doesn't work at all to it works incredibly well in one step, and that almost never happens. I actually think that's exactly what's happening. I think it's actually speed running this progression just because if you use Midjourney or you use GPT or any of these things for five minutes, you're just like, wow, obviously this thing is going to be like, obviously in my life, this is going to be the best thing ever. This is amazing. There's all these ways that I can use it. And then therefore, immediately you're like, oh my God, this is going to transform everything. Therefore, step three, straight to the name calling. Andrew Huberman: In the face of all this. There are innovators out there. Maybe they are aware they are innovators. Maybe they are already starting companies, or maybe they are just some young or older person who has these five traits in abundance or doesn't, but knows somebody who does and is partnering with them in some sort of idea. And you have an amazing track record at identifying these people. I think in part because you have those same traits yourself. I've heard you say the following: the world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. That's a remarkable quote because it says at least two things to me. One is that you have a very clear understanding of the inner workings of these great innovators. We talked a little bit about that earlier, these five traits, etc., but that also you have an intense understanding of the world landscape. And the way that we've been talking a bout it for the last hour or so is that it is a really intense and kind of oppressive landscape. You've got countries and organizations and elites and journalists that are trying to, not necessarily trying, but are suppressing the innovation process. I mean, that's sort of the picture that I'm getting. So it's like we're trying to innovate inside of a vise that's getting progressively tighter. And yet this quote argues that it is the person, the boy or girl, man or woman, who says, well, you know what? That all might be true, but my view of the world is the way the world's going to bend, or I'm going to create a dent in that vise that allows me to exist the way that I want. Or you know what, I'm actually going to uncurl the vise in the other direction. And so I'm at once picking up a sort of pessimistic, glass half empty view of the world, as well as a glass half full view. So tell me about that. Could you tell us about that from the perspective of someone listening who is thinking, I've got an idea, and I know it's a really good one, because I just know I might not have the confidence of extrinsic reward yet, but I just know there's a seed of something. What does it take to foster that? And how do we foster real innovation in the landscape that we're talking about? Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so part is, I think, one of the ways to square it is, I think you as the innovator need to be signed up to fight the fight, right? And again, this is where the fictional portrayals of startups, I think, take people off course, or even scientists or whatever, because when there's great success stories, they get kind of prettified after the fact and they get made to be cute and fun, and it's like, yeah, no, if you talk to anybody who actually did any of these, like, these things are always just like brutal exercises and just like sheer willpower and fighting forces that are trying to get you. So part of it is you have to be signed up for the fight. And this kind of goes to the conscientiousness thing we're talking also. My partner, Ben, uses the term courage a lot, which is some combination of just stubbornness, but coupled with a willingness to take pain and not stop and have people think very bad things of you for a long time until it turns out you hopefully prove yourself correct. And so you have to be willing to do that. It's a contact sport. These aren't easy roads, right? It's a contact sport, so you have to be signed up for the fight. The advantage that you have as an innovator is that at the end of the day, the truth actually matters. And all the arguments in the world, the classic Victor Hugo quote is, "There's nothing more powerful in the world than an idea whose time has come." If it's real, right? And this is just pure substance, if the thing is real, if the idea is real, if it's a legitimately good scientific discovery about how the nature works, if it's a new invention, if it's a new work of art, and if it's real, then you do, at the end of the day, you have that on your side. And all of the people who are fighting you and arguing with you and telling you no, they don't have that on their side. It's not that they're showing up with some other thing and they're like, my thing is better than your thing. That's not the main problem. The main problem is I have a thing. I'm convinced everybody else is telling me it's stupid, wrong, it should be illegal, whatever the thing is. But at the end of the day, I still have the thing, right? So at the end of the day, the truth really matters. The substance really matters if it's real. I'll give you an example. It's really hard historically to find an example of a new technology that came into the world that was then pulled back. Nuclear is maybe an example of that. But even still, there are still nuclear plants, like, running today. That still exists. I would say the same thing as scientific, at least I may ask you this. I don't know of any scientific discovery that was made, and then people like, I know there are areas of science that are not politically correct to talk about today, but every scientist knows the truth. The truth is still the truth. I mean, even the geneticists in the Soviet Union who were forced to buy in, like, knew the whole time that it was wrong. That I'm completely convinced of. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, they couldn't delude themselves, especially because the basic training that one gets in any field establishes some core truths upon which even the crazy ideas have to rest. And if they don't, as you pointed out, things fall to pieces. I would say that even the technologies that did not pan out and in some cases were disastrous, but that were great ideas at the beginning, are starting to pan out. So the example I'll give is that most people are aware of the Elizabeth Holmes Theranos debacle, to put it lightly, analyzing what's in a single drop of blood as a way to analyze hormones and disease and antibodies, etc. I mean, that's a great idea, it's a terrific idea. As opposed to having a phlebotomist come to your house or you have to go in and you get tapped and then pulling vials and the whole thing. There's now a company born out of Stanford that is doing exactly what she sought to do, except that at least the courts ruled that she fudged the thing, and that's why she's in jail right now. But the idea of getting a wide array of markers from a single drop of blood is an absolutely spectacular idea. The biggest challenge that company has is going to confront is the idea that it's just the next Theranos. But if they've got the thing and t hey're not fudging it, as apparently Theranos was, I think everything will work out ala Victor Hugo. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly. Because who wants to go back if they get to the work, if it's real? This is the thing. The opponents, they're not bringing their own ideas. They're not bringing their, oh, my idea is better than yours. That's not what's happening. They're bringing the silence or counterargument or name calling. Andrew Huberman: Well, this is why I think people who need to be loved probably stand a reduced chance of success. And maybe that's also why having people close to you that do love you and allowing that to be sufficient can be very beneficial. This gets back to the idea of partnership and family around innovators, because if you feel filled up by those people local to you in your home, then you don't need people on the Internet saying nice things about you or your ideas, because you're good and you can forge forward. Another question about innovation is the teams that you assemble around you, and you've talked before about the sort of small squadron model, sort of David and Goliath examples as well, where a small group of individuals can create a technology that frankly outdoes what a giant like Facebook might be doing or what any other large company might be doing. There are a lot of theories as to why that would happen, but I know you have some unique theories. Why do you think small groups can defeat large organizations? Marc Andreessen: So the conventional explanation is, I think, correct, and it's just that large organizations have a lot of advantages, but they just have a very hard time actually executing anything because of all the overhead. So large organizations have combinatorial communication overhead. The number of people who have to be consulted, who have to agree on things, gets to be staggering. The amount of time it takes to schedule the meeting gets to be staggering. You get these really big companies and they have some issue they're dealing with, and it takes like a month to schedule the pre meeting, to plan for the meeting, which is going to happen two months later, which is then going to result in a post meeting, which will then result in a board presentation, which will then result in a planning off site. Andrew Huberman: I thought academia was bad. But what you're describing is giving me hives. Marc Andreessen: Kafka was a documentary. Yeah. Look, you'd have these organizations at 100,000 people are more like you're more of a nation state than a company. And you've got all these competing internal, it's the Bedouin thing I was saying before. You've got all these internal, at most big companies, your internal enemies are way more dangerous to you than anybody on the outside. Andrew Huberman: Can you elaborate on that? Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah. At a big company, the big competition is for the next promotion, right? And the enemy for the next promotion is the next executive over in your company. That's your enemy. The competitor on the outside is like an abstraction. Like, maybe they'll matter someday, whatever. I've got to beat that guy inside my own company. Right? And so the internal warfare is at least as intense as the external warfare. This is just all the iron law of all these big bureaucracies and how they function. So if a big bureaucracy ever does anything productive, I think it's like a miracle. It's like a miracle to the point where there should be like a celebration, there should be parties, there should be like ticker tape parades for big, large organizations that actually do things. That's great because it's so rare. It doesn't happen very often anyway. So that's the conventional explanation, whereas, look, small companies, small teams, there's a lot that they can't do because they're not operating at scale and they don't have global coverage and all these kind of, they don't have the resources and so forth. But at least they can move quickly, right? They can organize fast. If there's an issue today, they can have a meeting today, they can solve the issue today. And everybody they need to solve the issue is in the room today. So they can just move a lot faster. I think that's part of it. But I think there's another deeper thing underneath that, that people really don't like to talk about. That takes us back full circle to where we started, which is just the sheer number of people in the world who are capable of doing new things is just a very small set of people. And so you're not going to have 100 of them in a company or 1000 or 10,000. You're going to have three, eight or ten, maybe. Andrew Huberman: And some of them are flying too close to the sun. Marc Andreessen: Some of them are blowing themselves up, right? Some of them are. So IBM. I actually first learned this at IBM. My first actual job job was at IBM when IBM was still on top of the world right before it caved in the early 90s. And so when I was there it was 440,000 employees which, and again if you inflation adjust like today for that same size of business, inflation adjusted, market size adjusted, it would be its equivalent today of like a two or three million person organization. It was a nation state. There were 6000 people in my division and we were next door to another building that had another 6000 people in another division. So you could work there for years and never meet anybody who didn't work for IBM. The first half of every meeting was just IBMers introducing themselves to each other. It was just mind boggling, the level of complexity. But they were so powerful that they had four years before I got there in 1985, they were 80% of the market capitalization of the entire tech industry. So they were at a level of dominance that even Google or Apple today is not even close to at the time. So that's how powerful they were. And so they had a system and it worked really well for like 50 years. They had a system which was. Most of the employees in the company were expected to basically follow rules. So they dressed the same, they acted the same, they did everything out of the playbook. They were trained very specifically but they had this category of people they called Wild Ducks. And this was an idea that the founder Thomas Watson had come up with, Wild Ducks. And the Wild ducks were, they often had the formal title of an IBM fellow and they were the people who could make new things and there were eight of them. And they got to break all the rules and they got to invent new products. They got to go off and work on something new. They didn't have to report back. They got to pull people off of other projects to work with them. They got budget when they needed it. They reported directly to the CEO, they got whatever they needed. He supported them in doing it. And they were glass breakers. And the one in Austin at the time was this guy Andy Heller. And he would show up in jeans and cowboy boots and amongst an ocean of men in blue suits, white shirts, red ties and put his cowboy boots up on the table and it was fine for Andy Heller to do that. And it was not fine for you to do that, right. And so they very specifically identified, we have almost like an aristocratic class within our company that gets to play by different rules. Now the expectation is they deliver, right? Their job is to invent the next breakthrough product. But we, IBM management, know that the 6000 person division is not going to invent the next product. We know it's going to be crazy. Andy Heller in his cowboy boots. And so I was always very impressed. Again, ultimately, IBM had its issues, but that model worked for 50 years. Right? Like, worked incredibly well. And I think that's basically the model that works. But it's a paradox, right? Which is like, how do you have a large, bureaucratic, regimented organization, whether it's academia or government or business or anything, that has all these rule followers in it and all these people who are jealous of their status and don't want things to change, but then still have that spark of creativity? I would say mostly it's impossible. Mostly it just doesn't happen. Those people get driven out. And in tech, what happens is those people get driven out because we will fund them. These are the people we fund. Andrew Huberman: I was going to say, rather, that you are in the business of finding and funding the wild ducks. Marc Andreessen: The wild ducks. That's exactly right. And actually, this is actually, close the loop. This is actually, I think, the simplest explanation for why IBM ultimately caved in, and then HP sort of in the 80s also caved in. IBM and HP kind of were these incredible, monolithic, incredible companies for 40 or 50 years, and then they kind of both caved in. In the actually, think it was the emergence of venture capital, it was the emergence of a parallel funding system where the wild ducks, or in HP's case, their superstar technical people, could actually leave and start their own companies is, and again, it goes back to the university discussion we're having is like, this is what doesn't exist at the university level. This certainly does not exist at the government level. Andrew Huberman: And until recently in media, it didn't exist until there's this thing that we call podcasts. Marc Andreessen: Exactly right. Andrew Huberman: Which clearly have picked up some momentum, and I would hope that these other wild duck models will move quickly. Marc Andreessen: Yeah, but the one thing you know, and you know this, the one thing you know is the people on the other side are going to be mad as hell. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, they're going to, well, I think they're past denial. The counterarguments continue. The name calling is prolific. Marc Andreessen: Name calling is fully underway. Andrew Huberman: Well, Marc, we've covered a lot of topics, but as with every time I talk to you, I learn oh, so very much. I'm so grateful for you taking the time out of your schedule to talk about all of these topics in depth with us. I'd be remiss if I didn't say that. It is clear to me now that you are hyper realistic about the landscape, but you are also intensely optimistic about the existence of wild ducks and those around them that support them and that are necessary for the implementation of their ideas at some point. And that also, you have a real rebel inside you. So that is oh, so welcome on this podcast. And it's also needed in these times and every time. So on behalf of myself and the rest of us here at the podcast, and especially the listeners, thank you so much. Marc Andreessen: Thanks for having me.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an Ask Me Anything episode, or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feeds-- YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere. We also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere, research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny Foundation has agreed to match that amount. So now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one-time payment. And again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium. For those of you that are already subscribers to the premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium subscription feed. And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you. So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about nature, in particular about the scientifically-supported benefits of getting outdoors into nature. The person asks about the role of sunlight, the role of calming sounds, the role of observing wildlife, of observing green colors, and, quote, "other stuff." And in fact, I'm glad that they asked about "other stuff" because I get the question about the scientifically-supported benefits of nature a lot. I often also get the question about grounding. For those of you that aren't familiar with what grounding is, grounding is a practice of putting your feet on the Earth directly with bare feet, oftentimes into soil or on a lawn. And it's a question that I seem to get more and more. In fact, every week for quite a long while now, on social media or elsewhere, somebody asks me about the scientific support for this practice of grounding. So obviously there's a lot of interest in what the scientific research says about getting into nature and putting one's feet on the ground, a.k.a. grounding, and so on. OK, so if I'm going to answer this question, I first have to be very direct with you. There is excellent, meaning dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies which support the value of getting sunlight in one's eyes, in particular early in the day to set your circadian rhythm. This is something that I've talked about extensively on the Huberman Lab podcast and as a guest on other podcasts. It's one of the first and, frankly, most important items on the toolkit for sleep, which is a zero-cost toolkit that you can access by going to hubermanlab.com, going to the menu, going to Newsletter. You can see it as a PDF there. You don't have to sign up for the newsletter. You can just access that toolkit for sleep. And you'll notice that very close to the top of that list, if not top of that list, is to get sunlight in your eyes early in the day. You don't have to see the sun cross the horizon. If you can, that's great. But if you wake up after the sun has already risen, go outside, face the sun, blink as necessary to protect your eyes, but get some sunlight into your eyes every single day or as often as you possibly can, especially on overcast days. That's an absolutely unequivocally science-supported tool that will increase daytime mood, focus, and alertness and will improve your nighttime sleep. Viewing morning sunlight also has profoundly positive effects on metabolism. Now, those effects on metabolism could be the direct effect of viewing sunlight or, more likely, they are the indirect consequence of getting better sleep at night. So getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and ideally in the evening or late afternoon before the sun sets is a very well supported protocol that we know is beneficial for numerous aspects of mental health, physical health, and performance. And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes does require that you get outside. You simply will not derive the same benefits from viewing sunlight if you try and do it through a window or windshield or if you look at a picture of a sun on a screen. Forget it. You are not going to set your circadian rhythm. You are not going to derive all the positive effects of sunlight by trying to get it from screens or from looking at pictures of suns or something of that sort. Now, if you are somebody that, for whatever reason-- seasonality, where you live on the planet, work schedule, et cetera-- who cannot get sunlight in your eyes early in the day on a consistent basis, well, then you might consider purchasing a so-called SAD lamp, which is for seasonal affective disorder, which is very bright light that you can look at in the morning for usually about 5 to 10 minutes. People will put it on their counter while they make their morning coffee, eat their breakfast. And that has also been shown to improve mood, focus, and alertness and set one's circadian rhythm. But it is not nearly as effective as getting sunlight in your eyes. Now, why am I talking about this practice that I've already talked about extensively on numerous podcasts before? Well, because the question is about nature, and sunlight is a key feature of our natural environment. But the person is also asking about other features of nature-- seeing green colors, or blue colors, or running streams for that matter. Well, here, too, we can ask, what does the scientific data really say about things like going near a waterfall, or a running stream, or being near an ocean? And actually, this is quite interesting. There is actually a peer-reviewed literature on negative ionization, as it's called, which is a pattern of ionization that's present close to bodies of water and particular types of bodies of water, such as waterfalls, running streams, et cetera. There's actually a laboratory at Columbia University School of Medicine that has published fairly extensively on the health benefits of negative ionization as it relates to setting circadian rhythm and some other aspects of mental and physical health. I intend to host the head of that laboratory on the Huberman Lab podcast in the not too distant future. For now, we can safely say this-- there does seem to be some positive health benefits to placing oneself near bodies of water, in particular moving bodies of water. And of course, as is always the case when there's a discovery about how the natural world can impact health, there have been some technologies developed to create negative patterns of ionization within a home environment. But as with viewing sunlight exposure and comparing it to, say, SAD lamps, the negative ionization machines that one can purchase and put in their home environment have been shown in a few studies to produce some positive health benefits. But those positive effects in no way reach the level of positive effects that have been demonstrated in studies where people are actually spending a dedicated period of time outdoors as near a moving body of water. So in thinking about nature, natural environments, there's strong evidence for getting sunlight in one's eyes. There is some evidence for being near moving bodies of water, perhaps-- again, I really want to highlight perhaps-- because of negative ionization created by those moving bodies of water. There is far less evidence for sunlight simulators or negative ionization machines used indoors. And then the asker of this question also, quite correctly, asked about things like calming sounds, watching wildlife, green colors, et cetera. And herein lies a really important point for everyone to digest. While, of course, answering a question about the natural world or about health requires that we first pose a hypothesis-- for those of you that aren't familiar what a hypothesis is, a hypothesis is a stated prediction. So it's not a question. A question would be something like, is getting out into nature good for our health? A scientific hypothesis is where one actually takes a stance. For instance, you could take the stance and make the hypothesis that getting out into nature for 30 minutes per day, three days per week, improves mood and nighttime sleep. So that's a hypothesis that then one would go on to design an experiment to test and then evaluate the data from that experiment and compare it to the hypothesis, either validating or negating that hypothesis. That's essentially how science is done. There's a lot more to it, but that's essentially the scientific method. And while, of course, the scientific method is a fabulously powerful tool, for some questions, it is a less potent tool. And the question of is getting out into nature helpful for enhancing our mental and physical health is the sort of question that while ideally you could design a really well controlled study to address, it's actually quite difficult to design such a study. And here's why. In order to perform a study that's very well controlled, meaning where you can isolate individual variables-- like sunlight, like the sorts of color contrast that one sees in a natural scene outdoors in a forest or near a river-- in order to address whether or not the calming sounds or the presence of squirrels running through your environment are the relevant factors, it becomes incredibly difficult to try and isolate individual variables, meaning as soon as you bring people into the laboratory, yes, you have more control over which variables, as they're called, you present them, by bringing them into a room that essentially has no art on the walls and then having them look at a picture of a sun or looking at sunlight or listening to soothing sounds or looking at a picture of a forest, of course, you're controlling the individual variables. However, there is a sort of gestalt, meaning a collective picture of being in nature that brings together lots of different elements-- the element of surprise, for instance. The other day I was out for a Sunday hike, and that morning I saw a squirrel running across my path, and it was interesting because the squirrel had a pinecone in its mouth. It had been chewed down to the cob. And the squirrel was probably only about 7 or 8 inches long, and the pine cone was probably about 9 or 10 inches long-- the cob of the pine cone, that is. And the interesting thing is that the squirrel was carrying it long ways from the tip of the cob. And so I delighted in the fact that this little squirrel was working so hard to carry this object through the woods. And this object was literally longer than its own body length, and it looked so dedicated in its running across the path in order to do whatever it would with that pine cone cob. So something like that obviously stuck in my memory. It delighted me. And at the very same time, there were a number of other things happening besides the presence of that novel wildlife experience. There was the sound of a stream. There's the sunlight. There's the color contrast everywhere. I'm breathing fresh air because I was far away from any cars or any civilization, in fact. And so here's what we know. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of studies that show that if people get out of doors into nature-- this could be parks. This could be near a stream. This could be an ocean, any number of different natural environments. And if they do that for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, three to seven days per week, indeed there are demonstrated significant reductions in things like blood pressure, resting heart rate, improvements in sleep, improvements in mood. And so I think we can very reliably say that, yes, or perhaps even absolutely yes, getting outside into nature can enhance various aspects of mental health, physical health, and thereby performance in different aspects of life. However, when talking about the benefits of getting into nature, we are talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of variables, some of which we are aware of, such as the presence of wildlife or sunlight or color contrast. And then, of course, there are going to be dozens, if not hundreds, maybe even thousands of other variables that we're not even aware of. Perhaps it's negative ionization. Most people aren't measuring the ionization of the air when they go out into nature. But perhaps it's also the presence of certain smells from the soils that are being broken down and then they're changing the oxygenation state of the air around you, the plants, et cetera. Again, so many variables, that, frankly, to try and isolate any one of those variables in the laboratory seems not just artificial, but I think that it actually would just lead to a diminished sense of just how valuable nature is. So while, of course, the Huberman Lab podcast is a podcast where we always center on science and science-related tools, meaning protocols that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies that have been subjected to control conditions where some people are getting, say, the drug treatment or taking the supplement or doing a particular behavioral practice and other people are not or doing some variant of those and dose response curves, all of that stuff, when it comes to the question of whether or not it's valuable to get out into nature, I think it's a very straightforward yes. Absolutely yes. Get out into nature as often as you can and safely can, of course. I realize some of this is weather permitting. People live in different areas. Some people are in cities. Some people are in deserts. Some people are near the ocean. But getting out into nature has been shown over and over again to have numerous positive health effects. And yet, unless we're talking about sunlight exposure and isolating the variable of setting one's circadian rhythm by viewing sunlight early in the day, all of the other features of getting out into nature, things like forest bathing-- this is a term coined from some, frankly, pretty nice studies that were done in Japan in which people placed themselves into forest-like environments for a certain period of time. There were control groups where people were not placed into those environments, and the people that did this so-called forest bathing experienced enhanced mental and physical health. That brought on a practice of people who could not get out of doors into forests bringing plants into their home environment, which I think all of us would agree look nice. They often will add pleasant odors to the air, and perhaps they do actually shift our mental and physical health in significant ways. I suppose it depends on how much you like plants, how much you pay attention to them, and, of course, how many plants there are. But-- and I think this is a really important "but" to emphasize-- while most all questions about tools and protocols for enhancing health immediately lead me to say, ah, this study or that study or, yes, there's evidence or, no, there isn't evidence, when it comes to questions about nature and grounding in particular, I take the stance that this is a unique instance where we know there are just so many benefits of getting out into nature that trying to isolate any one of those variables in a quality, rigorous way within the laboratory almost seems too artificial to really justify the conclusions that arrive. Now, I'm sure there are some of you out there who are aware-- and if you're not, I'll tell you-- there are studies that have explored this practice of so-called grounding. They've had people come into the laboratory and place their feet on soil that is contained within a box or there are other studies where they actually have people go out of doors and place their feet onto the grass or the ground. And there are a bunch of theories as to how grounding could improve one's mental and physical health that aren't just about getting outside. So the theories go that this has to do with the exchange of electrons with the Earth and the Earth's surface in particular. There's been the argument made that shoes, in particular shoes that have rubber soles, may block some of this electron exchange with the surface of the Earth. There have been theories about the tactile-- that is, the touch sensation-- with the Earth being important. Not a lot of science published in, let's just say, blue ribbon journals, which is not to diminish some of the journals that these have been published in, but just to say that, again, there are so many variables associated with a practice such as grounding that I'll simply say, yes, please do get out of doors into nature. I try every Sunday to do my zone 2 cardio by rucking or jogging or hiking, often with other people if I'm trying to be social with family or others. But the point is getting out of doors has myriad positive effects on mental health and physical health. And of course, when you're moving out of doors, you're also getting that zone 2 cardio or other forms of physical benefit by elevating your heart rate or perhaps you could even do your resistance training out of doors on other days. Now, I also try to get out of doors other days of the week. But oftentimes, I'm, by way of weather or by way of other commitments, forced to be indoors, on planes, here at the podcast studio where certainly I'm indoors. But I try and get out of doors at least a few minutes each day for a morning stroll, looking at sunlight, et cetera. So the long and short of this is, yes, there's some evidence for grounding. Is it super strong evidence? No, it's not. We don't really know what it is about placing one's feet onto the Earth that is producing the positive effects that were observed in those studies. And those studies made some reasonable attempt to isolate the variables and figure out whether or not it was ion exchange with the Earth or the tactile, meaning the touch sensation, of having one's feet on the ground. Frankly, I don't think there's enough quality science to really draw any firm conclusions about that. However, if you like the idea of grounding, by all means, do it. In fact, if it feels good to you, I recommend getting your morning sunlight out of doors with your bare feet on the ground. Or if you're like me, you put on your shoes, and you take a walk most days. Although, I've tried this practice of grounding, and it feels pretty good, meaning it feels nice to have my feet on the Earth, provided I'm on clean soil or clean lawn. Definitely don't do this at the dog park. Hookworm is a real thing, by the way, folks. So pay attention to the sorts of surfaces that you're putting your feet onto. But the question about whether or not nature is valuable for our mental and physical health is an easy one. It's an absolute yes. But isolating the particular variables about nature that are most beneficial, well, that's a much tougher question, and it's one that, frankly, the scientific method is not and, to be honest, I don't think ever will be in a position to isolate and really nail down specifically, because as soon as you get specific about that question, you start to diminish the value of the study itself. So the long and short of this is get out into nature as often as you safely can. If you can exercise out of doors, even better. If you want to make it social, great. If you don't want to make it social, fine. It's your life. It's up to you. But there certainly is value in getting out into nature. It's also just beautiful from a visual perspective, from an auditory perspective. And I myself try and take at least a few trips each year. None of these are particularly expensive trips where I try and get out hiking, camping. The weekly walks in nature are an absolute must for me. If I miss one because of weather conditions or travel, I make it a point to try and get into nature more during the following week or whenever I can. And frankly, I don't have a scientific explanation for why nature is oh-so beneficial, except for the sunlight piece and perhaps this grounding piece and the negative ionization piece. And frankly, I don't worry so much about the lack of variable-isolating, quality, peer-reviewed studies that support the benefits of getting out into nature. I simply like getting out into nature and into different natural environments as much as I possibly can, because, for whatever reason, imagine those reasons have something to do with serotonin, dopamine, hormones, oxytocin, probably a bunch of different things that are rooted in how our nervous system evolved in natural environments. Well, it just feels really good. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research-- in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically one research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals
Published: 2023-08-28 12:00:15 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I describe science-based protocols to set and achieve your goals in a way that maximizes the likelihood of reaching them. I explain how to define a priority and reach a specific goal by systematically assessing the challenge level, measurability, milestones, and action states needed to make progress from start to finish. I also explain research-supported tools to improve your performance during cognitive or physical goal work — including directed visualization, variable reward timing, and optimizing your physical environment. I also dispel common myths about goal setting and achievement. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit of zero-cost strategies for goal-setting, goal-pursuit, and goal-completion that can be applied to any physical or cognitive endeavor.

Title: Dr. David Linden: Life, Death & the Neuroscience of Your Unique Experience
Published: 2023-08-21 12:00:02 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Linden, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author of many popular books about the brain. We discuss individual differences between people — focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden’s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function, and epigenetic inheritance and ought to be of interest to all interested in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr David Linden Dr David Linden is a professor of neuroscience at John's Hopkins school of medicine his laboratory has studied neuroplasticity that is how Connections in the Brain Change in response to experience much of that work focused on a structure called the cerebellum which is also sometimes referred to as the mini brain because it looks like a mini brain in the bottom and back of the human brain and it's responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our motor behavior that is our ability to walk and talk but also dance play instruments and it's responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our sense of balance our ability to learn new motor behaviors as well as our sense of timing today we will discuss the cerebellum and what it does but Dr David Lindon will also teach us about the important sense of touch as well as what makes us different as individuals the reason today's discussion encompasses so many important topics is that Dr David lindon's laboratory has focused on many of those topics and he is also the author of five excellent popular books about Neuroscience that focus on for instance our sense of pleasure and where it originates from and what controls it in the brain as well as our sense of touch and today we start off our discussion by talking about the recent discovery of a set of neurons that have been known about for a long period of time but that only recently have been characterized that are involved in sensual touch in particular and it's a fascinating conversation I assure you in addition to that Dr David lynon informs us about what makes us individuals how each and every one of us perceives the same things differently and it's an absolutely fascinating conversation which tells you for instance why some of you think a smell is putrid indeed smells like vomit whereas others perhaps are not bothered by that smell and why others still are attracted to that smell or something that you look at or something that you hear we also talk about nature versus nurture and how we come to be who we are not just through our genes and epigenetics but also through our early childhood experience and adult experience and then in the latter third of our conversation we shift to talking about the so-called mindbody connection and the science underlying how our thoughts inform our bodily health or lack thereof as well as how the organs of our body control the chemicals hormones and thoughts within our brain then we shift to discussing Dr David lynon himself and the fact that in 2020 he was diagnosed with a form of heart cancer that led his Physicians to tell him that he had 6 to 12 months to live now obviously because he was in our studio to record this conversation he has outlived that prognos nois but he lives dayto day with the knowledge that his death may very well come soon although it isn't clear exactly when that day will come of course he tells us how the initial prognosis of his cancer as well as outliving that prognosis has informed his day-to-day life as well as his thinking and his relationships and that leads to a very direct and frankly emotional conversation that includes advice on how all of us can get the most out of our daily living and out of our overall life it's an extremely powerful conversation that I believe everyone regardless of age or health status can benefit from and it's one that makes clear that not only is Dr David Lindon a spectacular scientist but also a spectacular educator a spectacular popular writer a spectacular Family Man including husband and father and friend to many people and his colleagues but he is also a courageous and spectacularly generous human being before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roka Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind now I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roa understands those challenges and the biology the visual system such that they've designed sunglasses and Eyeglasses that always allow you to see with Crystal clarity now initially Roa ey glasses and sunglasses were designed for sports performance and as a consequence all of their glasses are designed to be very lightweight and to not slip off your face if you get sweaty however the design of the glasses incl includ some that are specifically for sport and others whose aesthetic really allows you to use them for sport as well as out to dinner or to work etc and that's how I use them if you'd like to try Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses you can go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's Roa r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long-term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations as well as food timing and things like exercise combined to impact your blood glucose levels I started using levels a little over a year ago and it gave me a lot of insight into how specific Foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy and in doing so it really allowed me to optimize how I eat what I eat when I exercise and so on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels. l/ huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. linkl nk/ huberman to get two free months of membership we are always striving to make the hubman Lab podcast better and to that end we need your help over the next month we are going to be carrying out a survey the purpose of the survey is to improve the hubman Lab podcast according to your feedback we put together a brief survey to understand what you love about the podcast hopefully you love a few things at least or maybe just one thing as well as what you think could be improved or perhaps the many things that you think could be improved about the hubman Lab podcast basically what we are asking is to get your feedback so that we can improve any and all things about the huberman Lab podcast the survey does not take long and every single response will be reviewed as a thank you for completing the survey we are offering two months free of the hubman lab premium channel if you're already a member of the Hub lab premium channel do not worry you will get an additional two free months for carrying out this survey you can find the link to the survey in the show notes for this podcast episode and on our website huberman lab.com so if you would be so kind as to take a few minutes to fill out the survey and help us continue with bringing you the best possible content here at The hubman Lab podcast and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with Dr David Lynden Professor Lyndon welcome thanks so much for having me been looking forward to our conversation and we have a lot to talk about we do lots of different aspects of science lots of different aspects of personal journey and what you're confronting now as it relates to your health and your future I want to start off with a question that I learned from the one and only the great Carl daero who was the first guest on this podcast my colleague at Stanford and for those of you that don't recognize Carl's name he is a absolute Phenom he's is a uh active clinical psych psychiatrist so he's an MD and he also is um a bioengineer who's developed a lot of the modern tools for probing the brain and um anytime I've met with Carl the first thing he says is what do you most excited about lately that's a good question it is uh so I'm going to steal that approach and say what are you most excited about lately well very very lately the most interesting thing that that I read in Neuroscience is the answer to a uh a scientific problem that I think is really dear to a lot of people's hearts and that is what are the nerve endings in the genitals that are responsible for sexual sensation and you know if you think about it right people can feel sexy from being touched on lots of different parts of the body but there's something special about the genitals doesn't matter male or female or interex or gay or straight or by or whatever you are you know the genitals are are a hot spot and why and you you'd think as biologists we' know this by now this would be something we could just answer but but it's been a mystery for a long time and if if you go back to to 1860 there was a German neuroanatomist named Krauss and he cut thin sections of tissue from the penis and the clitoris and he looked at them under the microscope and he saw a particular kind of nerve ending there that has since been called The Krauss cor pusle and there were lots of them in these two places and so he thought well maybe this is the cellular basis of sexual sensation maybe these are the particular nerve endings that are responsible uh for this um but there were some things that that were in favor of that and some not so these nerve endings are also in some other places that people can find more or less sexy like they're in the nipples and they're in the lips and they're in the anus all places that get popular in uh in that domain but they're also in places like the cornea or the lining of the joints so the distribution doesn't quite make sense and so it was never known and so in if you wanted to really test as a scientist whether these nerve endings are responsible you want to record their electrical signals while the genitals are being touched you'd want to inactivate these cells and see if you could interfere with with uh sexual sensation and this in a preprint from David ginty's group at Harvard is just what they have been able to do in mice they found a way to label and record from and activate and inactivate artificially uh The Krauss cor pusles and so you see a nerve ending in the skin it could be conveying all kinds of information it could be tuned for hot or for cold or for itch or for pain or for or for inflammation or for mechanical sensation stretching uh vibration indentation and sure enough when they recorded from these Krauss cor pusles they really are uh mechanical sensors as you would expect uh if if they were involved in sexual sensation so that was good and then uh the other thing then that they did is they they tried to artificially turn them on and so the way they did that is they Ed genetic tricks to express one of Carl Dao's uh uh molecule that activates neurons when they're when blue light is shown on them and they found that if they express uh uh this artificial protein in the crow cells in a in a male Mouse and then shine blue light the mouse gets an erection all right so far so good what happens if you turn them off well if you turn them off in a male Mouse it's just as interested in females when they're in heat but it won't mount and thrust and ejaculate as much and if you turn them off in a female Mouse during the time of her cycle where she would normally be sexually receptive uh you find that she is less interested she's much less likely to let him Mount she's much less likely to let him finish so this is the remarkable result that uh finally after all these years since 1860 now we know what the nerve endings are that convey sexual sensation and like all good science then you know there are a lot of questions that are really interesting to our everyday lives like you know people like different things in bed and have different propensity for orgasm or or like like to be touched in different ways well is part of that reason because of individual variation in their cruss cor pusle structure um we know that sexual sensation diminishes with aging is that in part because kuss cor pussle density is lost from the skin of the genitals and that's a reasonable because we know for example that fine touch sensors in the fingertips uh so-called Merkel and Meisner endings also named after German anatomist like so many things are uh are also lost with age so that's a reasonable idea so so this finding from ginty's Lab has opened up a whole world of science and I've been my my own lab doesn't work on touch but I've been a fanboy of touch for for many many years mostly because where I work at Johns Hopkins Medical School there have been many terrific touch researchers it's been a world center for it and I hear about it over lunch and I got all fired up so years ago I wrote a book about it and I still follow the field and this is the most interesting thing in that field recently and as I recall ginty was your neighbor at Hopkins before he moved to Harvard that's right that's right he was one of the ones ginty uh uh Steven sha uh Michael Katarina Shin Jong dong there have been a number number of world leaders in the in the cellular basis of touch sensation at Hopkins do you recall if in the preprint that you were describing there was an experiment where they activated these Krauss Cor pusles in females it's funny you should mention that I sent that exact email to David giny and they said they are in the process of doing that right now and they don't quite know yet and so I asked him I said so for example is erection of the clitoris even a thing in mice he says well we're really not sure so we're activating the CR core pusles in female mice and we're just kind of staring at it and looking and see if anything happens does there you know does the you know does the the body change shape is there a color change they don't even quite know what it is they're looking for because it's that much on the Leading Edge of things but it's a good question yeah or perhaps the female mice would be more willing to mate outside of the usual time frame of receptivity if uh these kuss cor pusles are are stimulated that's possible my suggestion my my guess would be not because I think that the hormonal regulation of receptivity is like a sledgehammer and very hard to overcome but they might be more willing to continue mating or mate for longer during their uh fertile time and I just want to remind people because we had a a guest recently uh Dr Reena Malik um who's a urologist reproductive and sexual health expert she's an MD and um uh she made clear that the the clitoris and the penis come from the same embryonic origin they are analogous tissues um in um different individuals I do have one more question about this uh sexual touch thing um these are periperal nerves right so these are not of the brain and spinal cord they are in what we call the periphery and my understanding is that peripheral neurons regenerate and can remodel themselves extensively in ways that um neurons within the brain and spinal cord um tend to remodel less especially as one gets older out of the so-called critical period um is it possible that these CR corpuscules and their patterns of innervation within the genitals change according to the stimulation that uh people experience um in other words is sexual sensation experience dependent that is a great question and so we don't know because monitoring this in people is not technically possible Right it requires cadaa tissue so you can only do it once in animals it it it it will be possible and it it could be for a couple of different reasons in other words it could be I think what you're imagining is that there's actual structural plasticity if you looked at these kuss cor pusles or uh that you would actually see them changing their shape or their size or their or their density as a result of experience but uh what can also happen is a phenomena like desensitization uh that is to say when there's stimulation for a long time then uh The receptors transiently can become less sensitive to touch and it's well known uh particularly in males that uh that chronic masturbation can produce desensitization of sexual sensation in the penis and that could be as a result of a physical change a morphological change in the CR cor pusles uh but it's more likely to be a change in their function that you wouldn't be able to Simply see by looking uh at an outline of structure in the microscope such an interesting topic Thanks for opening things up with with that and I'll have to check out this preprint I'm also a huge fan of David ginty's work and and colleagues there are many people involved in uh that domain of work of course I'd like to talk about your recent book and the sort of underlying basis of what led you to write it and what intrigued you about this idea of human individuality the book unique uh is one that we'll provide a link to in the show note captions and um it's a very interesting idea that we are all different um especially coming from a neuroscientist who we were trained at least similarly to learn that sure the bumps and ripples of the brain and the fine wiring of the brain um is different and we are all unique and different we have different shapes AKA morphologies but focusing on human individuality is not something that modern Neuroscience or classic neur science has really done much of it's really focused on how people do X or people do y this way um tell us about unique and tell us about human individuality yeah well I mean you're absolutely right so when I look at the experiments in my own lab how do we do them well we work on mice do we work on mice with genetic variation no we work on highly inbred mice that are designed to be as genetically similar to each other as possible and then we raise them basically in prison in little little cells which may not be a good idea and we try to give them as similar experience as possible they are given toys and food and water but I agree it it resembles um a prison of sorts they aren't free to roam they they're they have nothing like the experience of a wild mouse let me put it that way they're uh uh and and yes there are as you said correctly there are plenty of experiments where there is enrichment uh for mice and and they love it so for example in our lab when we put running wheels in the cages or mice and let them run overnight they're active at night um your average Mouse will run 2 kilometers in a night for a little tiny Mouse and some of the mice are so intense they will run 20 kilomet imagine a mouse doing 20K but but it will happen they really really like it they don't like being in prison they they want to exercise uh and they're really Bor so yes to get back to your general Point uh so much of science is designed to try to find general principles of of function of the brain a physiology of genetics uh and to ignore individual variation but individual variation is so important to our human experience and actually is so important to to the process of evolution in natural elction and how how species uh make their way in the world that that it's it's something that that requires a lot of attention and to me what's really fascinating is that when you look at the variation in the way sense organs function it's almost a miracle that we can agree on a common reality at all even within the human species and this is true of of more of of of some senses more than others obviously in your world in the retina we have various kinds of of loss of color vision uh that are well known and some other more complicated phenomena having to do with uh impairments in the perception of motion uh or form but uh the place where this really happens is in the uh ola system so we have approximately 400 functional receptors for different odorant molecule smells uh in our nose and if you uh sequence the genomes of many people you find that the uh that the the DNA that encodes for these odorant receptors is unusually variable from Individual to individual as a matter of fact if you take two different people on average they will have functional differences in 30% of their odor receptors and if you do as Lesley vosol and her colleagues did at Rockefeller University and give odor tests where they give people different things to smell and then they dilute them and find the Threshold at which they can detect them you find enormous changes from People to People both in term in general terms some people are just better smellers than others but in terms of individual odors as well there's some odors that some people can't detect and other people smell one way for example there is a uh there's a secreted hormone called androne androne there are some people who can't smell it at all for some people uh it smells like rather Pleasant like grass and for some people it smells foul like urine or sweat and it just depends on genetic variation in one particular odorant receptor sorry to interrupt uh another uh phenomenal researcher who studies ol faction among other things Katherine dck um I once heard uh say that some people have a gene that for them makes the smell of microwave popcorn um um they experience that smell as vomit and other people who lack this Gene like the smell of microwave popcorn or at least for them it's not aversive so it can really be a binary response well it can and actually that's a very particular funny case so the the relevant chemical there is buic acid and also isovic acid and so uh there are uh researchers I think Rachel Herz uh is one of them who have given a mixture of these two chemicals to people and if they say this is parmesan cheese they go oh yeah that's parmesan cheese and if they give it to other people and say this is vomit they'll go oh yeah that's vomit and if they tell people they give them one vial and say this is peran shees and they go yeah and they give them another one they say it's vom they go yeah and then they say well actually we fooled you it was the same vial they say no you didn't you must have made a mistake they're convinced that they couldn't have been the same thing so this points out not only is there genetic variation that uh is responsible individuals perceive odor but we are incredibly suggestible in terms of odors and we we are very dependent upon them in terms of cultural context uh and and this can be this can be learned and and this is Central to our Humanity in the sense that that we humans are what I like to call the anti- pandas uh pandas live in one spot uh in in southern China and they eat one thing bamboo and that's it humans are the opposite humans can live in any ecological niche in the world from the tropics to the poles and humans eat a wide wide wide variety of foods and as a result it means that we have have to have a very plastic old factory system there have to be very few things that we find innately aversive there are only a handful of odors rotting meat odors uh molecules with the evocative names like cadaverine and putene are things that even babies when they're newborn find aversive but other things happen that they need to be learned for example um pretty much every adult finds poop odors uh unpleasant but babies Happ happily play with their own poop they have to learn that that's disgusting it's not because babies have a different nose it's because they have to learn culturally it's not innate it is not innate um they're only a few innate odor aversions and a few innate taste aversions that were were born with and the other things are elaborated culturally and we can think about this in terms of how we we we we talk about odors so for example we might say vanilla smells sweet well that's weird that's like those are two different senses how can something smell sweet that's like saying it sounds red right it's it's a statement about synesthesia right and but but how did it come to pass and do people say that vanilla smells sweet everywhere in the world well the answer is no so in places in the world where vanilla is used with sugar in in sweet foods like desserts then people say that vanilla smells sweet or mint similarly uh smells sweet if it is typically used together with sugar but if you go to a place like uh uh like Vietnam where mint is mostly used in Savory dishes people won't say that mint smells sweet so there's a pair dissociation there that at least at our level of conscious understanding feeds back onto what we call old factory or smell perception but really it's a it must be a pair dissociation at some point in development yeah it is it absolutely is a pair Association and it's something that goes on continually through your life right I mean lots of people for example uh have stories of foods that they wouldn't eat as a child but they came to like as an adults um a good example of that is coffee uh a lot of people have to overcome bitter aversion to uh to become coffee aicad uh so uh you know this this this feeds into the more the more General theme that there is no pure perception perception is inference it's not like there is a purely objective world that can somehow make its way through the senses and we can perceive that as the truth all of our perception through all of our senses both the outward pointing senses of the world like smell and taste and sight and hearing uh and the inward pointing senses like balance and uh is my stomach full uh and things like that all of them are based on experience and expectation and the situation of the moment as many of you know I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs now of course I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but often times I simply can't get enough servings but with ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress simply put I always feel better when I take ag1 I have more focus and energy and I sleep better and it also happens to taste great for all these reasons whenever I'm asked if you could take Just One supplement what would it be I answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman are there any examples of uniqueness of visual perception that come to mind I recently did a social media post um that involved it was essentially three rings A blue ring um a red ring and a blue ring in the center perhaps it was the other way around excuse me it was red blue red and um I asked which ring is in front or are they all at the in the same plane now of course it's a two-dimensional image right um and interestingly it splits out into about thirds some people see the blue ring in front quite a bit others see a red ring out in front others see them all in the same plane and this uh we think has to do with um differences in two things between individuals one is the distribution of the cone photo receptors um which we know is essentially random between individuals maybe even between the two eyes and then um and that gives rise to this phenomenon of chromatic aberration yes um which is the displacement of the visual image according to the wavelength of the light and we won't get into the physics of it now I'll soon do a post that hopefully distills it in a manner that simple enough that people understand but clearly some people see certain colors in front of others MH um and the person right next to them could see the opposite color in front and others say what are you talking about all the colors are in exactly the same plane of of vision um so that's the one that I know um I'm guessing you know some others and perhaps some more robust ones well I think you know perhaps this is maybe not what you had in mind but one way in which experience modifies the visual world has to do with how much light you're exposed to in the first five years or so of your life and so kids that don't get outside are much more likely to be myopic and it actually ised near yes uh uh when they grow up uh than kids who got outside and we now know that at least part of the story is that light seems to stimulate the um expression of a class of molecules called trophic factors that you're well acquainted with that actually change the shape of the eyeball so it's not really the structure of the retina or the lens of the cornea the actual degree of elongation of the eyeball changes changing the way the the retina sits relative to the lens and that seems to be light dependent early in life and uh which gives rise to uh uh to uh a higher incidence of myopia and and to me this is really well first of all it's it's it's news you can use you should get your kids outside absolutely all kinds of reasons and you should get outside too especially in the morning set that circadian rhythm I I know that's a famous huberman esque uh uh uh point they're gonna be putting me in the grave David and I'm going to be telling people to uh or it'll maybe it'll be on my Tombstone he'll say get get sunlight in your eyes especially especially on cloudy days because there is still sunlight even if you can't see the physical object of the sun on cloudy days well you know I think this whole idea of having traits that are dependent upon early life experience is fascinating because there are a number of situations where you would guess that something is genetic but it isn't it's actually dependent on early life experience and there's a there's an amazing story about this having to do with the early days of World War II so in the early days of World War II the Japanese Army just swept through Asia they defeated the the British and Malaysia and Singapore they over in Thailand and Burma and they knocking on the gates of India and everything was going great except the Japanese Army had a problem there were an enormous number of their soldiers who became incapacitated with heat stroke they got their core temperature got too hot and uh when the Army doctors uh examine them they found this was much more likely to happen in solders uh who came from the northern part of Japan Hokkaido where it's uh where it snows in the winter as opposed to the southern part of Japan like kushu which is a semi-tropical environment and the classical explanation the biologists like us would guess would say oh all right well this has happened genetically over many years uh you have a family that's been in kushu for many generations and you've selected four Gene variants to allow you to tolerate the heat better and we know actually what this is so if you're more heat tolerant it's because you have more of a particular class of sweat gland called the echine sweat glands the sort of saltwater sweat glands not the lipid stinky armpit sweat glands called the arrine ones the acine ones you have a higher fraction of them that are inovated meaning that the signals from your brain that say your core is too hot can then make you sweat so the total density of sweat glands between northern and southern soldiers in Japan wasn't different but the southern soldiers tend to have a higher degree of intervation all right so they said okay well this happened genetically over many generations but if you look at those rare cases where you have soldiers from a long-established northern family and their parents moved South and then they grew up in the southern location they had high sweat gland inovation they were well heat tolerant conversely if you had a wellestablished southern kushu family and they moved to Hokkaido and then had their child that child developed the northern sweat gland inovation pattern so meaning less nerve inovation of those sweat glands as you mentioned before just as many sweat glands just less nerve inovation therefore those sweat glands could not be activated they couldn't dump heat as well their heat tolerance was lower correct exactly right and and what's what's what's wonderful is that this gives an advantage that you can't get through evolution and that it can happen right away in this in in one generation right evolutionary change is slow right and you can adapt as a species and as a family over over many many many generations but when you have a phenomenon that is set by uh early life experience well then you can benefit from that early life experience within your own life it's not that your great great great great great grandchildren will ultimately benefit you benefit another wonderful example of this uh comes from field mice vs and we were talking earlier about how we both worked with uh the scientist IR zuker at uh at Berkeley who was a specialist in uh in in inv Vols and uh what people found is that if you take uh wild caught uh field mice and uh you have uh a pregnant mothers and you have them in the lab but you manipulate the lights so that uh you have artificial spring in other words day length is getting longer day after day during the pregnancy then what happens is when their pups were are born they will have a low density of fur anticipating summer temperatures uh if you however uh put them in artificial fall where day length is getting shorter uh they will be born now with high density of for anticipating winter temperatures and of course you can do this no matter what the season actually is in the world by manipulating these lights in the lab and so like the sweating Japanese soldiers this is a great example of early life plasticity and just the sort of trait that if you ask someone they would probably guess is heritable but actually is not thanks for mentioning Irv zuker who uh you also mentioned was an adviser to us both who's done incredible work in circadian biology seasonal rhythms hormones and behavior I have such reverence for Irvin the experiment you mentioned made me smile wide because it's uh but one of gosh maybe hundreds of incredible studies so if people are interested in seasonal rhythms and circadian rhythms and biology of the most interesting kind definitely check out Irving zuker's work at at Berkeley we I'll provide a link to to his uh PubMed there since we've been taking a tour of individual variation in ol Factory perception visual perception and uh now heat tolerance um I have to ask are you aware of any examples off the top of your head um in the auditory domain that particularly Intrigue you yeah well I would say one really interesting example has to do with perfect pitch So Perfect Pitch as a trait that is to say uh you have the ability uh to to hear a note played and say oh that's a c right this is a pretty rare trait so even if you look among highly trained musicians if you went to Peabody conservatory at my University Johns Hopkins and tested people there you would find a higher incidence of Perfect Pitch than you would in the general population but still maybe one in 10 trained musicians have perfect pitch and parenthetically having Perfect Pitch doesn't NE necessarily make you a better musician uh but it's an interesting phenomena and so the question is well is perfect pitch heritable and the answer is when you look at twin studies where which is what we use to estimate heritability the answer is it's kind of low there's a heritable component but it accounts for uh my recollection is on the on the order of 30 40% of the variability in Perfect Pitch however if people receive ear training starting at a young age the chance that they will develop Perfect Pitch can improve drastically in your book unique uh do you cover aspects of human individuality that extend beyond the perception domain um into the cognitive domain well yeah absolutely and uh you know I think I think it's good to set the stage here if we're going to be talking about heritability and human individuality and and so if I can go off on a little bit of a riff uh uh for the benefit of your of your listeners and viewers here pleas so if you look at human traits whether they are behavioral traits like shyness or very straightforward morphological traits like height uh what you tend to find is that there are very few traits that are entirely heritable where all their variability can be predicted based on the gene variance you get from your mother and father and there are a few traits that are absolutely UNH heritable but that most fall in between so let me give an example everyone in the world has either wet or dry ear wax and it turns out that this is determined by variation in a single Gene the name of the gene is boring it's abcc1 uh it's a ion transporter and uh there's a variation in this Gene gives rise to either wet or dry ear wax it doesn't matter how your parents raised you it doesn't matter what foods you ate growing up doesn't matter what what uh uh diseases your mother had when you were in the womb it's 100% heritable well does this mean that abcc1 we should call it the ear wax type Gene well no because it's not there just for that like this this Gene is expressed in cells in all parts of the body doing all kinds of things ear wax is just something that we notice genes don't code for traits they code for proteins and so we have to be careful about how we refer to them in that way um for example the wet ear wax G uh variant of the abcc 11 Gene also confers a slightly higher risk for breast cancer H uh so clearly it's not just for ear wax it's it's for a bunch of things most of which we don't yet know about but in the case of earwax this trait is 100% heritable at the other end of the scale speech accent is zero% heritable it is entirely dependent upon the speech that you experience uh in your childhood and interestingly it's the speech of your peers more than the speech of your family which which is why the children of immigrants sound like the place where they wound up not like their parents uh and there is no evidence for any degree of heritability now just to be clear I'm talking about speech accent like whether you have a high or a low voice or it's nasal or more or less resonant these are physical things having to do with the vocal tract and they are in part heritable Okay so we've got one thing that's 100% heritable one thing that's 0% heritable but where do most Things Fall most Things fall in the middle uh uh one of the most heritable traits that we know about in humans is height and in the United States height is about 85% heritable 85% of the variation in the trade of height can be explained uh by what you inherit from your mother and your father well what's the rest well it's nutrition it's the diseases you fought off it's also random variation which we'll talk about a lot later um now you might say okay well that's an estimate for people in the US is this true all over the world well no if you go to a place where people routinely don't get enough nutrition and are routinely fighting off infectious diseases like this has been studied in rural Bolivia for example or rural India now height is no longer 85% heritable it's only 50% heritable why because people in these situations where they don't get enough nourishment where they're fighting off these diseases can't live up to their genetic potential for height if you want to make things better for the people of the world then everyone needs to have basic things like the ability to learn and enough nutrition and and decent Medical Care and schools in order to fulfill their genetic potential for positive traits and uh height I've used as an example because it is very uncontroversial but we could apply the very same analysis to intelligence general intelligence now there are people who argue about do things like I Q tests really measure anything real and there's been a lot of fighting in the scientific literature about this but I think intelligence tests aren't perfect and they are sometimes culture bound but they are actually quite predictive of of of of later success and uh much more so than say sat tests or GRE tests or mcats or other standardized tests but presumably those correlate in some way they do I do but but but the IQ tests are better actually they talking about this the the classic IQ test uh I am talking about the modern variants of the classic IQ test that are administered by trained psychologists uh and aren't just a paper form and so they're not perfect and no test will be perfect but they're pretty good and so then if you ask the question what is the heritability for IQ test score uh well the answer tends to be different depending upon the population if you look uh again in in countries like the us or in Western Europe that are fairly affluent where where people uh tend to have good access to to nutrition and medical care and schooling and kids get to play and they're not and they're not traumatized by War then uh then IQ test score is heritable in the ballpark of 60 70% but if you look at people who don't have those benefits who are poor and this can be in the United States as well if you look at uh communities that that uh face discrimination and have consistently poor poor health care in schools then IQ is less heritable why for the very same reason that it is in Heights because people can't live up to their genetic potential when they don't have the basic things that everybody needs so presumably if two identical twins and I realize they aren't identical but you're familiar with twins you have twin children um if two identical twins are raised separately uh the correlation in their IQ is can only is it that only 60 I think you said about 66% of their IQ can be predicted on the basis of their genetic makeup Alone um I mean it makes perfect sense to me as to why if one of those twins went to schools that were demanding of you know a lot of different topic matter um and the other one went to schools where the the instruction level was really deficient that one would perform far less well on an IQ test unless of course the IQ test isn't tapping into school-based knowledge it's tapping into some other um thermometer of of so-called intelligence or IQ well you know the thing is that good schools correlate with many other things right so the students that go to good schools aren't just benefiting from good schools they tend to also have good medical care and safer less traumatizing neighborhoods and they're more likely to have books parents with books in the home and uh uh and and a whole number of things that are all beneficial so when you try to do epidemiology on this you have to be aware that things are very deeply interconnected but but you bring up a good point so it turns out that the way we get these estimates of heritability there's two ways one way is to compare so-called identical or monozygotic twins with so-called fraternal or dizygotic twins so the identical twin TS will share nearly 100% of their Gene variant and on average fraternal twins share 50% of their uh of their Gene variants and generally speaking when people do these studies in order to avoid confounds of sex they'll compare same seex fraternal twins so boys to boys and girls to girls uh uh and uh when you put these incidents into a formula called Fisher equation then you can come up with an estimate of the heritability of the trait but there is an assumption present in that and it's called the equal environment assumption you're saying well two kids raised in the same family have the same environments well that's not always true right that can be violated by a number of uh of different situations so it turns out that a more powerful but much more difficult way to estimate heritability is by looking at twins reared apart either identical twins or fraternal twins reared apart and there was a landmark study called the Minnesota study of twins reared apart which is abbreviated mistra that is really the gold standard for assessing the heritability of many different human traits both behavioral traits uh but also disease incidents but of course it's a small n because you know the population of identical twins rear toart that you can get into the lab isn't isn't that large they had something I don't remember the exact numbers but they had something like 80 some uh uh identicals and 50 some fraternal uh in their in their sample but by doing this they were able to come up with a lot of interesting estimates and so for example most uh personality traits uh what the psychologists uh use the acronym ocean to mean openness conscientiousness empathy agreeableness and neuroticism I think I got that right spelled right uh that these traits on average tend to be about 50% heritable and so okay you say all right well 50 50% of those personality traits is heritable the rest has got to be like how you were raised it's got to be in your family and so everyone was shocked when they actually did the analysis um and found that family has almost nothing to do with it and what what are are you kidding it's it's it's it's it's got to and I think the important thing to realize is these traits I just listed you know we call these personality traits but they are not the sum total of the way you are in the world parents can inculcate many things in their children they can demonstrate trades so people are much more likely to go into an occupation if their parents did they can inculcate moral ideas and religious ideas but in terms of these ocean personality traits they have astonishingly little to do with it so then this brings up the question well if 50% of the variation in these personality traits is not from your genetics and it's not from your family where does it come from and the answer seems to be is that it comes from the random nature of the development of the body and the nervous system and this is this is a point that I think many people don't understand this is something that biologists know but we've done a very poor job of communicating to the general public The genome all your DNA all three billion bases of DNA all 19,000 or so genes in a human don't make a blueprint for making your body and brain there it's not a schematic diagram that connects everything to everything particularly in the nervous system where we have these hundreds of trillions of connections rather it's a rather vague recipe so the The genome doesn't say oh okay you glutamate using neuron in the brain region called the thalamus you know grow for 200 microns towards the top and then and then and then cross the midline and then grow towards the ear for you know another distance no it it says something like hey you bunch of glutamate neurons in the thalamus over here in this area about half of you cross the midline and so what does this mean in terms of individual variation what means well for for for some individuals 40% of their axons will cross the midline of the brain and for another individual 60% will even in identical twins and as you correctly said a moment ago identical twins aren't really identical either in their bodies or their temperament so if you take newborn identical twins and you give them a CT scan just to measure the shape of their organs they're not the same you might have one twin whose spleen is 30% larger than the than the other Twins or whose liver is 30% smaller than the other twins even though they have the exact same DNA and they were lying right next to each other in the womb and presumably had the same or very similar fetal environment and the reason is the random or as we say stochastic nature nature of neural development a great way to study this is with nine banded armadillos I know we're getting weird here but I love the armadillo because I've been told tell me I don't want to uh uh interrupt you too long but um as far as I know the only animal in North America that carries leprosy uh that is that is true and um and there's a lot of twinning going on in Armadillos right well what there is is actually quading so armadillos or the nine-banded armadillo in particular and they're different armadillos I'm not really an armadillo specialist so I don't know if this holds for all of them but the nine bounded armadillo is born as identical quadruplets awesome awesome so you can take these identical quadruplet newly born armadillo I don't know you think you call them pups I don't know what a baby armadillo was called I'm sure there's some particular word for it and someone will tell us in the comments on YouTube what is the name of a baby armadillo I know like a feret baby ferrets are kits uh uh the moms are jills the dads are bobs I used to be obsessed with this kind of naming you know it's a it's a business of ferrets or a what is like a gang of raccoons or whatever so if you can tell us what the name is for the baby armadillos as well as what do you call a group of armadillos um you win the pride associated with being right that's right right one of my favorites is an a an ostentation of peacocks amazing or a murder of crows who comes up with this yeah I know it's it's a good or a raft of otter I think it I I think that's correct but uh so if you have four newborn uh identical nine-banded armadillos then this is a great model system that biologists can use to study uh uh uh stochastic differences in development and and sure enough their brains are wired slightly differently their bodies are slightly different if you test them behaviorally even very very early in life they have different propensities some are bolder and will Explore More some are will tend to hide in the corner more and you know we know this from the lab you you get a box of mice that are inbred from the breeder and you pluck them out and they're not behaviorally identical some might try to bite your hand some will run away some will stand stock still where does this Behavioral variation come from in mice that are nearly genetically identical well it comes from a bunch of things they don't always have exactly equal experience but mostly it comes from the pseudo random stochastic nature of development I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tests out there you get information back about blood lipids about hormones and so on but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids what those hormone levels etc mean and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them in are the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term Health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both apob and of insulin which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation if you'd like to try insid tracker you can visit insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off and is the pseudo random stochastic nature of development one of the major major excuse me driving forces for evolution ution because you know we hear about mutations and we always think or people tend to think rather that mutations are bad but of course mutations provide the variation that can also subserve adaptive traits I mean if you're a fan of the X-Men as I am huge fan of the Xmen the entire series every single one including the Wolverine movies you quickly come to learn that genetic mutation is at the heart of variation which is at the heart of individuality which is what we're talking about right and so genetic variation is at the heart IND Duality but there is also there are also these other things right that we've talked about there's the effects of early life experience and there is the stochastic nature of development because if you through the randomness of development happen to have like a particularly great liver you're not going to pass that on to your children right that isn't in your germ line you won't pass that trait along just brief insert here on germline we had odad RFI on the podcast who studies um epigenetic transmission and um and inheritance of uh of of it's not lamaran we have to point that out but um inheritance of of sort of acquired traits it does happen and the germine is the genes that are present in the the sperm and in the eggs all the other uh cells of your body have genes of course but um the best way to put this is uh simply going to the gym and getting fit um does not make your children more fit because the germ line as far as we know is not modified in a direct way uh in other words the DNA within sperm and eggs are not modified according to your behaviors in most but not all cases that's right and and as you uh as you correctly said about od's work and and other people's work there is what's called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which means that you can have traits that are passed not from one generation to the next but even two generations to the grandchildren that don't require modification of DNA but to date that has been shown very convincingly in in worms and in Plants uh the evidence in mammals is is really not there yet in in my opinion and most of the claims for that and it's a very popular thing to say I epigenetically inherited my grandmother's or great-grandmother's trauma uh the evidence at present is is poor actually a lot of it comes from epidemiology most of which came from famines in the overx region of Northern Sweden and they had very good medical records and they said oh well if your grandfather went through the famine then you're more likely to have this trait if you're male or if your grandmother went through this then if you're if you're male you have this trait and your female you have that trait and I mean there are two problems one is that there's not a biological mechanism but the other problem is that the way these things were discovered is by something called harking or hypothesizing after the re results are known uh they did very many statistical comparisons to try to find something significant and you know from your work in the lab that when you do many comparisons you're going to get some things that look significant just occasionally randomly through through through luck and you have to apply a statistical correction called a bon foron correction when you make many particularly post Hawk comparisons after the experiment uh comparisons to set the bar much higher for accepting that data and most of those studies they didn't apply that correction and I remain unconvinced of transgenerational epigenetic in heritance in mammals now let's be clear just because it hasn't been shown convincingly now doesn't mean that it won't be there are some good people working very hard on this and they may well uh describe a mechanism and show this convincingly in the years to come but right now uh you may well inherit your grandma's or great grandma's trauma but you're probably doing it socially not through marks on your DNA that changes how your genes are expressed or not expressed yes so I subscribe to the idea that there is absolutely certainly transgenerational inheritance of parenting and upbringing right I mean your grandparents raise your parents who raise you not always people can be adopted in fact I have adopted members of my family um but if I understand what you're saying correctly the evidence that for instance some stress related Gene was modified during a trauma in my grandparents or great-grandparents and the idea that that was passed to me through my parents that the evidence there is is far weaker right and when you think about it well like how did that happen that had to get into your your grandparents sperm or egg cell and then produce that effect in the brain of your parents and then it had to get into their sperm and or egg cell and then contribute to producing it in you but but fragmentation of DNA in sperm is um or in eggs is is a is a common um thing especially as people age DNA sperm and eggs fragment um and it's possible that some of those mutations still allow for viable embryos so it's in theory The Germ line could be changed by um environmental events well right uh but now I think you're starting to talk about things that are heritable MH right you're not talking about marks on DNA you're talking about the structure of the DNA right itself and that is its own separate issue now I think I I want to be really careful about this because what is now I think fairly well established is that you can transfer things epigenetically over a single generation uh if as a result of experiences that the mother has during pregnancy so uh for example we know that during the 1918 pandemic flu uh many women were pregnant and got the flu and if you look at their children you find interesting statistical anomalies and those children for example the males wound up going into the army for World War II and of course the Army does a complete physical and the records are very good so you can go into that database and you find that uh the male children uh that were uh in utero during the winter of 1918 during the pandemic flu are on average a millimeter or two shorter you might say a millimeter or two that's nothing but in a huge statistical sample of millions of people that's enormously significant more interesting is that the incidence of schizophrenia went up about fourfold from about 1% to about 4% and even though autism wasn't a term in 1918 yet uh I don't think came along later what we now retrospectively would call autism also went up by about four-fold so there's something about mom being stressed and carrying the fetus at a particular stage that seems to impact brain development in a way that then makes that child more likely to be schizophrenic or autistic when they grow up do we know that it's stress and my recollection of this I believe this was um the late Paul sternberg's work as well uh I maybe have that name um incorrect but in any event that it is um if pregnant mom gets the flu in the first trimester you see this higher incidence of schizophrenia and autistic Offspring um and but do we know that it's stress per se because it's stressful to have the flu but the flu is a bunch of other things could be fever could be um uh some breakdown in the immune barrier I just want to open up the the number of variables that this could be or do we know that it's something in the hypothalamic pituitary so-called stress axis that is adrenals um so hypothalamic pituitary adrenal AIS um like is it elevated cortisol um or could it literally be an immune neural interaction of some other sort it's probably the last thing you mentioned an immune neural interaction and the reason I say that is that uh Gloria Choy at MIT uh uh uh together with her collaborators has made a mouse model of this phenomena so she takes pregnant female mice and she injects them with something that that it's she doesn't actually in infect them with virus she puts a chemical in that is on the coat of viruses that mimics viral infection and uh then what happens is that in a way that interestingly is an interaction with the with the bacterial content of her of her gut produces a surge of a immune signaling molecule called interlan 17 interlan 17 can pass through the placenta into the fetus and if it's present just as you said at a particular point in development do doesn't work anywhere during pregnancy but during something that is sort of the mouse equivalent of the first trimester if that occurs it causes disordered development of the layers of the cortex instead of it looking like layers of a cake you see balls and clumps of cells and parenthetically in some but not all post morm tissue from autistic people you can also see those balls and clumps of cells are those balls and clumps of cells thought to reflect um alterations in cell migration they are yeah some some I don't know if it's entirely known how much of it a cell division or migration but certainly migration is a part of it and it's very likely that that critical moment uh to disrupt this ordering of the brain and produce these inre es in schizophrenia or or uh autism vulnerability uh are coming at a point where neurons are migrating uh during development and uh so what choice group did is they did all the things you would want to do as a biologist so they gave things to block the function of of this interlan signaling molecule and it blocked the phenomenon they artificially injected the signaling molecule into fetal brain when the mom hadn't been stressed and they could they could reproduce it so I'm not saying that there aren't effects of stress hormones from the hypothalamic pituitary axis that are important that you mentioned but in this mouse model system work uh it seems that uh you can produce it through this immune signaling pathway and and so then the question is well like are these mice autistic well how do you know if a mouse is autistic and and the answer is it's actually a little vague right there are behaviors that neuroscientists say are analogous of human autism and one of them is If You Give a Mouse a marble in its home cage it will bury it over and over again compulsively or bury many marbles and people say that that is somehow analogous to some of the compulsive behaviors you see in autism it's a bit of a stretch right I mean it's a challenge to interpret mouse behavior in in human terms but um it's a reasonable First Step incredible and uh I hope more will continue to be done um as it surrounds the uh first trimester influenza hypothesis because it it's been around a while and um and obviously uh there's a spectrum uh of what we call autism Asbergers and U nowadays people refer to it as sometimes is neuroatypical there's some high functioning people with Autism there's some low functioning people with Autism and for that matter there's some high functioning and low functioning people who don't have autism so um but it is something that I think uh demands our attention and and it that hopefully will be resolved at some point because also influenza is uh but one immune uh insult um and presumably pregnant women are being bombarded with all sorts of uh viruses and bacteria and fungal infections and fighting them off or not fighting them off and who knows what the variation in uh neuro immune interactions exist in there uh that give rise to you know good variation and let's call it um you know uh debilitating variation well that's that's absolutely right and so for one example is that uh we don't know what the effects are on the children who were in utero while their mothers were fighting off covid right we won't know for uh for a while or the calm and cold and there might I mean there might be nothing but or there might be something serious uh lurking there like there was for pandemic flu uh and it'll be very interesting and uh and important to find out agreed I'd love to talk with you about mindbody but before we do that I would be totally remiss if I didn't ask for your um broad top Contour understanding of the mini brain the cerebellum right the so-called mini brain and here's why I've been a practicing neuroscientist for you know close to three decades I know where the cerebellum is I've dissected a bunch of them I um I could tell you where a few things are in there and I certainly have read about what the cerebellum does but whenever I do a PubMed search on cerebellum I see an ever expanding set of things that the cerebellum is implicated in not just balance as most people hear but also timing also cognition I hear about timing in particular of motor Behavior but then I also hear that it's involved in learning and not just motor learning and it certainly is involved in motor learning perhaps that little mini brain is uh doing 50 or a thousand different things but how should we think about the cerebellum what is it doing and what are some of its core operations that inform both what it's doing and perhaps what other areas of the brain are doing as well because I can point to the retinas or to auditory cortex or to the thalamus and yes there's some mysterious nuclei in the brain but to me the cerebellum is one of the most cryptic and um complicated structures to Jan and I know you spent some time in there so what's the cerebellum do well uh cerebella researchers like to joke that the cerebellum is a counterweight to keep your head from falling forward oh perfect well with all the texting nowadays people need bigger cerebellum that's right that's right probably over many generations then that will happen along with a expansion of the thumbs uh so uh but of course everybody's going to text with their mind in about another 10 years right you'll have elon's implant and you won't need your thumbs at all yeah or maybe just or my friend Eddie Chang who's a neurosurgeon and uh works on the auditory system he's been on this podcast before he was saying that if you in theory and actually in practice you could just record the neural output to the muscles of the speech system essentially and you could just amplify that and you could text without actually speaking um in fact when we read he told me uh we are actually receiving the signals as if we were going to speak the words we're reading but they don't quite arrive at the place where you could get a full-blown postseptic potential so you're not actually moving the vocal Machinery um so that means the motor signals are getting sent out there and so you're speaking what you are reading but you just don't know it that's right and it's very analogous to what happens during the rim phase of sleep right when you have commands your brain is issuing commands to your muscles to to do things uh like behave in your dreams to to run away or go here or go there uh but those signals actually are blocked in the brain stem prevented from from reaching your muscles because the uh nerves that don't go through your brain stem like the ones that control your eye movements aren't subject to that blockade that's why you can produce the rapid eye movements in in RM sleep but yeah this is a general theme in the brain a lot of times you have the output but then you shut it down and there are Rim sleep behavior disorders where people thrash and move in their sleep uh during during REM and uh it's because this outflow that's normally blocked isn't isn't blocked have you ever had the reverse happen uh I have where you wake up and you're still in so-called remonia you're still paralyzed yes and there's that Split Second that feels like eternity where you are wide awake and you cannot move and I'll tell you it's terrifying yeah sleep paralysis and actually you know it's been known uh forever you can actually find ancient Greek depictions of people lying with a demon on their chest paralyzing them and that is actually from sleep paralysis later Hogarth uh did a drawing uh of exactly that uh so yeah this is a well-known phenomenon but to get back to the cerebellum uh as we started um so the cerebellum is as you said definitely involved in motor coordination so people who have damage to the cerebellum aren't paralyzed but they tend to be clumsy uh they tend to not coordinate their movements they have a disturbed gate if they're reaching for an object they often overshoot it and have to make successive approximating motions to get back uh to their target so so that's well understood but if you look through Evolution the cerebellum is connected to this brain region called the thalamus and it's connected from there to many regions including the frontal cortex where phenomena like uh like planning and uh decision making and uh moral sense and many aspects of Personality seem to be encoded so then the question becomes well that's very far away from being clumsy what are these connections doing and as time has gone on I've been in this business from over 40 years now I'm an old guy and so initially we said oh yeah cerebellum movement control motor coordination that's what it's for as time goes on as you correctly said the cerebellum has been implicated in more and more functions many of which are far removed from the motor system and and if we're looking for a theme about what the cerebellum does is that it is there to predict the immediate future it's trying to determine what's going to happen in the next second or two to best guide behavior and as you can imagine this kind of General computation could be applied very well you can see why it's important for you know motor systems and doing sports and you know if you're trying to hit a baseball and looking at what the pitcher is doing and trying to anticipate what the pitch is but it also comes up in a social realm if we're trying to read someone and predict what they are going to do is this person Friend or Foe which is one of the first things that we try to assess when meeting someone are they competent which is the second thing we try to assess uh when meeting something a lot of this depends upon predicative circuitry and uh it dep depends in part on the cerebellum and it seems to be at least partially impaired in people who sustain cerebellar damage so it seems as if interestingly the cerebellum started out for prediction related for motor control and through Evolution its basic computation has been applied to other non-motor behaviors now I'm speaking in generalities and of lot of the details of this remain to be worked out and understood but I would say that is in a nutshell the modern conception of the cerebellum thank you finally somebody explains to me at a top Contour but highly informed way what the cerebellum does I couldn't be more grateful my pleasure in all aspects of biology and life the term nature versus nurture is relevant but never so much as when thinking about the nervous system and I know this firsthand because I've studied neural development both the nature side the so-called hardwired stuff that genes just set up neurons wire up to that neuron Etc the cerebellums in the back the eyes are in the front the hardwired stuff uh and then the softwired stuff the nurture stuff is the stuff that can be modified by experience what are your thoughts on nature versus nurture and should there even be a versus in there yeah I don't think there should and and I have a lot of problems with nature versus nurture as a as an expression it was popularized by Francis gton uh in the 19th century a a colleague of uh of uh of darwins and I think it's wrong in or misleading in a lot of ways so of course the nature in nature versus nurture is meant in this case to mean heritability right what you inherit in the gene variations from your mother and father and nurture means like how your parents or your community raised you uh the problem I have with nurture is that it is too narrow a term that really it should be replaced with the word experience and experience in the broadest possible sense not just social experience but uh the foods your mother ate when she was carrying you in utero um the diseases you fought off or your mother fought off while she was carrying you uh in utero the bacterial population of your gut uh so experience meaning anything that impinges on you starting from the earliest stages of fetal developments uh continuing to the last day of your life I think it should be very expansive much much more than social experience in the family or the or the community and as you mentioned I have a problem with versus because there's this idea that these things are are essentially in opposition well is he that way because of of of his Gene variance or is that way because of what what happened to him and I think the thing to realize is that uh experience and heredity interact in all kinds of interesting ways some of which are oppositional and some of which are reinforcing a classic one from genetics has to do with a genetic disease called phenol ketonuria or PKU uh which is uh an inability to uh to metabolize uh the dietary amino acid phenyalanine and uh so uh in order to have this you have to inherit broken copies of this Gene from both your mother and your father so it's a so-called recessive trait and here's where the experience comes in it only matters if you eat foods rich and fenal alanine if you don't it doesn't matter that you inherited these things right so that's a way which genes and experience interact an idea of in ways in which then they interact positively um think about athletic ability right so a lot of athletic ability is has a heritable component if you are born fast for example uh then you're more likely to do Sports and practice them and get better Sports as a result of your experience so here genes and experience are feeding back on each other in a positive feedback loop so there really isn't uh a vers a versus at all and then of course the last thing is that this isn't the entirety so we talked earlier about the pseudo random nature of development stochastic development and so if I were to take the phrase nature versus nurture and reconfigure it I would change it to read heritability interacting with experience filtered through the random nature of development now that doesn't fall off the tongue as elegantly as nature versus nurture you know nature versus nurture is like if the glves the gloves don't fit you must quit you know it's got that kind of Snappy snare drum beat but I think it's it's a accurate so heritability interacting with experience filtered through the randomness of development yeah so we can shorten that up and um and we'll just call it um uh the Linden hypothesis you know I don't think I can take credit for that that's it belongs to other people sure but um but there's a long history in science of of things being U shortened up and uh coined and that's uh as important and I'm not we're not trying to rob attribution here um uh and the good news is perhaps you can't call it the lyen hypothesis but I can all right and what I found is as with the Galpin equation which is now out there as a hydration it's a formula a formula that uh gives broad but um research and formed parameters as to how much water one should drink in order to maintain proper hydration for physiologist Dr Andy Galpin who's a PhD in uh physiology and and an expert in all aspects of exercise science there's the Galpin equation there's the soberg principle so I'm naming these things left and right right um where appropriate and um so I'm naming these things uh sparingly and where appropriate um so from here on out heritability interacting with experience filtered through the randomness of development is the lynen hypothesis and I'll be damned if anyone's going to rename it uh um faster that I'm going to propagate it so all right well I think all the the the geneticists will be nashing their teeth uh about this being named after someone who isn't actually a geneticist quite all right and their dentists will thank me let's talk about mindbody okay I'm am fascinated by this um for a couple of reasons and I promise to keep this brief but when I was growing up I was very interested in animals and biology and my father's a scientist and I got very interested in Neuroscience early um as people perhaps know and so much of Neuroscience as I was coming up through the mid90s 2000s 2010 to 20 stretch was focused on the brain piece MH very little on the body there was nothing about gut brain AIS in the early discussions and cours work um in parallel to all of that I've been interested in mental health physical health and let's just call it performance and um got interested in meditation respiration based practices things like Yoga Nidra things that by way of experience I understood immediately had a profound influence on the nervous system states of Mind and Body nowadays there's an entire Institute at the National Institutes of Health for complimentary health and Medicine essentially exploring things like yoganidra respiration practices even supplements and things of that sort and there's this understanding that oh my goodness the nervous system extends into the body and the body sends neural signals back into the brain and so this whole notion of Mind Body has fortunately migrated away from kind of um California counterculture esselin Institute only uh you know um hippie New Age Magic Carpet stuff by the way that's not what I believe that's but that's often how it was looked at in the past and now people at every level of science and medicine and every major university and in every scientific journal are starting to publish papers about the interactions between bodily organs like the breathing apparati the diaphragm lungs the heart heart rate variability we hear about um the liver the gut brain axis in particular and so Mind Body the idea that our thoughts could influence our body and that our bodily State could influence our thoughts is fortunately not just understood but it seems to be both accepted and appreciated so what are your thoughts on mindbody what ises that mean to you and what do you think is the potential of the mindbody interaction it seems to me we've just barely scratch the surface yeah well I'm glad you asked because I think it's a it's a really fascinating uh situation and uh where things are changing very very quickly and I think to me the most important thing for people to understand is that when you have a hypothesis let's say you have a hypothesis that uh meditation can uh attenuate chronic pain all right well there is a temptation to think that this operates outside the realm of Science and biology that is in some arery realm in the clouds that this happens and and and I mean for for good reason there are a lot of people who will describe it in exactly that way with auras or they they Co-op scientific terms like resonance and energy but they don't actually use them in scientific way so you know there's a lot of very fuzzy language that surrounds this but it shouldn't obscure the fact that when you have a hypothesis that say some mental State like meditation or or or guided breathing uh uh affects some process in the body that you should be trying to understand this in terms of a biological hypothesis not in terms of some some some indistinct realm that that is that is different like manifestation yeah and you know I really learned this in initially from my father my father was a psychiatrist in fact kind of a talking cure old-fashioned psychoanalyst had his practice in uh Los Angeles and uh we would have dinner together every Wednesday night and uh he would always tell me about his patience he was very careful to keep confidentiality right he wouldn't great confidentiality but you know I would say oh yes how's your narcissist oh we had this dream so was you know this was this was normal conversation when I was 14 15 years old with my dad and one day I said Dad it's really clear to me that through this talking cure a large fraction of your patients feel better and they conquer their depression or or or their obsessive thoughts or things that are blocking them how do you think it works and he says well we don't really know the mechanics But ultimately when it works it's not working in some araer realm it is was working by changing the biology of the brain and when he said that it was like a lightning bolt went off in my head and I thought well I don't have the kind of personality to be a talking cure psychiatrist I'm not nearly nice enough but I could understand the underlying biology maybe I'll do that uh and so as you've correctly pointed out when you say the phrase Mind Body you're talking about two directions you're talking about mental functions affecting the body and then you were also talking about how phenomena in the body affect affect the mind and we're understanding so much more about how that happens and I think the general thing for your your listeners to appreciate is that we have some culprits here right and generally speaking there are there are two classes of culprits so if you want to get signals about the body to the mind there's two ways to do that one of them is through neurons that reach out into the body and sense things and this is referred to as Inception right so as opposed to extra reception your your outward pointing senses these are the senses that monitor or your own body and and while we can consciously be aware of a lot of that information a lot of it is happening subconsciously like your breathing is happening automatically most of the time without you thinking about it and that depends upon sensors about your blood chemistry and the state of your lungs and a number of other things that are regulating that process and it's all happening in the brain usually below the level of your conscious attention in addition to the neural signals there is also a whole realm of hormonal or diffusible immune signals and what these are is that these are chemicals that are released into the bloodstream and that move throughout the body and that can uh uh activate neurons in the brain or in other parts of the nervous system to produce changes in uh in mental in mental function and I think the real thing that is exciting a lot of people right now has to do with immune signaling molecules so there's a class of molecules called cyto kindes and cyto kindes are basically the signaling hormones of the immune system and they they can flow through the bloodstream and through lymphatic fluid uh and reach many parts of the body uh we've known for a number of years that the specialized receptors for these cyto kindes are found throughout the brain and yet we know very very very little about about what they do and that's going to be an astonishingly fruitful area of scientific research but but to give one one Exemplar um there are a lot of things these days suggesting a a a link between inflammation in the body whether it be in the gut or in other places to depression well how might that work well it could work either through inflammation sensing neurons sending electrical signals to the brain or and it's not either or it could be both it could be immune signaling cyto molecules produced at the site of inflammation that then travel through the bloodstream and the lymphatic system to then reach the brain bind ctors and have effects and so you know one of the mysteries about depression is that uh it's not that tractable to pharmacological therapy so if you look at people who suffer with depression about a third of people see significant benefit from Modern SSRI and related anti-depressant drugs uh about a third C very tiny benefit and about a third SE no benefit at all and part of the reason is because maybe our term depression is too big a bucket depression is actually many different biological disorders and only a subset of those are are helped by ssris and we'll need different therapies for the other ones that's certainly part of it um but part of it might actually have to do with inflammation so if you think that inflammation is a a risk factor in depression well you could do something very simple right you could you could gobble an ibuprofen right there's a whole bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs that are very well understood and so well what if you just say all right you know uh let's have a study where we have a bunch of depressed people and we have them all eat anti-inflammatory drugs for a few weeks and we see if this relieves their depression and the answer seems to be no it doesn't well and that's that's a little bit hard to understand because there are definitely links between inflammation and depression so for example one of the early treatments for uh for Hepatitis C that's since been superseded by more modern drugs was a pro-inflammatory cyto molecule and when you gave it to people to treat their hepatitis C almost everyone became depressed on this drug so oh well this really seems like like like a link likewise there are certain uh neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis it turns out the incidence of depression as a comorbidity in multiple sclerosis is enormous and you might think well there's a trivial reason for that if you're paralyzed from Ms you're bummed out about life and that's the reason but if you look at people who have spinal cord injuries from accidents they actually have major depression at a at a at a rate from people who are uninjured so that doesn't seem to be it it's not just that you're bummed out from being paralyzed although of course it's reasonable to be bummed out about being paralyzed but that's not it so what happens in Ms well there's a bunch of cyto kindes including one called Incan 6 I6 that's elevated massively if you if you take a spinal tap and you look at cerebral spinal fluid and so that could be causitive for depression so all these real reasons to think that inflamation is involved but yet the idea is still a bit messy so now what if instead of looking of the general population of depressed people you look at the subset of people that don't respond to SSRI anti-depressants are they helped by anti-inflammatories and there there's a bit of a hint that maybe they are it's not definitive yet there are a couple of studies it's it's it's right on the edge but I think this is a really good example of how we are going to see progress very soon soon in the body to mind part of Mind Body medicine that is going to be of enormous uh benefit to people so interesting could I get your thoughts on one candidate hypothesis that I've been thinking about I've covered depression on a few episodes and um I've had Robin cardart Harris um from UCSF and Dr Matthew Johnson from your very own John Hopkins University both of whom work run Laboratories studying psychedelics for the treatment of depression um the clinical trials on Sil cybin um and to be clear cybin still illegal it's been decriminalized a few places but we're not talking about recreational use we're talking about several therapy sessions and then two without psilocybin then two um 2.5 gram approximately dosages of psilocybin given separately again with therapist present and then follow-up therapy sessions seem to lead to relief of depression in approximately somewhere between 65 and 80% of people um in some cases total remission in some cases um some relief without remission okay so we can kind of set that result on the Shelf it's been repeated a number of different times compare that to the results of ssris which seem to help a third of people a third minimally and a third not at all and of course there's the side effect profiles of the ssris and Associated drugs not just the ssris but gryon and the other anti-press uh that are taken in prescription drug form and then there's this uh inflammation piece so could we hypothesize that relief from depression has something to do with neuroplasticity rewiring of neural circuits and that psilocybin we know can encourage neuroplasticity and that perhaps ssris can encourage neuroplasticity in some people not all and that inflammation is a barrier to neuroplasticity um to me this is the only thing that can reconcile the the current status of the of the results and then there's ketamine based therapies and so we have to also kind of set that on the Shelf but let's set that aside on the shelf for now to keep it simple um it seems to me that based on the time course over which ssris work the fact that they increase serotonin uh very quickly but the relief from depression comes much later the fact that neuromodulators like serotonin are intimately involved in neuroplasticity they can some cases gate neuroplasticity that it all centers back to changing neural circuits and so what we're really trying to do whether or not it's transrenal magnetic stimulation or now we can throw ketamine in there or psilocybin or ssris we're that treating depression is about rewiring the brain it's not about chemical A or B per se although serotonin seems involved to me what I'd love to see is are more studies about the interaction between neuroplasticity and inflammation and are we seeing that kind of work out there and um because these results sort of sit as disperate somewhat conflicting but it seems like inflammation is is anti- neuroplasticity and broadly speaking here I realize there are many inter lucans there are many you know some of which are inflammatory some of which are anti-inflammatory but is that is that a meaningful hypothesis and it um can do you think there's any hope whatsoever to actually cure depression if we if we sort of start to uh unify the the the results in these different camps yeah I think it's a completely reasonable hypothesis and I would be broader and I would say honestly the relief of any neuros psychiatric condition ultimately is from neuroplasticity in some form or another and I think it's worthwhile to step back a bit and talk about what neuroplasticity means uh to date there has been a focus on synapses on the contacts between neurons as the site of neuroplastic and that's warranted synapses are plastic they change as a result of experience as a result of hormone changes as a result of exercise as a result of lots of things but synapses are not the Beall and end all of neural function so for example neurons work by sending electrical signals uh uh along their lengths and and between neurons and interconverting those with chemical signals and the processes of generating those electrical signals the ion channels that are involved that are embedded in membranes that are involved in that are also plastic they can also change as a result of experience that's what we call intrinsic plasticity as opposed to synaptic plasticity in addition there are literal morphological changes so when we talk about the wiring of the brain sometimes we're talking about literal wiring like C A wasn't connected to cell b and now it is and that changes and then sometimes well actually cell a was connected to cell b but cell b wasn't responsive enough and now there's a change in cell b so now cell a can fire cell b and that could have been a result of a change in its synapse making it more receptive to neurotransmitter released from cell a or it could be something intrinsic in cell a that makes it fire its electrical signal it Spike more easily I think that one of the key cell types that's going to be important for your hypothesis um linking inflammation to synaptic plasticity is going to be a cell called a micral cell and micral cells are non neuronal cells in the brain they're motile they can crawl around they have long processes and they can gobble things up they can literally sort of chew away way and digest bits of the extracellular scaffolding that surrounds neurons and synapses and thereby renders them plastic they can uh destroy synapses and there is a lot of indication that certain disease States may involve over exuberant microa pruning synapses to a degree that they shouldn't and we know that microa are chock full of cyto kind receptors and so are responsive to inflammatory signals when we're talking about inflammation and we're talking about drugs it's worthwhile to mention that there are a lot of Behavioral things that also can influence the signaling so we know and I know you've discussed on your program the incredibly salubrious effects of physical exercise on mental function so exercise is about as good anti-depressant as ssris are and the side effects are only good side effects as opposed to the bad side effects of ssris and again this isn't working through some Ayer realm the reason that Exercise Works to relieve depression and the reason that Exercise Works to maintain your cognitive function as you age is because of biological Pathways that we are now uncovering some of which will involve micral cells and neurons and other types of cells in the brains some of which will involve not the neurons in the brain at all but the brain's vasculature so we know that exercise is very salubrious for keeping blood flowing to the brain and when you're young you have a super abundance of blood flowing to your brain so it doesn't matter if it's reduced transiently you're fine but as you get older uh your blood vessels become more uded and less elastic and you're closer to the to the to the trouble spot uh and if you exercise regularly you can dilate and make your blood vessels including those in your brain more elastic and that is almost certainly protective against both depression and cognitive decline uh as we age I am a fan of exercise but I'm fortunate that I enjoy running and some forms of resistance training um so I always assumed that the good side effects were just the positive mood effects um until the recent literature that as you mentioned uh improved vascular vasculature blood flow and reduced inflammation if not during the exercise when inflammation actually increases um decreases inflammation um I'm delighted to hear you say the word microa and um my postto adviser the late Ben Baris would be especially delighted people can look up Ben I'll provide a link to his um uh biography in the show note captions because he really championed um to the point of of um I don't know if Champions even a sufficient word I mean Ben was beating the drum saying we have to pay attention to Gia we have to pay attention to Gia for the longest time gleo were relegated to these other journals they even had their own journals and in the last what is it 10 years there's been a kind of explosion of research exploring the role of microa and other gal cell types and it's it's really f fantastic to see that uh this actually the most abundant cell type in the brain is the the gal cell um are getting the attention they deserve it's absolutely true uh and uh you know we scientists like to think that we're very rational creatures and we're not subject to fads but we totally are right when I started out in this field um in the early 80s everything was about opioid peptides and then there was a period where gaseous neurotransmitters like nitric oxide were all the rage and you know right now glea are in the spotlight for good reason I'm not trying to say that that it isn't worthwhile but there is this phenomenon of things being fattish and people jumping on bandwagons and it happens both in terms of the subject we study but also in terms of the techniques we use and right now the technique that is most most fattish involves um single cell expression profiling that is creating a list of what genes are turned on and how strong they're turned on in single cells and seeing how that changes in different cell types and with experience and it's a very it's a very valuable technique but one could argue that it is perhaps a bit overused and that 15 years from now people will go back and say gosh those folks in 2023 we're really overdoing it with the Single Cell profiling yeah and if anyone's thinking about getting into the field of Neuroscience or another area of biological or other research I can just tell you that if you're starting your PhD or your postto take a look at whatever fat is happening now and just know that in five years it will be something different and it takes you about five years to finish your PhD or postto so pick something different than what's fattish now and you'll you'll land right on the money that there's always a lot to do you don't have to do what everyone else is doing and indeed uh the deletion test becomes relevant here um the deletion test as it was described to me by my colleague EJ Chichi at Stanford is um if you look around and you see um one or more groups um doing what you want to do very well just pick something else your life's going to be a lot more pleasant um absolutely I agree with uh with EJ on that uh entirely let's get back to mindbody um there are a bunch of different domains of mindbody as you um so apply pointed out it's bidirectional mind informs the body body informs the mind um but we could probably break this down into uh respiration so breathing um conscious patterns of breathing um emphasizing inhales or emphasizing exhales cyclic hyperventilating Etc could also be thought patterns um a little bit harder to break those down but um many not all but many forms of meditation involve having a very still body not all there's walking meditation Etc but still body um focused mind kind of a not a state that we are in a lot of times unless we direct that state um there are still other mindbody patterns of communication through very still body deep relaxation things like Yoga Nidra non-sleep deep rest um there's hypnosis there's um uh touchbased Body Mind communication if we're going to talk about Mind Body also we should refer to as body mind um how do we dive in and think about this because this is involving clearly a thousand different neural Pathways not just the Vegas nerve as it's you know typically people just kind of hang their hat on Mind Body must be Vegas nerve and of course it involves the Vegas but the Vegas is an extensive set of Pathways so um how do you like to frame up mind body and what's most intriguing to you about mindbody communication both in terms of the biology and its practical app well I think just as we talked about how there are two potential Pathways in conveying signals from the body to the mind there are also two potential Pathways at least two potential Pathways to conveying signals from the brain to the body uh and they are the the the neural signals that are conveyed by neurons that actually get there and they are uh hormones and neurotransmitters and cyto kindes that are released from the brain I should mention that that hormones are actually produced by neurons including for example some of the hormones that you think about uh as being produced as as sex hormones like estrogen is produced by neurons in your brain for example um so let me give an example that I think is a bit out there but I think is really really fascinating and this comes from uh from the cancer world and so uh melanoma is a is a is a bad cancer it kills a lot of people it can spread it's uh highly metastatic and we know that melanomas often become inovated that is to say they become contacted by neurons and wrapped and receive signals from them and we also know that if a melanoma becomes inated then the prognos is for that patient is worse it's more likely to grow it's more likely to spread well how does that happen well recently uh there have been some reports that uh show that neurons that innervate the melanoma don't act directly onto the tumor cells rather what they do is they secrete a signaling molecule that has a receptor on immune cells that are patrolling the edges of the melanoma tumor and nibbling away at it and they when that signaling molecule is released from the neuron it uh shuts down or reduces that immune patrolling function and then as a consequence the tumor can grow and spread and butt off more readily so this signal that comes from neurons is sending the ambulances home so to speak yeah exactly and and the signal is something called calcitonin Gene related peptide or cgrp uh I'm familiar with cgrp from the domain of touch and its involvement in um I think like itch perception do I pain perception and itch perception right interesting yeah and so all right so if neurons can um can affect the progression of cancer through their activity and these neurons in the periphery are ultimately connected to the brain through a couple of different hops um then is it reasonable to hypothesize that mental processes could affect cancer progression so let's say we hypothesis and it's a wild hypothesis and I want to just emphasize that there is not evidence for this but let's make the hypothesis that says that through meditative practice you can slow the progression of certain tumors that tend to get interated right well right now this is just kind of a wild idea but I think the important thing as I've said before that this is a wild idea with a biological substrate it's not like you meditate and Magic happens and force fields open and the Angels Sing and then your tumor shrinks this is we are saying that activity in certain areas of the brain is increased by this meditative practice and that this send signals to this neuron and this neuron that actually go to the tumor and make something happen through this biochemical pathway that we have defined right and to me this is speculative but it's also extraordinarily exciting right it opens a kind of Investigation of mind to body signaling that has received very little attention up to now incredible and I say incredible because while you're giving an example of cgrp and nerve inovation and metastatic uh tumors I absolutely love the idea that a phenomenon involving some practice that could be put under the umbrella of Mind Body or body mind um becomes something en entirely different when we're trying to hang that on the hook of a biological process it's like something fundamentally changes there right um you know it's amazing to me for instance that early on psychedelics and breath work conscious breath work uh were lumped together cost people their jobs at major universities I won't name the universities because we're all you work at one I work at another and there's a third one um called Harvard I guess I just Nam them um but nowadays there are Laboratories at every single one of those institutions studying deliberate respiration on health as well as psychedelics um and meditation for that matter um with the goal of understanding what cyto kindes what neurotransmitters Etc change through defined Pathways including Vegas but frenic nerves and uh frontal cortex and all the stuff that is considered you know classic rigorous Neuroscience so I do think we we've entered a new era um so it's not cting people their jobs anymore it's actually giving people their jobs and it's federally funded which itself is also fantastic in my opinion so we are in a new era what do you think um needs to be done to really nail down the idea that how we think influences our biology even though it's a total duh because everyone knows that chronic stress for instance is can be detrimental short-term stress can actually be beneficial but um and stress is a mental process that essentially deploys chemicals in the body that then create other issues in the body that then create shifts in mental processes you know it's so it's so obvious when it's spelled out but it's just remarkable to me how this has just been lumped in the category of like woo science um and I can't quite figure out what needs to be done in order to convince people that their nervous system includes stuff outside the skull and spinal cord and of course of course of course it would work this way well right and I I think it is the job of biomedic researchers right now to reclaim a lot of this from from the realm of nonsense and the problem is there has been a lot of nonsense and you know there's there's sort of a visal reaction you when when someone says oh yeah well you can do me breath work and it'll realign your chakras and that is you know what will uh uh reduce your anxiety or your gut inflammation and I'm tempted to just go oh shut up but what if the chakras are collections of nerve ination of bodily sphincters and you know it could make sense right it could but it's got to there's got to be some some biology in some cases these analogies are rooted in something real and in some cases they're just made up right and I think the challenge is to have really rigorous scientific tests of these things to take it back and to be willing to say all right there have been a lot of claims for example made about how mental processes can influence the body and only a subset of those are going to be true and of that subset it is our job to understand how they work both to rationalize them but also to to optimize them and and make them better I mean there's no question that mental processes affect the body I mean we know for example that if we just keep you awake and don't let you sleep long enough you'll die and what will you die from you'll die from sepsis because the the barrier between your gut contents uh and and your perineum will will will will break down right well so how does that happen right we're just starting to understand like there's a really dramatic example but there are going to be many more subtle examples so you you've mentioned breath work a couple of times and I think this is really interesting um my colleagues who are interested in respiration tell me that you can record in many different places in the brain many different places in the neocortex and other regions and find a signature of the breathing Rhythm sort of as a background uh to neural activity you can find it in the cerebellum you can find it in the frontal cortex you can find it in uh the habenula which is implicated in many things including depression you can find it lots of places so the idea that conscious modulation of your breathing could have manifold effects on neural function I think is reasonable given that kind of observation here here let's talk about you a bit uh more uh you've been so gracious in covering this wide array of topics and with uh such eloquence and uh I must say I've been delighting in all of it you are in a unique position these days because uh if I understand correctly uh you've been diagnosed with a fatal illness um I suppose we've all been diagnosed with a fatal illness of sorts because um we're all going to die sooner or later yes um if you're willing could you tell us the story of how that diagnosis came to be what your initial reaction was and where things stand now and and perhaps we can explore some of the well let's just say pleasant surprises that have emerged um since that initial diagnosis well sure I'd be happy to uh so in the uh the uh summer of 2020 uh in the dark days of covid when things were looking really bad I developed profound shortness of breath I couldn't get up a flight of stairs without uh uh without huffing and puffing and I thought oh well I've got Co but I took covid tests and there was they they they were all negative but I thought oh I must have covid I've got the symptoms of covid I have respiratory issues I'm feeling weak it's got to be covid and after a while when this didn't go away my wife said look you got to go into the doctor this is crazy it's you got to find out what's going on and I did and they uh they hooked me up to an electrocardiogram and they said oh uh you've got atrial fibrillation meaning that your heart is doing two beats every time it should do one so I have a very high heart rate and when the heart beats that fast it can't work very effectively there is enough time to recharge before the next beat comes now it turns out that there is a very straightforward therapy for this uh atrial fibrillation comes from uh electrical signaling in the heart sort of swirling about in a circle and and reactivating part of the heart muscle faster than it should and so if you thread through a catheter in your in your in your in your groin up uh up through blood vessels you can put in a little needle and use that to quize and to ablate a tiny little strip of cells in the heart that will produce a barrier that will prevent that aarant return of electrical activity and will cure atrial fibrillation so I had that process that ablation surgery and sure enough it it cured my atrial fibrillation and I was feeling terrific and they said oh as a followup come back uh a few months later and we'll do an echo cardiogram to see how your heart looks and they did and they went oh my God there's this huge mass pressing against your heart it's like the size of a Coke can uh here's what we think it is we think it's a hadal hernia we think your stomach has poked up through the diaphragm muscle and it's nestling next to your heart so the way we diagnose this it's kind of humorous they say chug this can of diet Dr Pepper and then quickly get up on the table and we'll do the echocardiogram and in the echocardiogram we can see a signature of the popping CO2 bubbles in your soda and if we see those in the mass then we know it's your stomach so I did it I chugged it I got up there oh nope it's not your stomach I said oh okay well what we think this is is a Teratoma and a Teratoma is a developmental uh anomaly that you carry usually from fetal life where there's a group of different cells that gets in a place where it shouldn't during development and then grows you've probably heard about people who sometimes get like a a tooth that grows hair in their abdomen Sometimes women have these around their ovaries and they're not malignant they don't spread it's a fairly easy thing but I have this enormous Coke can pressing on my heart it may have we don't know have been the source of my atrial fibrillation to start with but in order to deal with this I had to have open heart surgery so I had the surgery and it was a big hairy deal I was told it would last about five hours it turns out it lasted two days wow um they had me on the heart lung bypass machine longer than you're supposed to because you're very likely to throw a clot and get a stroke fortunately that didn't happen I had very skilled surgeons at John's Hopkins it was bleeding so much that they couldn't close the chest so they had to do all the surgery and then just leave me anesthetized with my chest open until the bleeding stop and they so the surgery was a be and then uh I'm waiting to get the pathology report back on the tissue they removed and it came back and it was bad news sorry it's not a Teratoma it's not benign it is a kind of cancer called sovial saroma and sovial saroma is a moderately rare cancer and it usually affects the synovium which is the lining of the joints or some other places it's pretty rare to have it happen in the heart there are a few examples if you look in the biomedical literature for common cancers like Tes testicular cancer or breast cancer there are huge tables of Statistics from millions of patients on what's been tried and what works and what the prognosis is for sovial saroma of the heart they're only individual case reports oh there's a guy in Kenya and he got it and this is what happened there's there's there there's there's a woman in Minnesota and this is what happened with her right there are no statistics because because it's that rare and and and the oncologist said well I think you've got 6 to 18 months to live now this was uh about uh now 27 months ago so I've fortunately uh exceeded that lifespan estimate and I think we got to be clear also that you know being an oncologist has got to be a terrible job for many reasons but one of them is that you got to give a lifespan estimate even if you really don't have the data to do it in a very inform you can't just say I won't do it right you got to do it people expect it so you know I'm not saying like oh the oncologist was incompetent because I've outlived my estimate you know he was trying to do something based on very little information made his best guess so um so so you know I got this information and I was Furious I was so angry heart cancer who the hell gets heart cancer is that even a thing have you ever heard of somebody with heart cancer not until now no heart cancer what the f I've got heart cancer this is this is crazy time I was 59 years old I I got a lot to do I can't have heart cancer and what was I think transformative for me is that at the same time that I was feeling white hot angry with the Universe I was also feeling a deep sense of gratitude for what I've had I've had a terrific life I'm not that young I've had a lot of it and I had great parents wonderful friends growing up I've had a good career uh it's been a fairly easy run of it um and I think the ability to have a job where you follow your own curiosity every day there's nothing like that so few people in the world get to live that way I feel incredibly grateful and I feel incredibly grateful my family and I have a wonderful wife named Dena and she's just the best how do I deserve this I don't deserve her you know honestly um so you know in Neuroscience we often think oh well there's a you know you have a state you have a set point are you anxious or are are you relaxed are you fleeing or are you approaching you know it's it's like a single axis well but it isn't you know and I think most people understand that but but dumb me I I I didn't until that moment really understand that I could feel profoundly grateful and profoundly angry in the very in the very same moment and you know having cancer and getting the kind of treatments the chemo the radiation you know it's famously deeply unpleasant and I had all that and it was just as unpleasant as anyone's cancer story that that that you've heard the radiation burned my esophagus I couldn't eat for weeks it was months it was painful to swallow you know bad stuff lots of people have have had to have bad stuff like this and and what I it realize you know this is It's a deeply um unempowered situation to be a medical patient particularly when there's something serious you have you have a limited sense of agency things are being done to you drugs go in you that make you feel really bad and there isn't there isn't that much to do and I realized that for me the sense of agency came from being curious from being a total nerd about things and part of what it made me curious about was my own mental processes as they related to my cancer and my cancer diagnosis uh so for example I'm getting the ch Mo and uh I should just say as background I'm fortunate I I don't have a tendency for depression I'm a pretty upbeat guy I don't take any credit for that I think I was just born lucky and and raised lucky right but day after day of feeling bad in your body from chemo boy it's hard to be positive it really is I could not overcome it my mood got really really low and I could tell myself this is going to be over it's not going to go on forever you won't feel this way forever and you would think that as a rational person I could talk myself out of that mood but I couldn't you know probably because there was my brain was a wash in interlan six and I couldn't overcome it I felt really low but at the same time I was sort of out of remove being a nerd about going like huh I bet these cyto kindes are messing me up right now I bet that's what's going on and that gave me some sense of agency in a Time where otherwise I really wouldn't have it another thing it really brought home to me is this issue that we were discussing earlier about how malleable perception is and perception of time in particular if someone had said to me when I was healthy before I was diagnosed you're going to die in five years I would have gone oh no no no no no no I'm 59 years old I should get way more than 5 years I got a lot of things to do uh professional things personal things family things I got all things to do no that wouldn't be right I'd be very upset but you know if you told me after my diagnosis of 6 to 18 months oh you get five years I'd be like five years yeah that's pretty good I can do a lot in five years I can finish up in the lab and I can I can do some good work and I can spend time with my family and travel and save her life's pleasures and do all kinds of things five years great and of course it's the same five years right the only thing that's different is the is the context but I think the thing that really I realize the most is that I really couldn't and still can't engage with the idea of myself being gone so yeah I can do practical things I can update my will I can write letters for my people in my lab so you know if I kick off you know they've got that to take to their next job you know I can do all these nuts and bolts things but in terms of genuinely engaging with my own demise I really find that as much as I try I really can't do that and I first I thought well that's just your own lack of imagination Lyon it's just because you know you're not very good at this but the more I thought about it I thought actually no this is a human thing this is a fundamental human thing and and one of the things when I look back on the 40 plus years I've been doing Neuroscience that's different is that when I was first trained the brain was really described as a reactive structure something happens in the world you know it comes to your sense organs your eyes your ears it goes into your brain it triggers some things you you think you make decisions and then you make an action that goes out to your muscles or or or and that's the loop and that's what the brain does and what we have known in more recent years is that actually when the brain is waiting for something to happen it's not just idling and spacing out that the brain is at every moment subconsciously trying to predict the near future predicting the near future is predicated on the idea that there will be a near future that is to say that you won't be dead and gone right that there'll be a future for you and so I think that my ability which I think is actually a human I mean not my ability my failure which I think is actually a human failure to truly engage with my own demise is a feature it is it is a side effect of the fact that the brain is always trying to predict the future and so that was interesting to me just as a way that my illness was revealing something about the brain but it also made me think a lot about the world's religions right religion is everywhere in the world if you ask anthropologists is there any society that doesn't have religious ideas both say no they said they don't always have the word religion they might just say well yeah in this place everybody knows that you know the world's on the back of a turtle and that you know this and this happened there are these rules they may not call it religion but every place in the world has religion not everyone is religious but it is across cultural Universal and most religions not absolutely every single one but almost every single one has stories of afterlife or reincarnation in which your Consciousness endures well why would that be and and and in many religions they've got a deal right follow these rules in life and then you'll be rewarded in the afterlife and that's that's a very a very general idea or punished in the afterlife or punished in the afterlife right and you know in some religions you meld with the Divine in other religions you're reincarnated is this or that heaven or hell right there's there's variance but but they share that your Consciousness endures and so why is this so popular all over the world well I would hypothesize that it is a side effect of the fact that the brain can't help but always trying to predict the future when we can't imagine the world without us in it then we are forced to concoct stories of the afterlife fascinating and makes me want to ask about this feature of time perception um my undergraduate graduate and post talk advisors all sadly died earlier early really um by pretty much any standard um and I was fortunate enough to be in communication with the the last two as they were going through that process um both of them described um a heightened sense of gratitude especially for things that previously they had not paid attention to so we call this noticing the little things yes but um that makes me conclude that something about the knowledge of one's impending death however far off that might be um shifts our attention at least temporarily leads to this sense of slowing down a bit because in order to shift our attention to quote unquote with the little things or things that we previously overlooked um there's this sense of slowing down and we know from uh basic uh videography photography that slowing down means an increase in frame rate M right that uh you know you know shooting at um strobe frame rates gives you the perception of uh strobe um shooting at very high frame rates allows you to see things in very slow motion you're noticing subtle variations that normally you overlook um I not trying to be overly reductionist about this uh this process of enhanced gratitude um that's uh that you describe and how it was alongside intense anger but have you noticed a shift in your perception of time because you were given initially this okay X number of months and then now with the you're still here fortunately um and with this kind of openend did well it wasn't the prediction that was given to you by your oncologist but it's unclear how long you're going to be here right um which is how most of us exist you have the sense that it's sooner rather than later but you don't really know so I'm curious as to how the idea that okay you have 12 months more to live versus more than 12 months but not infinite but of course I know that I've hopefully have more than 12 months but it's not infinite yes so you know this this idea of of the the Finish Line the cliff leaving aside whatever might happen afterwards I don't know haven't been there um it changes what we notice by way of changing our perception of time um I mean this is a this is a profound tuning of our perception what are your thoughts on that and and do you notice the each sip of coffee you probably don't notice each step across the kitchen floor in the morning you're probably paying attention to your lovely wife and kids and things that day but presumably um it's Dynamic but what is your perception of time like now with the understanding that yes you made it through the past the gate that was predicted but what's lies ahead is is uncertain yeah so that's really interesting and I would say definitely my perception of time is slower and it seems like an age since I was diagnosed but I think part of that is because it's been action-packed in other words since I was diagnosed so many emotionally Salient things non-trivial things have happened so many intense discussions with my wife and my friends and the people in my lab uh you know my wife and I have taken a lot more vacations than we normally do so you know we're running all over the world and there's a certain sense of of packing it in that I think influences time perception but I would say actually for me personally the Gratitude isn't about the little things the Gratitude is about the very biggest things the Gratitude is gratitude for being a sensient being and having that blessing the Gratitude is for being able to have a life where I can follow my own ideas and creativity and my gratitude is for choke up the profound love that I've felt from my wife and my children you know it's all the little stuff it's the big stuff that I think about when I think about gratitude it's not noticing the sip of tea it's it's the big issues and you know for me I you know I don't I want to delay my death as much as possible of course but uh when I think about it the part that makes me upset is leaving people behind it's not for myself I've I've had a great life um I've had a lot of it I'm 61 I'd like to go longer but that's that's a pretty good run I've gotten to do lots of things in those 61 years and and have wonderful loving interconnected experiences and so the negative part is about what I leave behind certainly what you've left behind is enormous um and has been the consequence of actions long before your diagnosis which I think is a is a clear lesson to everyone um I can't speak for you but don't wait for the diagnosis um you've mentioned the sense of agency uh that you felt um by being able to pay attention to and explore your experience of let's call it what it is impending death um and at the same time you as you mentioned you've Amplified and uh accelerated the number of things that you've put into the world recently writing incredible um articles about your experience of life and death and we will of course link to those so people can read them um I've read them all and they are uh profound and they don't just feel important they clearly are important so very few people have uh your insight into the nervous system at the mechanistic level but also at this more holistic level that um you've clearly displayed to us here and and in your research and in your book writing and public speaking um you know I think it's a it's a risky thing to ask uh somebody for advice um but I can't help myself because um I think it's a it's a real opportunity um if you had advice um to give to any and all of us um based on the whole experience yeah uh all of it from go as they say right um if if you're willing and feel free to pass but if you're willing um what is your advice well I would say the advice that is really Universal is what everybody already knows and is a bit trait but I'll say it anyway and that is appreciate what you got while you got it and you know this isn't any big secret and everyone knows it I would say for a subset of people the way of the nerd is very empowering I don't think that's the case for everyone I think for a subset of people who are deeply curious as their nature turning that Curiosity to your own mortality and your own medical situation can be empowering and and useful but I don't think that should be broad advice I think that's only for a fraction of people that's probably the worst thing they could do and there's nothing wrong with that everybody's everybody's different right not everyone should adopt the way of the nerd but for a fraction of people it's a really really good thing to do this is normally the portion of a conversation with a guest where I list off the many many things they've done and how grateful I am and and all of that is absolutely true in the case of you being here today and the work you've done but I think it's self-evident how much you've uh not just accomplish but how much knowledge you've put into the world and not just scientific knowledge but knowledge about The Human Experience um of others and of yourself and so I just want to extend a giant thank you on behalf of the listeners and viewers and myself thank you for coming here today thank you for doing what you do and um so great to still have you here and to have this conversation and I hope it goes longer and no matter when it ends uh you've done an enormous service to humanity well thank you that's very kind it's been a it's been a pure pleasure to have this discussion with you thanks David thank you for

Transcript Language: English
Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Rena Malik. Dr. Rena Malik is a board-certified urologist and pelvic surgeon. She is an expert in both male and female urological, pelvic floor and sexual health. During today's episode, Dr. Malik answers the most commonly asked questions about urinary pelvic and sexual health, for instance, how to avoid getting UTIs, urinary tract infections. We also discuss pelvic floor anatomy and function as it relates to overcoming an overly tight or an overly relaxed pelvic floor. This is a key distinction that most people aren't aware of. Many people hear about the need to so-called strengthen their pelvic floor, but in fact, many people need to do the exact opposite. They need to learn to relax their pelvic floor in order to achieve proper urologic and sexual function. So today you'll learn about that. You will also learn about sexual health as it relates to erectile function, as it relates to things like vaginal lubrication, as it relates to orgasm. We separate out very carefully the difference between psychological desire and arousal that occurs within the genitals themselves. And Dr. Malik highlights some important misconceptions about sexual dysfunction. For instance, that many people believe that hormones are responsible for sexual dysfunction, but in reality, hormone dysregulation is responsible for only a very small percentage of sexual dysfunction. And yet, pelvic-floor and blood-flow-related issues can account for a large number of cases of sexual dysfunction in both males and females. So I assure you that today's discussion is going to illuminate many new areas of information, many new tools and protocols that I'm guessing most people have not heard of. We talk about the neural, vascular — that is, blood flow related — and muscular aspects of bladder function, prostate function, Skene's glands. We talk about vaginal health as well as penile health. We talk about these things as it relates to different stages across the lifespan. It is a far-reaching and in-depth and practical conversation that I'm certain everyone will glean important takeaways from. Now, before we go any further, I do want to highlight that the content of today's episode is sexual in nature. We talk very directly about different types of sexual behavior, and we talk about it from the standpoint of the clinician and biologist. So it is a medical/scientific discussion. That said, we can't be aware of where this podcast is being played and who is listening. And I assert that there are certain themes within today's discussion that would not be suitable for young children. How young? Well, that is certainly not for us to discern. We realize that different parents and different households should be the arbiters of what sorts of information their children are exposed to or not. So my suggestion would be that if you have any concern whatsoever that the content of today's episode would not be appropriate to be heard by some member of your family, that you please listen to the podcast first, or at least check the timestamps where we've detailed what specific topics are covered, and then to make your decision accordingly. I should mention that not only is Dr. Malik still an active clinician, she sees patients daily out of her clinic in Southern California, and we've provided a link to that clinic in the show note captions. She's also authored dozens of high-quality , peer-reviewed publications in the fields of urology, pelvic health, and sexual health, and we've also provided a link to that bibliography in the show note captions. And she is also a spectacular public educator. She provides zero-cost content about sexual health, pelvic floor health, and urology as it relates to both men and women on her YouTube channel. And there, too, we've provided a link to Dr. Malik's YouTube channel in the show note captions to this episode. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. Roka understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that you always see with perfect clarity. In addition, they are extremely lightweight and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty. Indeed, Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for performance in sports, but now they include aesthetics and styles that are really designed to be worn anytime. I, for instance, wear readers at night. I'll sometimes wear sunglasses during the day when I drive. And of course, I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight viewing, which I highly recommend everyone do their morning sunlight viewing. If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to Roka, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's Roka, roka.com. Enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs in order to allow you to get the best possible night's sleep. Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance. When we are sleeping well and enough, mental health, physical health and performance all stand to be at their best. One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailored to your unique sleep needs. Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz that if you go to their website, you take that quiz and answer questions such as, do you tend to sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach? Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night? Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions, and that's fine. At the end of that two-minute quiz, they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. I sleep on the DUSK, a D-U-S-K mattress, and when I started sleeping on a DUSK mattress about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helixleep.com/huberman. Take their two-minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you, and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows. Again, if interested, go to helixleep.com/huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows. We are always striving to make the Huberman Lab podcast better, and to that end, we need your help. Over the next month, we are going to be carrying out a survey. The purpose of the survey is to improve the Huberman Lab podcast according to your feedback. We put together a brief survey to understand what you love about the podcast — hopefully you love a few things at least, or maybe just one thing — as well as what you think could be improved, or perhaps the many things that you think could be improved about the Huberman Lab podcast. Basically what we are asking is to get your feedback so that we can improve any and all things about the Huberman Lab podcast. The survey does not take long and every single response will be reviewed. As a thank-you for completing the survey, we are offering two months free of the Huberman Lab Premium channel. If you're already a member of the Huberman Lab Premium channel, do not worry, you will get an additional two free months for carrying out this survey. You can find the link to the survey in the show notes for this podcast episode and on our website, hubermanlab.com. So if you would be so kind as to take a few minutes to fill out the survey and help us continue with bringing you the best possible content here at the Huberman Lab podcast. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. And now for my discussion with Dr. Rena Malik. Dr. Rena Malik, welcome. Dr. Rena Malik: Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor to be here. Andrew Huberman: I'm delighted to have you here. I'm a huge fan of your content. I find that you are able to deliver critical information about sexual health, urology, pelvic floor, libido, and so many other things that are of immense interest to people, but that ordinarily people don't really know where to get the high-quality information, and coming to you for that information means they are going to get the highest-quality information. I truly believe that because as everyone will soon hear today, we're going to have a very frank discussion, but one that's really grounded in science and medicine around sexual health and related topics. These are topics that typically people learn about, perhaps a little bit in school, maybe at home, from friends, usually overhearing things as opposed to direct exploratory conversation, online, pornography. And at least in my experience growing up, there was education around sexual health, reproductive health, et cetera that was more oriented toward the fear of things like STIs, fear of unwanted pregnancy, all of which, of course, is extremely important for people to learn about, but far less about sort of the healthy versions of sexual health. Right? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, absolutely. Andrew Huberman: So this is an especially important conversation. It's also one that I think has a backdrop that we should just acknowledge right off the bat, that because the information is gleaned from multiple sources, and because there are, let's just say, influences out there that relate to the morality of different practices, that there can be shame, there can be misunderstanding, there can be secrecy, and that further leads to misinformation. So I'm confident that today you can clarify things for us and we're going to stay out of those trenches. And the last thing I'd like to say is that because a number of terms will certainly come up that I think for some people, they're not used to hearing in general discourse. I'm just going to get them out of the way now. Penis, vagina, anus, prostate, what else is there? We're going to talk about libido. We're going to talk about intercourse, oral sex, anal sex. We're going to talk about all of that. So I just want to get that out there so that we can reduce the shock response. Dr. Rena Malik: I love it. We got to talk about all of it. Andrew Huberman: Great. So to start things off, in anticipation of this episode, I solicited for questions on social media, and I got thousands of questions, but there was a lot of overlap in the questions. So to start off, I'd like to talk about pelvic floor, because both males and females have a pelvic floor. And my understanding is that there's a muscular component, there's a neural-muscular component, there's a blood flow component. What is a healthy pelvic floor? What does a healthy pelvic floor do? And then we can talk about some of the health issues that an unhealthy pelvic floor creates and some of the ways to ameliorate an unhealthy pelvic floor. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. So a pelvic floor, very simply, is basically a bowl of muscles that's connected to bones that hold up all your organs. So basically, in your pelvis, there's all these muscles there, and their function is essentially many. It helps with urination, defecation, sexual function. It helps with posture. And so having a strong, healthy pelvic floor can mean that you're having normal urination, you're having normal defecation, you're having great sex, and that you are also not having ailments like back pain or issues related to those functions and those organs. And so pelvic floor is so important in so many different aspects, and we deal with it a lot as urologists because it's so integral to these functions that we take care of. And so when you have an unhealthy pelvic floor, it can vary from person to person. And while you hear about it a lot in women, men also suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction or problems with the pelvic floor. So, basically, pelvic floor dysfunction happens a lot when you're doing things like, if you were to go to the gym and do repetitions of any sort of exercise and you didn't rest, then that muscle would become contracted and short. Very similarly, if your pelvic floor is overstrained, it can become contracted and short and tight all the time. And you may not know it. It may just be a function of stress, anxiety, or overuse or posture problems, things of that nature that can affect your pelvic floor. And so this can lead to issues. Let's start with urination. You can have symptoms of urgency, frequency, meaning you have to go a lot to the bathroom, or you have to go and have a sudden desire that you can't delay, sometimes even have leakage. In some cases, it can make it difficult to urinate because the pelvic floor is so tense. Andrew Huberman: Or perhaps to incompletely vacate the bladder. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Andrew Huberman: Like, you go to urinate and then you go back to your desk, or then five minutes later, you have to urinate again. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly. Andrew Huberman: Something of that sort. Dr. Rena Malik: Well, it can be either that you're not emptying completely or that the pelvic floor muscles are so tense that they're stimulating the bladder so it feels like there's more to go. So it's not always that you're not evacuating it. It can present in a number of different ways. And then with sexual function, if it's very tense, you can have pain. So you can have pain with sex, you can have pain with erections, you can have pain with ejaculation. Sometimes it can be a lot of different kind of pain syndromes. And you're like, I have all these different things going on, and it's really just pelvic floor dysfunction. With GI function, you can definitely have constipation, and then often you can also have back pain. And so all of these things can happen when your pelvic floor is too tense. Sometimes your pelvic floor can be too weak. And that can be often because of, we see this in women a lot, because of childbirth, delivering children. With some people who have neurologic disorders, they can have weak pelvic floors or connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, for example. These sorts of things can cause weakness to the pelvic floor, which can then cause, very often what I see is, like urinary incontinence or leakage, which can, you know, create problems for people down the line. Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that. So, first question, how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight from an overcontraction or chronic contraction of the muscles there versus too weak? And one of the challenges in having this conversation is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bicep, I think everyone intuitively knows, because they've seen the shortening of the muscle is when the muscle is quote, unquote flexed, and the lengthening of the muscle is when it is relaxed. Is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening in a way that everyone can understand? Would this be — like I said, we're going to be direct today? Would this be like tensing up one's anus and the opposite of the movement that one would do before initiating a bowel movement, and relaxation is sort of the pattern of pelvic floor muscular relaxation just prior to initiating a bowel movement. Dr. Rena Malik: So I will say most people can't recognize it because it's very difficult to notice. It's sort of gradual, and so it can, over time, become noticeable with these symptoms. But otherwise, it's very difficult because it's not a muscle that we were ever trained to recognize. Right. Like, you hear about Kegel exercises, for example, and people talk about how to do them, but that's all you ever hear about the pelvic floor. And so you don't really know how to kind of do things in a way that protects your pelvic floor or kind of how to even tell when it's too tight or not relaxing. And so that takes a sort of training. And so usually when people come to, first you get an examination to see if your pelvic floor is tight. So for women, it's a pelvic exam, and for men, it's usually a rectal exam. Andrew Huberman: How does that exam go? Dr. Rena Malik: So it's essentially palpating the muscles and also looking at the function. So we'll say for--- Andrew Huberman: So digital palpation, where, that's a medical technology for, fingers are called digits. So I'm old enough to recognize what a digital prostate exam is, right. The physician inserts their fingers through into the anus and feels the prostate to see whether or not it's swollen or not. And as I'm saying this, I'm realizing sometimes we think of medicine, quote, unquote, modern medicine, as so evolved. This has basically been the practice for, what, 50 years, 60 years, maybe 100 years, in the same way that the old school practice for glaucoma, excessive eye pressure, was for the physician to just touch the eyeball. So, folks, for those of you that think that medicine has evolved much, it clearly has in many ways. But in any event, so a prostate exam goes as I just described. What would a pelvic floor exam for a male and a pelvic floor exam for a female involve at a kind of granular level here? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So for women, you can feel the pelvic floor muscles through the vagina. So you can feel the iliococcygeus, the pubococcygeus, the levator ani, those are all names of different muscles in this bowl. Andrew Huberman: This is the physician, who can feel them with their fingers. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. And you could, too. You could put your finger in, but you don't have a reference of normal. Right. So you wouldn't know what a normal pelvic floor feels like versus a tight one versus a weak one. And so you can assess the tenseness based on palpation. You can also see if there's tenderness. And so you can assess that based on just a general physical examination. And then also you can observe. So I can say, contract your... Squeeze your pelvic floor up and in. I can look and see, are they squeezing or are they pushing? Like, are they coordinated or not? Right. Because that's a function of normal use of the pelvic floor. And sometimes you'll see that they're discoordinated. You can also assess for sensation in the area and things like that. That could be consequences of dysfunction. Andrew Huberman: Can there be dysfunction in laterality? Like the pelvic floor is pulling up into the right or up into the left? Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. So what typically when you see a pelvic floor therapist. Now, I'm not a pelvic floor therapist, but these are the people who do the work, right? They work with you on a prolonged basis to help you normalize the function of your pelvic floor. It's like going to the gym with a trainer. Right? They really work with you to get your pelvic floor functioning correctly. And the first step to that, a lot of pelvic floor therapists will just align your bones and the way you sit and walk to make sure that you're not straining those muscles by pulling in different directions. Andrew Huberman: And if a male goes to the physician to get a pelvic floor exam, there's obviously difficulty in putting fingers into the urethra, one would hope too small an opening. So how are they doing the pelvic floor exam? Is it external to the body or is it through the anus? Dr. Rena Malik: So some of it's through the anus. You can feel the muscles through the anus, and then you can feel the perineal area and feel the muscles there as well as sensation. Andrew Huberman: Okay, so perineal area. So from the outside of the body, the region between the scrotum and the anus? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Andrew Huberman: Okay. So it sounds to me like if people want to get a high-quality assessment of whether or not their pelvic floor is healthy or not, they need to see a pelvic floor specialist. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Andrew Huberman: That it's not the sort of thing that they could intuit on their own, necessarily. Dr. Rena Malik: It would be difficult. I mean, so there are things you can buy online, like probes that you can insert in the vagina that will teach you how to do Kegel exercises and give you some readings, but they're not really meant to diagnose. They're usually something people use if they say, have a weak pelvic floor and they want to try to do it at home on their own. So there's nothing that's going to give you like a baseline reading — is this normal or abnormal? Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about Kegels. First of all, who's Kegel? Dr. Rena Malik: So he is a gynecologist. I don't remember all the specifics, to be quite honest, but basically he came up with Kegels, which are a strengthening exercise for the pelvic floor. And so what it is, what we describe it to for patients is we say, you're going to, there's a few different ways to describe it. You're going to use the muscles that you use when you urinate, but try to stop the flow, but you don't want to do them when you're urinating because that can create dysfunction. You want to learn what the muscles are and then you squeeze those muscles and relax in between sets, so to speak. And so the other way people describe it is pulling up and in the vagina, or for men, sometimes you'll say it's like the feeling that you're trying to lift your penis off the floor without touching it. Right. So those are kind of using--- Andrew Huberman: That's a good way to describe it. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Dr. Rena Malik: So those are kind of the ways that you can describe those muscles. And so you can squeeze for 5 seconds and relax for 5 seconds and do them in repetitions. And they're just like any sort of exercise you do, you don't want to start doing 100 of them, right? You want to do them... I tell them people, I tell patients, do them lying down so that you're only focusing on those muscles, you're not working on your posture, you're not doing anything else. And as you get better with them lying down, you then sit up and do them. And then once you're good with them sitting up, you can do them standing and start with 10 to 15 at a time, like once. Andrew Huberman: Ten to 15 repetitions. So, yeah, let's talk sets and rep. Dr. Rena Malik: So, yeah, 10 to 15 repetitions in the morning, 10 to 15 repetitions at night, maybe one more during the middle of the day, but don't overdo it, because just like anything, especially when you're starting out, you can. And if you're doing tons and tons of Kegels, then you will get a tight, short pelvic floor muscles, and you will then develop pelvic floor dysfunction. So it's really important to kind of understand those mechanics, which is why a lot of people think they know how to do Kegels, but they really don't. And so I always encourage people, if you have the time and the resources, to go to a pelvic floor physical therapist so they can really work with you and make sure you're doing them correctly. Andrew Huberman: What are some of the benefits of Kegels for those that need them? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. So they are typically prescribed for urinary incontinence, specifically stress urinary incontinence. So leakage that occurs when you have an increase in your intra-abdominal pressure, like a Valsalva, or coughing, sneezing, lifting heavy things, jumping on a trampoline. So for those purposes, we use Kegels to strengthen the pelvic floor, and also in women, pelvic organ prolapse. So when you have weakness of the pelvic floor, that leads to a bulge that you can visibly see or feel in the vagina. For men, we often prescribe them for people who have had a prostatectomy, who then subsequently develop leakage after the prostatectomy, that is, again, stress urinary incontinence. Now, a lot of people use Kegels recreationally because improving the pelvic floor musculature can lead to more intense pelvic floor contractions during orgasm, which can be more pleasurable. And so some people do it for those purposes. But again, I caution people not to overdo it, because then you can lead to a more tense pelvic floor, which is not where we want to end up. Andrew Huberman: Yes, I will underscore that cautionary note. Years ago, I heard about Kegels. I was like, okay, I'll try. It sounds all good, right? I only heard good things about Kegels, and what it quickly resulted in was painful urination. And I thought, this is weird. Everyone's saying Kegels are so great. And the best thing I could do for my pelvic floor, it seemed, was to avoid Kegels. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Andrew Huberman: And a little bit later, when we're talking about prostate, I'll explain at least what my experience was as it relates to the prostate. But I guess the take-home message that I'm gathering from what you're telling us is that strengthening the pelvic floor is great. If you have a weak pelvic floor, strengthening your pelvic floor further, if you have a strong pelvic floor, can be detrimental. Dr. Rena Malik: It can be. It can be if you overtrain it, just like if you overtrain anything else. And so if you really want to do Kegels, if you have any symptoms at all like you described, painful urination, or the things I've described, like pain with erections, pain with ejaculation, pain, difficulty emptying, any of those symptoms, stop and go see a urologist so that they can kind of assess your pelvic floor. Andrew Huberman: What is the anti-Kegel? In other words, if somebody decides that they have a tight pelvic floor, how can they learn to relax their pelvic floor? Dr. Rena Malik: So there's a lot of different sort of things that you can do. So for women, you can do massage of the area. You can use vaginal dilators to help relax the muscles. You can take suppositories that have medications like Valium or baclofen, which are muscle relaxants. And that can help as well. Although they're not treatments, they're more of a band-aid, but they can help with the symptoms that you're having. And then you can also, I think the best thing is to work with a physical therapist because they can teach you certain exercises that will help down train the pelvic floor. For example, one of the ones I tell my patients is like, happy baby pose. It actually stretches and elongates the pelvic floor muscles. So doing these exercises regularly will help you lengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Andrew Huberman: One thing that I've experienced extreme pain from and that stopping was one of the best things that ever happened for my pelvic floor, was to not do any kind of crunching movement with my legs crossed. I would go to these yoga classes at one point in my life, and they'd have everybody do these crunches. And I've always done some abdominal work here and there during the week if I'm being diligent. But they would have us cross our feet, and that seemed to lead to some pelvic floor discomfort that was similar to what I had experienced when I did the Kegels. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: So, again, for me, ceasing the Kegels was one of the best decisions I ever made. I only did them for a short while. I was like, okay, this is clearly not for me. And I guess that's another point that tell me if you agree or not, that if you hear about something online or on this podcast or anywhere else, and you try it, and it seems to be sending things in the wrong direction. Either you're doing it wrong, or it might not be the right thing for you. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly. Andrew Huberman: I think all too often we hear, this thing is great, and people jump on that bandwagon, and then they end up worsening their problems or developing problems where they didn't have them previously. But is there anything about the anatomy of the neuromuscular connections or vasculature of the pelvic floor that would provide support for my experience there? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: That doing crunches with legs crossed is essentially, is it possible that it's creating asymmetries in the pelvic floor? And now I'm sure I'm angering yoga teachers and crunchanistas everywhere. But, you know, hey, if it's a question of your pelvic floor or a few extra delineations in your abs, you know where my vote is going. Dr. Rena Malik: So there's a couple of things here that we should dive into. One is that people don't often breathe correctly during exercise, right. And so diaphragmatic breathing is really important, which is like a deep breath that expands the diaphragm. Not kind of shallow breathing. That's just in your mouth and throat. And that is actually when you do any sort of exercise, your trainer will tell you, exhale on the effort. Right? And there's a reason for that, because when you inhale, your pelvic floor relaxes. When you exhale, your pelvic floor contracts. And so, actually, that contraction stabilizes the pelvic floor, so whatever intra-abdominal pressure you're causing to increase from the exercise, whether it's a squat or a crunch or whatever, you're increasing your abdominal pressure. Your pelvic floor is then contracting to help stabilize that. And so part of the reason people tend to hold their breath during crunches, right. They don't do the appropriate breathing. And so that can be part of it. The other thing that can happen with certain things is that there are nerves and arteries, particularly the pudendal nerve and the pudendal artery that run through the pelvic floor. So when you get pelvic floor dysfunction, you can cause decreased blood flow to the pelvic floor muscles, which can affect sexual function, and you can get nerve inflammation as well, that can also cause pain. And so this is kind of how it all comes together. Andrew Huberman: I'm so glad that you mentioned blood flow. I think our entire discussion today should be framed up, at least in the back of our minds and the minds of our listeners and viewers, as involving at least three things. Anytime we're talking about erectile function or dysfunction or pelvic floor function or dysfunction or vaginal lubrication or lack thereof, we need to think about the hormonal influences, the blood flow related influences, and the neural influences, including the neural influences that come from the brain, the signals of arousal, for instance, or lack of arousal, and so on. So we won't be overly systematic in our parsing of all this, but I think what you just mentioned raises a really important point, that sometimes in an effort to do something that's good for the muscles, like strengthen the muscles, one will cut off blood flow. In fact, one of the more common questions I got, and I consulted with a couple of exercise physiologists about this, and they confirmed that a lot of people who squat and deadlift heavy in the gym or even who just tense their pelvic floor when they're doing things like dumbbell curls or other exercises, and especially people who seem to do a lot of abdominal work, reported to me in the questions that they experienced things like erectile dysfunction, that they experienced things like pain during vaginal intercourse, that essentially they had created some sort of what sounds to me like a hypercontraction of the muscles in that area that were impeding all the things that they wanted, as either side effects or direct effects of exercise, because many people are exercising for aesthetic reasons and health reasons, but nowadays, it seems, especially on the male side... But we will also talk about the role of testosterone on the female side. A lot of males lift weights in order to increase their testosterone and, for reasons that are obvious, also want to have healthy sexual function. And here they are doing this thing that's very good for increasing testosterone if they're doing it correctly. And testosterone is involved in libido and the male sexual response, and the female sexual response, of course, but they are impeding their erections. So you can start to see how there are probably a lot of confused and maybe even distraught people out there. They're trying to do all the right things, and they're setting up roadblocks and even sending themselves backward in some cases. So the question is, how does one know whether or not something like, let's say, low lubrication or pain during vaginal intercourse or loss of erectile strength or some sort of erectile dysfunction, whatever it may be, because it can take on different forms, as we'll talk about. How does one know if it's blood flow related, hormone related, or neural related? And if it's neural related, how does one know if it's an issue of lack of appropriate signals from the brain, oversuppression or lack of arousal from the brain, or whether or not it's some peripheral neural thing of innervation of the penis or vagina? Dr. Rena Malik: So I think there's a lot that we can go into here, but essentially, first you want to find out very specifically what is going on. Are you getting aroused? Are you having erections? Are you masturbating? Like, there's all these questions that will help us go down the route. Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt, when you say aroused, for sake of this discussion, I just want to make sure that we distinguish between psychological arousal, the desire. I guess here we also have to be precise. Arousal to engage in intercourse, arousal to desire, essentially, that I think people would learn to recognize. Or are we talking about arousal as the response of the genitals? Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. So desire and arousal, this is a very important concept, doesn't always go in one direction. Sometimes you can feel arousal, meaning you have the telltale signs of arousal. Your nipples get erect, you have more lubrication if you're a female. Andrew Huberman: Do both male and female nipples get erect during arousal? Dr. Rena Malik: I believe so. Andrew Huberman: I think so. Dr. Rena Malik: You maybe get the sex flush, right? You get some redness or warmth feeling. That's your body's response to arousal. And sometimes that can be an erection, and sometimes that's not. Not having an erection does not mean you're not aroused. It may mean other things, but certainly that's part of it. And then desire, do you want to have sex? When you think about your partner or whoever you want to engage with, is there a desire to actually do that? Right? Or is it just more of obligation or other things? And it doesn't matter if the desire comes after arousal. For some women in particular, we see that they may not have the desire right away, but they want to be intimate or close with their partner, and so they'll start just being close with them, and then arousal will come. And then, oh, yeah, I like this. So then the desire comes after, and that's normal. That's totally fine. So you want to kind of parse that out. And then for men, you can ask, are you getting erections at night? Because that will tell us the function of your organ at night versus during the day, where you have also psychogenic components. Right. You can really get in your head about erections when you have a problem in the bedroom with performance; it becomes a vicious cycle. Right. So you have a problem the next time you're really stressed. You're not present, you're not mindful in the moment with sex, and you're thinking about, oh, my God, am I going to perform okay? Am I going to perform okay? And then it doesn't perform again, and it's getting worse and worse, and the anxiety is through the roof, and that's actually causing your sexual dysfunction. So I think it's important first to identify those issues and then also for blood flow. A lot of times, we can assess based on, well, what other comorbidities do you have? Do you have other issues ongoing that may be affecting your blood flow? Most common, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and if you smoke, all of those things will affect blood flow to the genitals. And so that will point us--- Andrew Huberman: Negatively. Dr. Rena Malik: Negatively. Negatively. So that will point us to a more vascular issue. Hormonal issues are very important for desire, as far as sexual function in terms of erections, there's only 3% of erectile dysfunction that's related to hormones. Andrew Huberman: But that's pure erectile function. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Andrew Huberman: As opposed to desire. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Desire is predominantly modulated by the hormone testosterone for both men and women. In fact, a lot of people don't know this, but women have more testosterone in their bodies than they actually have estrogen. So testosterone is very important for both men and women for a variety of reasons. And so using that discussion with the patient will help you kind of identify where you're headed in terms of what you need to focus on for treatment. There are certain things you can use to assess blood flow. You can do Doppler ultrasounds of the penis as well as the clitoris to see if there is good blood flow. You can assess the peak systolic velocity, which will tell you if there's a problem with arterial inflow versus the end-diastolic velocity, which will tell you if there's a problem with venous outflow. And so that can assess those things. There are some tests you can do for nerve function, although they're very uncommonly done, because mostly we can kind of get that through clinical report. And unfortunately, if you're having nerve problems, sometimes it depends on what's causing them, but sometimes they can be very difficult to reverse, and that's kind of a problem. We know that as people age, their sensation becomes less. So just through aging, the nerves, the receptors become less sensitive, and so you will generally have less responsiveness to the same sensations you did when you were younger. And so that kind of overlays all of this. So it's complex, but really, a lot of it comes from the discussion you have with your patient, or you kind of really doing a deep dive in what's going on, like really thinking about each of those aspects and also what's going on in your relationship and what's going on in your life, stress, anxiety, how are those playing a role? Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman. Gosh, lots there to unpack. And I'm glad you mentioned the relationship itself, because there are all sorts of things that can impact the arousal response — novelty. Not everyone's in a committed relationship. Whether or not people are engaging in a lot of masturbation to the point of ejaculation or climax or not, pornography, et cetera, we will get into that. It's a vast space to explore. Before we go any further, I want to make sure, however, that we cue people to where and how they could find a really good, let's say, pelvic floor therapist, and where they could find a really great urologist to do the sorts of exams and perhaps the sorts of treatments that we've talked about. Because at least as far as I understand, much of what people want to learn on this podcast is how things work and what happens when things break down, but also how to resolve those issues. So let's say somebody wants to check out their pelvic floor, figure out what's going on there. Maybe they're having issues, maybe they're not. If they are male or female, where do they go? Is there a place online that has a great list of some of the best ones in one's area? Can it be done over telemedicine? How does one go about that? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So in terms of your pelvic floor, it's good to get assessed by a physician who specializes in pelvic floor. Now, that could be a urologist, that could be a gynecologist or even a physical medicine rehabilitation doctor that specializes in pelvic floor health. So typically you'll see in urology, you'll look for people who are board-certified in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery if you're a woman, if you're a man, maybe sexual medicine, someone who specializes in sexual medicine would be a good place to look. For gynecologists, again, you want to look at someone who has interest in this area, who does manage pelvic floor. And then in terms of pelvic floor physical medicine rehabilitation, at least when I was in training, there was about 20 PMRs doctors around the country who really focused on this, so it's not a lot of people. If you can go to a pelvic floor physical therapist and you have one near you, that's great as well. You do want to make sure that one, they do, are certified in pelvic floor physical therapy and that they have taken care of your gender. So if you have male anatomy, then you want to go to someone who's actually seen men, because a lot of the pelvic floor physical therapists tend to treat a lot of women. And so that's kind of what I tell my patients, generally speaking. There's no, at least to my knowledge, no great resource. And maybe we'll look that up and see if we can find one. Andrew Huberman: That's very helpful. Thank you. Because again, going back to what I said at the beginning of our conversation, I think there's a lot of shame, or at least a lack of clarity as to how one gets help for issues that relate to the genitals. Because if you have a headache or you're having an eye issue, I mean, you sort of know where to go. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Hopefully your headache doesn't warrant going to a neurologist, but it might. Eye stuff tends to be ophthalmologists, optometrists. Right. So I don't think we hear often enough about where to access the best quality care for these things, so thank you for that. In thinking about sexual dysfunction, I'd like to have that conversation, more or less in parallel, if we can, around male sexual dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. And I want to make sure that before we do that, that I'm creating the correct parallel construction as they say. Erectile dysfunction in males is clearly a form of sexual dysfunction. What is the parallel to erectile dysfunction in females? Is it lack of vaginal lubrication and lack of relaxation of the vagina to have nonpainful intercourse? Is it even possible to have a parallel conversation about these two things? Dr. Rena Malik: So, it's different. In some circumstances there are homologues, right? So the penis is the homologue of the clitoris. Andrew Huberman: Right. Dr. Rena Malik: So the clitoris is essentially the same sort of spongy erectile tissue that you see in the penis ; it gets erect with arousal, and it actually extends very deep into the pelvis. So it's not just a small little organ, it's actually quite long. And so you can, in men you can have erectile dysfunction because you can see it, but in women, you may have difficulty with orgasm. And it's not exactly a parallel, but difficulty orgasming in women is multifactorial, and we can get into that. But I think they're different, and I think also sexual dysfunction presents differently in both genders. So when you talk about men, the one visual they see of arousal is erections. And so it becomes very ingrained in your psyche that if I don't have an erection, I'm not aroused. Right. But there's a lot of reasons that you might not have an erection that we've sort of touched on, vascular problems, hormonal problems, neurologic problems, psychogenic issues, and other medications you're taking. So there are issues that can affect erectile function, that can be a part of it, where you might feel like you have low desire because your arousal is not there. And that becomes a little bit confusing for women. What they can assess is their level of lubrication, if sex hurts, and if they get an orgasm. And so those are kind of the ways you can look at it. Andrew Huberman: Thank you for fleshing all of that out. You know years ago, I worked on sexual differentiation and in particular the role of hormones in sexual differentiation. And indeed, as you described, we learned because we were taught, and I think people still generally agree, that if one looks at the embryological origins of the penis and the clitoris, they are essentially analogous structures. And that a lot of male genital development involves, literally the regression, the disappearance of the female sexual genitalia and associated organs, müllerian ducts and things like that, and what would become the ovaries become the testes, et cetera, et cetera. Those are anatomical parallels. But what you just described for us very beautifully is the sort of functional parallels as it relates to sexual function and dysfunction. So I'm hoping with that framing that we can knock down a few of these pins in a little less time, because there's a lot to tackle here. First off, I'd like to address the hormonal issues. You mentioned that only 3% of erectile dysfunction, and by extension, can we say also female issues with sexual arousal, are hormonal in origin, is that right? Dr. Rena Malik: So with desire, yes. Andrew Huberman: Ok. Dr. Rena Malik: They are hormonal in general. And arousal in terms of lubrication, if you're using that as a barometer, yes you can see less vaginal lubrication due to hormones, and I guess I would say 3 to 6% more, you know. Up to 6% we see of erectile dysfunction is hormonal. It's a small percentage of the entirety of erectile dysfunction. Andrew Huberman: Okay. So I think in looking on the landscape of social media, podcasts, and just in the common mindset, we've all come to believe that testosterone is pro-libido. It's pro-desire in men and women. I think now people are starting to appreciate that it's pro-desire in women as well, but certainly in men, and that dopamine is also associated with desire. And the general public tends to have this view of estrogen as being sort of anti-libido or anti-male, which is frankly false. In fact, and I've covered this on the podcast with Dr. Kyle Gillett and with Dr. Peter Attia and another fellow YouTuber, Derek from More Plates, More Dates, has talked a lot about the fact that if people, if men take drugs like an anastrozole to suppress their estrogen, thinking that, oh, it's all about having high testosterone, low estrogen, oftentimes they crush their libido. Just abolish it. Which has led to a slowly growing, but I think, positive shift in how people are thinking about estrogen. Estrogen is great for brain function, estrogen is great for libido in men and women. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Andrew Huberman: And that is a revision of, I think, how most people think of the male sexual response. It's more in keeping with how people think about the female sexual response. Oh, estrogen in the female sexual response. That makes sense, but what we're trying to do here is clarify some of the misconceptions. Now, the reason I mentioned dopamine is that my understanding is that dopamine is involved in the desire response. We will distinguish desire, the psychological arousal, from genital arousal, physical arousal, and that prolactin is associated with the refractory period during which erection can't occur, another, perhaps, orgasm can't occur in females, et cetera. But my understanding is, that's also not that simple, and we need to take a step back, perhaps, and just talk about the physiological underpinnings of the desire and arousal response. So I'll tell you what I was taught, and then you can tell me where it's wrong. Dr. Rena Malik: Sure. Andrew Huberman: I hope. I was taught that the erection response and the vaginal lubrication response is generated by the parasympathetic nervous system, the relaxed, the rest-and-digest aspect of the nervous system. Hence why some people can get psychogenic sexual issues of lack of erection or lack of vaginal lubrication, but that there are individuals out there for whom a lot of alertness, maybe even, and this is a controversial thing, but for some people, even some sense of aggression or kind of edginess or excitement, adrenaline, in other words, can stimulate erection or vaginal lubrication. So it gets tricky. It's not like the textbooks. It's not like they taught us in high school, as far as I know. I was taught that the arousal response in males and females is initiated by a parasympathetic sort of relaxed tone. And that as sexual desire and arousal and sex or masturbation progresses, that it shifts more towards the sympathetic nervous system, which has nothing to do with emotional sympathy and has everything to do with arousal. The catecholamines — dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline — are released. And that the climax response, which may or may not include ejaculation, we have to separate that out, is one that is really of the stress system of the body. And then in the postcoital or postejaculatory or postclimax phase, then there's a shift back to the parasympathetic nervous system. That's where the pillow talk and the exchange of odors and tastes and other molecules is known to enhance pair bonding through things like oxytocin, vasopressin, and so on. And what I just described is exceedingly oversimplified, I realize. But is that more or less how the physiology works? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So the way we're taught in medical school is point and shoot. So point is the parasympathetic nervous system. Andrew Huberman: All the male audience will like that one. Dr. Rena Malik: And then you go on to the sympathetic nervous system. But it makes sense. And the reason that I think you're hearing about this aggression, or these things that are leading to arousal is because there needs to be a stimulus, right? A visual stimulus, a tactile stimulus, some sort of stimulus that you're getting that is then causing the release of nitric oxide from the parasympathetic nervous system. And that could be, for some people, aggression or some form of that, right. Andrew Huberman: Can you tell people about nitric oxide? Because we'll get into this when we talk about drugs that increase blood flow, Cialis, Viagra, and also nonprescription drugs, things like L-citrulline, arginine, and watermelon, for that matter. Right? So I read on the internet. Dr. Rena Malik: So nitric oxide is essentially the ignition for, what we say, for erections. The ignition for erections. The reason I talk about erections more often is when you look at the data, in fact, there was a paper on this where they looked at the number of articles that came up when you put in the word "penis" and the number of articles that came up when you put in the word "clitoris." And it was 50,000 about penis and 2000 about the clitoris. Andrew Huberman: Okay. This was actually a major section of the comments when I asked for questions on Instagram, and comments on comments, and yeah, how come? Why not? Et cetera? Is that because the urology and sexual health field was dominated by men? That's going to be the presumption. Or is it because it's easier to study mean? What's going on here? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, I think there's been a lot, I mean you can go back to, like, Freud, where he thought that the female sexual response was less valuable. And so there are some reasons--- Andrew Huberman: Less valuable? Dr. Rena Malik: I guess, I don't know if that's the right term, but he--- Andrew Huberman: Oh no, no, I'm not challenging your term, I just meant--- Dr. Rena Malik: Like, you know, it was sort of dismissed. Andrew Huberman: He seemed to be obsessed with it, right? Dr. Rena Malik: But it was more about the male sexual response than the female sexual response. And so in general, yes, there is, you know, there were more men in medicine, there was more, and it is easier to study. Right. You can't study the clitoris as, quite as easy as you can study the male penis response because you can see it visually, you can inject it and see an erection response. Right. We do this for people who have erectile dysfunction, they'll take medications that increase blood flow, like Trimix. And you'll inject it into the penis, and you'll see an erection. So you can actually--- Andrew Huberman: Trimix. Dr. Rena Malik: Trimix. So there's, it's, it includes--- Andrew Huberman: The entire male audience just went, wait, what are you injecting? Dr. Rena Malik: So, there are three, basically, brand names of intracavernosal injections that we use for erectile dysfunction. Andrew Huberman: I hear "injection in penis," and I think it's, I like to think that it reflects a natural male response. I sort of, I... taken aback. I don't know, maybe there's a pelvic floor contraction in there someplace. Dr. Rena Malik: So it is scary to hear about. It's a very small needle. It is very well tolerated. I've done it to patients in the office and they look at me and say, you're done. It's not as painful as it seems. And when you are not having erections and you've tried multiple things, people get to the point where they're willing to try that. And so, it is very effective. It is the most effective nonsurgical treatment we have for erectile dysfunction. And it's usually either one medication, two medications or three. So you can have alprostadil, papaverine, and what's the third one? Andrew Huberman: That's okay, we can look at, someone will put it in the comments. Dr. Rena Malik: Sure. Andrew Huberman: Surely they will. What is it designed to do? Is it a vasodilator of sorts? Dr. Rena Malik: So they work in different mechanisms, but similar to the medications that we have. PDE5 inhibitors. PDE5 inhibitors work in the erection cascade. Basically, what happens, actually, let's take it back to the nitric oxide thing and we'll get there. So nitric oxide essentially is released by the endothelium in response to a visual-tactile stimulating cue. Right? And so your body releases nitric oxide, which then sets off the cascade for the erection. And so that releases c-GMP, which causes the erection, and it's degraded by phosphodiesterase. And so medications that inhibit phosphodiesterase, like Viagra and Cialis, tend to prevent the breakdown of that c-GMP, so you have longer-lasting erections. And so similarly these medications work sort of similar to that. Some of them, we don't know exactly how they work, but they work by increasing cGMP or cAMP that are involved in those cascades. Andrew Huberman: And what about L-citrulline? I hear about L-citrulline used, it's an over-the-counter supplement, and it's in the arginine pathway. And my understanding is that it works similarly to things like Cialis, Viagra, but is perhaps not as potent. I also just — cautionary note out there, L-citrulline can give people vicious cold sores and canker sores. Vicious. You hear about this on the internet. It's been verified by grotesque images that you do not want to Google for, and not everyone tolerates it well. Dr. Rena Malik: So these actually work by increasing nitric oxide. So they're not later down the pathway, they're actually increasing the availability of nitric oxide. So L-arginine is the more direct pathway, but it's very low bioavailability. L-citrulline converts to L-arginine, but it lasts much longer in the bloodstream, which is why people tend to use L-citrulline. Now, you know, in sexual medicine, these supplements, while there has been some studies on them and they are effective, there's no regulation on the supplement industry, so we can recommend them, but we just can't say that for sure that the supplement is exactly what's said on the bottle. We see lots of studies where they'll say, I read one about melatonin and there's a variation of melatonin from what's on the bottle to 400% times more. And so that's kind of the struggle that we as medical doctors have. And I know we get a lot of slack for it, that we don't talk about supplements, but it's really the challenge there is like finding the quality supplements. Andrew Huberman: A great site, which I have no relationship to, except that I mention them all the time, is examine.com , which has references to human studies and where there's a lot of efficacy shown and will get into some side effect. Can't address quality by brand issues, but thanks for mentioning that. What percentage of males who take Cialis, aka tadalafil, or Viagra, for erectile dysfunction get relief from that? Because you mentioned only 3% of erectile issues in males are hormonal in origin. But what percentage are likely to be blood-flow related in origin? Dr. Rena Malik: So a large percentage are blood-flow related. That doesn't mean that the medication will be effective for everyone. If you look at the large percentage are vascular in nature, right? That's the number one cause as men age. So we know that about 50% or 52% of men over the age of 40 will have erectile dysfunction, and that continues to increase as you age. So 50% of 50-year-olds, 60% of 60-year-olds, and so on and so forth. So it's very, very common. And the success rate in the studies is about 60% to 70%. So when you give someone a medication, they will have sustained erections that are sufficient for penetrative intercourse, which is the way we kind of discuss erectile dysfunction in studies and with patients, is about 60% to 70%. So not everyone will have success, but not all of that is because the medication doesn't work. Sometimes people are not taking them correctly, sometimes people need to try different doses, and then there's still this issue of your brain is still active, and so if you're having anxiety or you're having other issues or stress in your life, that can have an effect on your ability to create an erection. So there's lots of factors that go into it, but generally speaking, they are effective and they do work quite well and they're tolerated pretty well. Andrew Huberman: Sixty percent to 70% is not a small number. That's a significant number. That's the majority, but by a significant margin. Is there a basis for the use of Cialis, tadalafil, Viagra, L-citrulline in females? Dr. Rena Malik: So, yeah, there's not a lot of data on this, but certainly, if you have surmised that there is a blood-flow issue and they're having difficulties with orgasm, it's certainly something you can try off-label. And certainly people do try these medications off-label to see if they improve sexual function for women. But there's not a whole bunch of robust, randomized, controlled trial studies on women with these medications. Andrew Huberman: A little bit later, we will talk about prostate health specifically, but I'm just going to make a note here that nowadays there's increasing use of low-dosage Cialis/ tadalafil. So rather than, what I found online was that the erectile dysfunction treatment dosage of Cialis/tadalafil is somewhere in the 15-to-20-mg range. What we're talking about here is daily use of 2.5 to 5 mg of Cialis/tadalafil for prostate health. And I learned in researching for this episode that tadalafil/Cialis was actually developed as a drug for the treatment of prostate health to essentially increase blood flow of the prostate, to increase prostate health, not for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. So I found that to be somewhat interesting, and a lot of people are now starting to use that. I also learned that if you dive into the guts of the internet, one can find that now there's a growing use of combined low-dosage Cialis and apomorphine, which is a prodopaminergic agent. And we'll get back to dopamine a little bit later, but is there any basis for low dosage, say, 2.5 to 5 mg daily use of Cialis/tadalafil in females? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Well, let's talk about it for males and females. I think low-dose daily Cialis is excellent for erectile function in men, even--- Andrew Huberman: Is that true even, sorry to interrupt, but is that true even for men that are not experiencing erectile dysfunction? Dr. Rena Malik: It's not indicated for that purpose, but there's a thought that it's increasing blood flow to the area. So people, I've personally used it for men who have pelvic pain to help with increasing blood flow, you can also use it potentially as a preventative. So some people have kind of thought, okay, it's increasing blood flow, it's preventing fibrosis of that erectile tissue that can happen with age or other vascular problems, so it may be beneficial for that as well. Although, again, that's off-label and not something that we generally promote. As far as for women, again, it can help with blood flow. So if you're having issues, so if you have a female who's having sexual dysfunction and she's got signs of vascular problems, like she's got diabetes, high blood pressure, she smokes, then yes, it's certainly reasonable to try and see how they do. Usually you want to give at least a four-week trial to see if there's any benefit with those medications. Andrew Huberman: Great, thank you for that. Why is it that I get so many questions about erectile dysfunction from males who are in their 20s and 30s? Because everything you said up until now was mainly focused on men 40 years and older. Is it from lack of physical activity, overuse of nicotine? By the way, vaping, as far as we know, vaping and smoking, bad for erectile function and perhaps sexual health in males and females generally. Because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor. Nicotine does have certain benefits, and I covered this in an episode on nicotine. Neurocognitive benefits in the elderly in particular. But it is a vasoconstrictor, so it runs against all of the sexual arousal stuff that we're talking about. But okay, let's assume that a male in their 20s or 30s is sleeping enough, six to eight hours a night, is exercising, isn't doing anything to punish their pelvic floor in the gym, and they're not doing legs-crossed Kegels while doing crunches or something while inhaling on the crunch. That was a quiz, by the way, folks. For earlier topics covered. Let's assume they're eating pretty well. The majority of their foods are coming from nonprocessed or minimally processed foods. They're doing a little meditation each day. They're engaging in, hopefully healthy relationships. They're not masturbating like crazy to porn. And let's assume that they are not on any SSRI, why are all these 20- and 30-year-olds on the internet asking — mainly you, they mainly run to you — but also to my direct messages about their erectile issues? Dr. Rena Malik: So I will say I have seen a lot of young men in my clinic, and I will say that they very often have pelvic floor dysfunction. So even though they're doing all the right things, we're in a stressful society. So you can try all the things to decrease your stress. But a lot of us are sitting long periods of time, especially during COVID I mean, people sat for months, right, years, like, just sitting at their home computer. And so exercising one hour is not going to offset the day full of sitting. And so all of those things can affect pelvic floor function. So my theory is that that's probably the more common cause--- Andrew Huberman: So walk more. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I've actually heard that --- Dr. Rena Malik: Or use a standing desk. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Walk more. Standing desk. Okay, so, and then my guess is that there's some psychogenic feedback loop. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: Which is just nerdspeak for things aren't working as well as they would like, then they're stressing about it, and the stress is making things worse. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. And you mentioned that people are not masturbating or using porn, but a lot of people learn about sex through porn. Whether it's good or bad, it's not a great thing, but that's accessible now. When we were growing up, you had to find a VCR, you had to find a quiet room that no one was going to walk in. Andrew Huberman: I'm old enough to remember when the kid down the street, I won't mention him by last name, but, yeah, the kid down the street had porno magazines. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, or magazines. Andrew Huberman: And then there was actually a library of these. Goodness I shouldn't say where they were. In the town I grew up in, where kids would stash them in specific locations in parking lots, and then boys would bike or skateboard over or walk over, and then they would take turns looking at them. But that actually is to raise perhaps a more important point, which is that looking at pornography is different than masturbating to pornography, which is also different than masturbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation. Right. Because I also get a lot of questions from people about their porn addiction issues. And there's a growing theory out there that overuse that, meaning not just looking at but masturbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation, is creating a deficit of seeking out and cultivating healthy, real-world sexual interactions. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So I want to start this before I get into that is to say that if you're masturbating to porn and you have normal, healthy relationships and you're going to work and you have a great partner, and everything's great in your life, it's okay. Like, shame is a real problem, and--- Andrew Huberman: Maybe they're watching pornography together. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So I think it's important, though, that at least in the literature, they don't describe porn addiction, they call it problematic pornography use, and it's only described in about 4% of people in these studies. So it's a small subset of people. I think it's becoming more common because pornography is so accessible, and it activates the dopamine pathways just like any other sort of addiction. Right. You watch pornography, you get a dopamine response. Your brain then says, oh, I want that again. And you keep seeking more novel, more aggressive, different types of pornography to get that same response. But it doesn't happen to everybody. Andrew Huberman: But also, I would say, sorry to interrupt, but that the dopamine response, as a hardwired biological mechanism, for adaptive behaviors, including, and let's just define healthy sexual behavior, because I feel like there's such a range on that, depending on one's background, religious beliefs, et cetera. Anytime we talk about sex on this podcast, I like to say that involves at least four things — obviously, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes, absolutely. I'm really glad you brought that up. So I've heard you say that before, but it's very important. I think there is a large spectrum of people who watch pornography, ejaculate to pornography, and have a normal life, and so that's fine. I think that if we shame those people, we're creating problems. Right? We say, like, oh, you do that, that's horrible. And then they're in their head. Right? And then they're causing problems in their life because of shame. And so I think there's a little bit of cultural shame that comes of this discussion. And so it's a problem in the long term if we say that, oh, this is going to create problems, because not everyone has, there's so many people who watch pornography and have no problems. Who you know, have normal, healthy relationships, great sex with their partner, and it's fine. Andrew Huberman: Or they're between relationships. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah Andrew Huberman: And they're relying on masturbation specifically. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Andrew Huberman: Are there any data that distinguish between just pure imagination, fantasy versus visual fantasy as it relates to developing or inhibiting sexual health? And here we're talking about the desire aspect. Let's assume physical arousal is handled, no pun intended. Dr. Rena Malik: So I think that the thing about young people, I wanted to get back to that, then I'll answer your question, but the thing about young people who are watching pornography, that's what they think sex is supposed to be like, they don't get an education about what sex is. Right. No one has a conversation with their kids like, hey guys, this is what happens when you have sex, this is how long it should take, this is what foreplay is. And this is not normal. This is a production. This is a produced product that's meant to arouse you. Right. And to give you ideally an ejaculation or an orgasm. Right. So no one has that discussion. So then go to relationships like, why did my partner not react like that woman did on the porno, right? Or why did I not react like that woman did on the porno? Andrew Huberman: Or why didn't he react like they would in porn? Because again, I think females are watching porn as well. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly. Yeah. Andrew Huberman: So I think that you raise a really critical point, which is that the shame can extend both ways. Dr. Rena Malik: And so I think to that end, that's a problem. And because it's so accessible, I think we need to have conversations. I think it needs to be open, we have to talk about sex. And that's kind of why I do what I do. We have to have these conversations so people know what normal is. Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that. I do think that people need to know what normal is and what the range on normal is. Keeping the constraints that we talked about place earlier, because I do think those are universal, healthy constraints. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Andrew Huberman: Consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done, for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is, to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, et cetera mean, and behavioral, supplement, nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health. Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APO B and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. I asked whether or not imagined, pure imagination-based arousal versus visual arousal. And for some people, the sounds of people having sex is extremely arousing. If you've ever lived in a major city like New York, which I've spent summers in, lot, you hear more often than you do in areas where people are living further apart. You hear people having sex. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: It's part of the auditory landscape. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes, you're very close together. But yeah. So there's not exactly, at least to my knowledge, I don't know of the data that looks at fantasy versus visual versus auditory, but I will say that you can get habituated to certain things, and there is that data that maybe you can get habituated to watching a certain type of thing to get aroused, and then normal things do not get you aroused, right? Like you may watch pornography and then you may have difficulty getting aroused or turned on when you see your partner. You may get used to masturbating a certain way, right? So if you use certain vibratory stimulation or certain pressure sensation every single time you masturbate, you can get habituated to that, and you may not be able to replicate that during penetrative intercourse. And so I think that's really important. And I think the take-home is to try and vary what you're doing. Masturbation is a fine, healthy way of self-exploration. Again, with the caveat that as long as you're not masturbating to excess and avoiding your obligations or your family or your partners or your friends, right, like you are just masturbating for the benefits of maybe sleep improvement, mood boosting, reduction in anxiety. Those things are great. And so I think with that being said, you just want to be thoughtful about varying it up. Andrew Huberman: One of the issues with masturbation that I've talked about when I was a guest on other podcasts, mainly in the context of male masturbation and perhaps with pornography, perhaps not, is that it's pretty clear, based on the data surrounding addiction, that anytime there are big increases in dopamine without a lot of effort required to generate that dopamine, like turning on pornography on the internet versus asking someone out on a date, going out on a date. You know again, we're talking about going through the conversations and the mating ritual, that is the human mating ritual, that, of course, in the context of healthy interactions involves getting mutual consent and these kinds of things, right. That you could imagine how, without placing any moral judgment on it, without shaming anybody, you could imagine that if somebody exclusively masturbated and didn't develop the skills of courtship and building healthy sexual relationships, that pornography and or masturbation could start to create, quote, unquote, problems, right. Whereby somebody only felt comfortable in those domains. And I think that's what I'm hearing more and more about when, it seems to be young men reach out. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. And I think it's definitely the ease of access. Right. But I think that's pervasive in the young society now. Like, you don't have to actually go and find a mate. You can just go on an app and look for somebody. Right? Andrew Huberman: That's a form of finding a mate. I mean, I was weaned in the era when no smartphones or anything. Dr. Rena Malik: No, my point is, I think that we've become very connected to technology in our world, which also means that we're having less conversations. The younger generation is having less conversations and more online conversations. And I think that's a skill that needs to be developed as well and I think part of that is contributing to all this as well. Andrew Huberman: Well, one thing that I can attest to, is that I grew up in a community of mostly male friends. I have female friends, always have. Where a lot of what we learned about sex came from older, my case, guys. My sister probably learned a lot about sex from her female friends. And there was always that one guy who would just say stuff that years later I realized was incredibly misleading. Maybe even just detrimental. And I just want to remind people that when you are on Reddit or anywhere on the internet and there's people saying things with certainty, they might be that guy. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Right. Absolutely. And if I look at the long arc of those people, that guy's life, it didn't speak to tremendous success in the domain for which they were asserting such confidence. Let me put it that way. Okay. I'd like to slightly pivot to a different aspect of this conversation because it's just really critical, which is the female sexual response. This is something that does not get enough discussion. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: And there's a lot of stereotypes, Right. The stereotype that we hear about is, oh, they need more foreplay, which can be true. Some cases is not true. The stereotype is that women are more intimacy and relationship based in their sexual response. That can be true. I have female friends and have known women who also are just really interested in having sex for sex sake at times, or maybe all the time. I think, I like to think that we are past the stage of human development where the stereotypes around this are fixed. Right. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: And we hear more about this and we see more about this now. But what is the real deal around the female arousal response? And then we will talk about female orgasm response. And there, I'm just going to earmark now that anytime we say something like arousal or orgasm, there are multiple forms of that, and we will talk about the multiple forms of female orgasm. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So if you talk about the response cycle, you can go back to the research of Masters and Johnson. And so what they did, this was way back when, and they actually watched sex workers have sex. And this was, I guess, okay, back then. Andrew Huberman: Female sex workers, Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, with men. So they watched, and they took note of the steps of the female arousal or sexual response. And so the first phase is excitement. Right. And during that phase, your heart rate goes up, you're breathing a little heavier. There is this sex flush, you can see redness in areas like in the vulva, in the breast, I mean in the nipples. And then you go to... and that can last a variety of different times. You'll also start seeing some lubrication vaginally. Right. And then the plateau response is when that is kind of at its peak, and it kind of stays steady, and then you reach orgasm. And so orgasm essentially is a response of the body where you will have, again, increased sympathetic response, and you will have pelvic floor muscle contractions, which are rhythmic, about 0.8 seconds or so, you're having a rhythmic pelvic floor contraction along with the sensation of orgasm. And then you'll have your recovery period, which you talked about briefly earlier, which can have sort of a refractory time period, at which point you can no longer orgasm again, if you'd like to. Or for men, obtain another erection again for a short period of time. And that can be kind of an absolute refractory period, so where it's definitely not happening, and then a relative refractory period where you need something more novel and exciting to then again, resume that cycle again. Andrew Huberman: The Coolidge effect. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I've talked about the Coolidge effect before on this podcast. I'll just cue people to a timestamp link in the show note caption so we don't go down the path. But one thing that's really important to understand is that the Coolidge effect is present in both males and females, meaning if a male ejaculates and is of the feeling that they can't have another erection for some period of time, the presentation of a novel, I guess we should say partner, because we could be talking about homosexual relationship here, not just heterosexual. But a novel sexual partner, female or male, depending on their proclivities, can override the refractory period and they can have another erection and ejaculation. Similarly, a female will have a postorgasmic refractory period. If they are given an adequate stimulus, something arousing enough, they can experience arousal and orgasm again. And we know, based on really good pharmacology, that this is a dopamine-driven thing. The prolactin is essentially establishing the refractory period, and the dopamine is essentially overriding the refractory period. Fascinating neurochemistry there. And speaks to the incredible extent to which the brain is controlling the genitals. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, we always say in sexual medicine that the brain is the most powerful organ for sex. Not your genitals, but the brain. Because it is so powerful, and I'm not sure if we're going to touch on this later, but I'll bring it up now, there are some centrally acting medications now available for, they're FDA-approved for premenopausal women with low libido. Andrew Huberman: Oh, maybe just throw those out because the one that I'm aware of that's often used in, let's say, niche cultures is melanocyte-stimulating hormone in men, which gives people a tan, makes them erect. That melanocyte-stimulating hormone, MSH, comes from the medial pituitary, if I'm not mistaken. One of those weird regions — everyone talks about, anterior, posterior. And people are now injecting this as a peptide. It can cause priapism. I have not had that experience. I've never tried this MSH, but I'm told that if people are getting cavalier with it, they can have issues. A priapism being enduring and perhaps even final erection. Is that true? Dr. Rena Malik: So, a priapism--- Andrew Huberman: Priapism I mean, it's actually from Priapus, the Greek god who's often photographed with a really big erection. Oh, wow. We didn't hear enough about that Greek god in school. Dr. Rena Malik: Is it Roman? Roman or Greek? But anyways. Andrew Huberman: Either way. Dr. Rena Malik: It's an erection that lasts longer than four hours. And it is actually a surgical or, it's not a surgical, but it's actually an emergency. If you have an erection that lasts longer than four hours in the absence of sexual arousal, then it is important to get to an emergency room because at that point you can start developing decreased blood flow and ultimately changes to the actual tissues, scarring, fibrosis. So it's really important to actually go to the emergency room. Don't wait because you're embarrassed. Really get there and get treated. Andrew Huberman: However, if I'm not mistaken, earlier you mentioned that it is exceedingly rare that people who take Cialis/tadalafil or Viagra for erections are getting true priapism. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. And it's mostly from those injectables we talked about earlier, those intracavernosal injections. People can get priapism from those, a little bit more commonly. And so that's something we always counsel on. And also certain medications like trazodone, or if you have sickle cell anemia, those are the most common reasons that we see people coming in with priapism. Andrew Huberman: Really? Okay. I'm going to refrain from my desire to figure out that one so I don't take us down a rabbit hole here. Dr. Rena Malik: Sorry, I wanted to get back to the MSH. There is actually an FDA-approved medication called bremelanotide is the brand name. Vyleesi is the, sorry bremelanotide is a generic name, Vyleesi is the brand name, which is FDA-approved for women with low desire. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premenopausal women. Premenopausal because that's what they studied. But it is basically the same peptide. Right. So it is a melanocortin receptor agonist, and it works on the brain pathways to increase desire. It's taken as an injectable, again, just like you said, about an hour, 45 minutes before, when you want to want, you take it 45 minutes before. And it works quite effectively in increasing desire. Andrew Huberman: How long does it last? Dr. Rena Malik: About 24 hours. Some people maybe up to 48. Andrew Huberman: Has it been? I mean, I know of men using melanocyte-stimulating hormone peptides. I also really want to caution people about obtaining gray market peptides. Sorry for this insertion here, but there are a lot of peptides available without a prescription on the internet. They are almost all contaminated with something called LPS, lipolysaccharide, which is not something you want to be injecting a lot over time. That's actually how we induce an immune response in animals in the laboratory. And it is amazing to me how many websites are selling this stuff, and it arrives to you easily. You just buy it on the internet. It says not for human or animal use, and people are injecting it. And the LPS issue is something I think is potentially going to shut down that whole market at some point. But if you are interested in using a peptide, you should be obtaining it by a prescription from a quality physician. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly. And because we have bremelanotide, we can prescribe that for men as well. So sometimes we'll do it off-label for men who are having delayed ejaculation because it will help them achieve orgasm a little bit better. So, you know, this is available for premenopausal women. The other medication that's available for low libido is called flibanserin, also known as Addyi is the brand name, and that also works on serotonin. It's got kind of a mixed response, serotonin and dopaminergic areas of the brain, and essentially works as a daily medication taken before bedtime, 100 milligrams a day, that actually helps with decreasing hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Works in about 45% to 60% of patients, and you need to take it for some time. Now, both of these are brand name medications, so they are a little bit costly, and sometimes insurance doesn't cover them, but they are available, and I think very few people know about them, and I think they're really great and useful tools in the toolbox. Andrew Huberman: And these are for desire? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. They're FDA approved for what we call hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which is essentially low libido that causes distress and bother. Andrew Huberman: I don't want to take us off course about vaginal lubrication, arousal, and female orgasm, but as long as we're talking about arousal and reduced arousal, that requires treatment, I have to ask this now. Anytime we talk about arousal and libido, there's no BMI, which, by the way, the body mass index is probably not the best tool either. But there's no chart. It's not like a thermometer that says you're 98.6 plus or minus 2 degrees, you're good. If it's too high, much higher than that, you have a fever. If much lower than that, you're hypothermic. So my understanding, I don't want to say naive understanding, but my understanding is that one determines whether or not their libido is normal, high or low, largely based on some intuitive understanding of what their partner or partner's desire, whether or not they can meet those desires, and if they sort of accrue enough of a sample size, they date enough people where they have sexual interactions, they figure out over time whether or not they have a low, medium, or high sex drive. And people tend to compare to how they felt in earlier years or at different times of the year or under different psychological conditions and stress conditions, that kind of thing. But we really don't have a benchmark for this, right? I mean, we can't say that, for instance, that if people are not desiring sex or thinking about sex with blank frequency, that they have low libido. Right. It's sort of what is working or not working for you in the context of your life. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Andrew Huberman: Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Dr. Rena Malik: There's no right or wrong. Basically, what you're saying, there's no right or wrong amount of libido. There's many people who identify as asexual and they are happy with that. There are people who like to have sex once a month and they're happy with that. It really is a matter of distress. Are you bothered by it? So when we look at studies for female sexual dysfunction, using validated questionnaires like the FSFI, you can actually see that about 40% of people qualify for having sexual dysfunction. But really bother is only seen in about 12 %. And you can be bothered because you're bothered, you can be bothered because your partner is bothered, but it's really up to you. Right. Like, if you feel like there's something that you want to improve on, then that's when you go see your doctor. But there's no right or wrong answer. Right. This is very subjective and a lot of times we'll see couples who have mismatched libidos. Now, does that mean one person's right and one person is wrong? No, it's just a matter of like, well, if you want to come to a point where you agree, how do we get there? And what is your end goal? Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Later we'll talk a little bit more about chemistry, which I find infinitely fascinating, because in my life experience, I've just been struck by the fact that occasionally you have a physical interaction with someone, or sometimes it's not even physical interaction, and they are just so unbelievably arousing to you or somewhere in between, or sometimes it just sort of ain't there, or it's just not there that much, or nobody likes to talk about this, or it's there until you sleep together and then it's not there. And this is not just put on males, this is put on females. I hope she doesn't kill me for saying this. I know somebody who is a family member, who once said, sometimes you have to realize you never want to sleep with somebody again by sleeping with them. And here we're not talking about traumatic experience. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Right. Andrew Huberman: So, again, the discussion around libido, as you so aptly pointed out, engaging what is healthy levels of libido has a lot to do with what oneself desires as well as the hopes and expectations of the people that we are sexually involved with. So we'll get back to that a little bit later in the context of chemistry, because I find it so fascinating, and it's something that isn't talked about enough. But thank you for that. Let's get back to female sexual arousal response and orgasm. Dr. Rena Malik: So, physiologically, what happens to the body is it prepares for penetration. Now, that could be a penis, that could be a sex toy, that could be a digit — finger , to be more specific. So what it does is the cervix moves up and out of the way. The inner one third, two thirds of the vagina lengthens and elongates to allow for penetration, and it can actually nearly double in size of the baseline vaginal length. And so it is preparing for that. That's part of it. In some people who have painful intercourse, it's because they haven't had adequate time for arousal. And so the penis is penetrating before they've had those adaptations to occur. And also the labia open up to allow for that penetration. So these things actually happen physiologically to allow for preparation. So while some people may be aroused and get to that point quicker, some people do need a longer period of time of what, as you described, foreplay. And not everyone is the same, but I think it's important to have that discussion with your partner, and you know lubrication is one of the ways that people assess arousal, but that's not the be all end all. Some people just make a lot of lubrication, and some people don't. And certainly that changes with age and hormones. So certainly we know that after menopause, with a drop in estrogen and testosterone, you will see a decrease in lubrication. And sometimes, if people are on medications that can alter their hormonal axis, they may also see changes in lubrication after, during breastfeeding, you can see changes in lubrication, and again, they're not aroused necessarily, this is like a physiologic problem that they're having. Andrew Huberman: Can we distinguish between arousal-based lubrication, let's say sexual arousal-based lubrication? And again, folks, forgive me for being so hyper-specific in language, but there are other forms of arousal besides sexual arousal that we know from, it's not a pleasant topic from reports following sexual assault, that, you know, oftentimes the victim is demonized for having been lubricated. And they will say, well, then people will presume that somehow they wanted that interaction, and that's not true in those cases, it's clear that the lubrication occurred independent of libido type arousal. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly right. Andrew Huberman: Okay, so let's set that aside again, unpleasant topic, but one that's important to flag. Are there forms of non-libido type arousal lubrication that allow for nonpainful or even pleasureful penetration that are important to distinguish from the arousal-based lubrication? In other words, I have to imagine that women will have sex and it can be pleasureful or at least not painful, and that might relate in some way to baseline levels of lubrication. And here we've been talking about lubrication mainly in the context of arousal, you know, postmenopausal reductions in lubrication, but are there also postmenopausal reductions in baseline lubrication? Are some people's vaginas just more lubricated? I want to say at rest. It's like a scientist in me. When they're asleep, for instance, I mean, men are having erections in their sleep. Are women getting vaginal lubrications in their sleep periodically? My guess is yes. Dr. Rena Malik: Well, they're definitely getting clitoral engorgement, right? They're getting clitoral engorgement. There's been some studies on that, that they are also getting nocturnal tumescence, right? Just like men do. As far as lubrication, the data, at least from what I understand, is, like, there is a protective mechanism whereby women, when there's any sense that there may be penetration, that their body will immediately start creating lubrication, and that is protective to avoid trauma and injury. There's also baseline vaginal discharge. That's completely normal. Women will make physiologic discharge. In fact, in our examinations, when we examine, women will say normal physiologic discharge because we see it, there's always discharge, and it can be up to, like, 5 milliliters. So it's not a small amount, it can be quite a lot. Andrew Huberman: And it's menstrual cycle dependent in terms of the viscosity. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. It changes over the cycle, and it can be different in color and different in thickness, and that's completely normal. And I think that's a real problem in the feminine hygiene industry. You don't need to smell a certain way or reduce that discharge, this is, like completely normal, healthy. And you talked about chemistry, and I know there's not a ton of data on this, but there's, like, pheromones, right? There's scents that are coming from you which are actually attractive to a partner, potentially, and in whatever physiologic. I don't know, there's not a lot of ton of data on this, but there is that part of it. So there's a lot of marketing towards women that you're dirty, you should be smelling like peaches or whatever. Andrew Huberman: Really? Dr. Rena Malik: There's a lot of marketing. Andrew Huberman: Maybe this is a generational thing, but I learned early on, I think, my behavioral neuroscience courses, that vaginal lubrications were part of the arousal response for both. These were always framed in the context of heterosexual relationships. But both partners, let's just say both partners, because this could be a homosexual female relationship, too. Right. We want to make the conversation as broad as possible, and that the odor, let's just be frank here, the odor and the taste played a role in both arousal, but also the pair bonding response that would establish future arousal. And anyone that's ever been in a relationship that, let's say, had healthy sexual relations, I like to think has experienced remembering somebody's smell or thinking about somebody's smell, and that itself could be very arousing. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Andrew Huberman: Partners even smelling different articles of each other's clothing and that being arousing. So, I mean, this is the stuff of real physiology. We're not making this stuff up. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. But there is. There is a lot of marketing towards women that they should use douching or other things to clean themselves, and it's damaging. Right. It's actually, one it can affect the vaginal microbiome. So their pH is changing, and that can affect their risk for UTIs or bacterial vaginosis. And so they're buying these, spending their money on these things because they're being told that they're not clean. And they come to the doctor saying, oh, I think I have an STD, but it's like normal physiologic discharge. And so I think it's important to say that this is normal, and it's normal to have an odor that is distinct to you, and that there's, of course, if you have, like, a fishy odor, that may be a sign of, like, a very strong, new, novel odor that wasn't there before, that may be a sign of a sexually transmitted infection. But if it's your general odor that you've always had, that's normal. Andrew Huberman: And what about other infections, like yeast infections or bacterial infections? I got a number of questions about mycoplasma infections, which we don't hear that often about. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So you can see if your discharge has changed and become more like cottage cheese like. Or there's other symptoms, like itching or discomfort, then those are signs to go get evaluated. Mycoplasma is another infection that we see in the vagina, but we also actually sometimes see in the urine. And while it's not something we routinely test for, when we have people who have symptoms of urinary tract infection and they're not improving, sometimes we will check for mycoplasma that could be causing symptoms in the urethra itself. Andrew Huberman: We've had a couple episodes about the gut microbiome. My colleague Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford, his laboratory is directly above from mine, is an expert in the gut microbiome. I've done a couple episodes about this, and he reminded me, and I like to remind people, that every mucosal lining of your body has a robust microbiome. So that means intranasal, intravaginal, intraurethral in males and females, there's an anal microbiome. There's a microbiome on your skin, on your eyes. And you mentioned douching and other ways of, I don't want to say quote, unquote, cleaning it. Because that language falls in line with the idea that it's a good thing. You're telling me it's a bad thing in many cases, because it's wiping out the microbiome. What are some of the things that females can do in order to promote the health of their vaginal microbiome? Dr. Rena Malik: So, it's really, our bodies are amazing. The vagina is a self-cleaning oven. You don't have to do anything. You just wash. Andrew Huberman: I love that. The vagina is a self-cleaning oven. I'm not going to repeat that too often in too many different contexts, but I'm going to remember it forever. Dr. Rena Malik: You will. You will. And so all you need to do is wash the hair-bearing areas, because those are the ones that create sweat and should be cleaned. But other than that, let soapy water run down. You don't need to do anything. Your body will take care of it itself. Andrew Huberman: When I was five years old, I pulled my parents in the bathroom and I said, they still talk about this? I said, I want to know everything about sex. I want to know everything. And they were like, oh, my God, what are we dealing with? And I'll never forget, my dad just looked at me, he's Argentinian and he said, just remember, kids are the one thing in life you can't give back. That's all he said. That was it. Dr. Rena Malik: That's it. Andrew Huberman: That was it. Dr. Rena Malik: Oh, gosh. Well, I will tell you, my discussions with my sons are, my son, my older son has been much more graphic than that. I tell him--- Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Well, I went out into the world and, anyway. Dr. Rena Malik: You figured it out. Andrew Huberman: Let's spend a few minutes or more talking about female orgasm. One of the more cryptic topics on the internet, not because it isn't discussed, but because I think that the nuance of it isn't discussed often enough or in full depth. So let's take the time we need to parse this. I think that the simplest way to parse it is going to be, from the anatomical standpoint, clitoral orgasm versus so called G-spot, or penetration-based orgasm. But of course, penetration-based orgasm is also a bit of a misnomer because there can be clitoral stimulation by pelvic pressure or by digit. We're talking about fingers as digits, because we're both in the medical science profession, but we're talking about fingers here or something else. Right. Vibrator, toy, whatever. Toe, for it, depends on how flexible you are. I don't know. But the point being that I think the simplest way to go about this is going to be to talk about the distinction between clitoral orgasm and G-spot orgasm, however those are achieved, and to also talk about this idea of graded versus absolute. Okay, so this has actual parallels to neuroscience, where we talk about communication between neurons being graded. Meaning it's kind of one level, then a higher level, then a lower level, or all or none. Right? How shall I say this? It is clear in my life experience and observation that there are multiple kinds of female orgasm. Those that are graded and in some cases cumulative, they sort of build towards a larger and larger orgasm. And then there are what some people have described as cliff-type orgasms, where there's a refractory period. I think that's a fair way to frame this. And clearly, there are different responses to the orgasm response. Some people get sleepy, some people get energized. Some people, it heightens their desire for more. Some people, they need a period of time in which they become hypersensitive to touch. So lots of different things going on there. Psychologically, physiologically. Yeah, tell us all of it. Dr. Rena Malik: So, in terms of orgasm, right, I think it's important to distinguish that there is orgasm and then there's different areas that you stimulate to achieve orgasm. So some people will stimulate... The clitoris is probably the most reliable form of stimulation that will achieve orgasm. And when you look at the data, and again, female sexual dysfunction data is not super robust, but what we find is that about 85% of women require clitoral stimulation in order to climax. So very few actually climax through just vaginal penetration alone. This is a real problem we're seeing on the media that you have sex and you penetrate, and immediately women are having orgasms. That's not the reality for a lot of women, and in terms of stimulation, so like we've talked about throughout this podcast, the clitoris is the homologue of the penis, or the penis is the homologue of the clitoris, however you want to say it. Andrew Huberman: Good on you for getting it both directions. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I probably would have screwed that one up. Dr. Rena Malik: So clitoral stimulation is just like penile stimulation — for women that is very reliable. And there's a huge orgasm gap. For men, it's pretty consistent that when they have a first-time sexual encounter, 95% of men are having an orgasm. When you look at first-time sexual encounters for women, with, in heterosexual relationships, it's about 45 % to 50% are having an orgasm. And when you look at homosexual relationships of women, it's again 90%. So there's clearly some lacking in--- Andrew Huberman: Ninety percent of female homosexual interactions that are first-time interactions, 90% are having orgasm. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Andrew Huberman: Presumably because they understand the anatomy of other by way of understanding the anatomy of self. Dr. Rena Malik: So there's a huge gap. Andrew Huberman: And physiology and psychology of that, too. Dr. Rena Malik: But you know there's a huge gap there. And so I think to bring it home is that clitoral stimulation is the most reliable way. And as you mentioned, when you're stimulating vaginally, you're often, the clitoris is like a wishbone, and it goes around the vagina. And so you're often stimulating the crura is what we call the legs, I guess, for lack of a better term, of the clitoris. And so you're stimulating that. You're also stimulating the clitoral shaft, which goes deep into the pelvis. The G-spot is an area, it's an erogenous zone where it's kind of in the anterior wall of the vagina, about 2 to 3 cm in. That's the location of these periurethral glands called the Skene's glands. And they are analogous or homologous to the male prostate. So just like some men have prostate play and enjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation, some women enjoy G-spot stimulation. Now, that's not universal, right? Not all men enjoy prostate play, and not all women are going to be aroused by G-spot stimulation. And so I think there's a huge variety of ways you can stimulate anyone. It can be man or woman. Some people will have orgasms through just nipple stimulation alone. Some will just hear something or see something and be able to achieve an orgasm. And it's so varied from person to person. And I think that the big take-home from this for people listening is like, you have to talk to your partner. And this is the hardest thing, we never learned how to talk about sex. Like, what do you like? What do you not like? And don't take it personally. Right. I think a lot of times people feel like you have to orgasm to have pleasure, which may not be the case for everybody. And if it is, how do you prioritize that for your relationship? So, I don't know if I got off track there, but that's kind of, I think the take-homes for this and also the vaginal penetration. It's actually usually from cervical stimulation, not necessarily vaginal, because the large density of innervation of the vagina is in the first outer third of the vagina. The deeper two-thirds of the vagina has much less innervation. Andrew Huberman: And yet there is such a thing as cervical orgasm. And the cervix being further up the vaginal canal is cervical orgasm. Specifically, the foci of an orgasm that starts in the back of the vagina. Is that. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. So it's from stimulation of the cervix through whatever means. Right. And that can be pleasurable and lead to orgasm. And again, orgasm is defined differently, but the one thing we know is that there are pelvic floor contractions, which are measurable. So you can kind of tell that your partner is having an orgasm if you have a female partner, because you can actually feel those contractions. Right. Whether it's on your digit or your organ or a sex toy. Andrew Huberman: Okay, super nerdy question here. Years ago, when I worked on hormone-based sexual differentiation, which, by the way, we've done an episode of the podcast on previously, I learned that the levator ani muscle is the muscle that controls erection in males, and presumably clitoral tumescence and engorgement in females. Is there an equivalent muscle responsible for the orgasm response? Or is the contraction of the pelvic floor part of a more general theme of muscular contraction and a bunch of different nerve roots contracting. The reason I ask this is that eventually, in this conversation, we're going to migrate up toward the brain. But because this is a science and health podcast, when we talk about orgasm, of course many people recognize that as their experience of it and their recognition of it in other people and descriptions, et cetera. But are we talking about a response that originates at a foci, kind of like in the brain? We talk about a seizure starting at a focus, a foci, and then spreading out? Or are we talking about a bunch of different nerve roots and brain centers firing in synchrony and that's why some people experience it as behind their forehead and in their genitals. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Or as a whole-body response. And here we're not talking about the flood of neurochemicals into the body, I'm talking about during those moments of orgasm. What is happening neurally? I mean, it does have certain parallels to seizure, right? Dr. Rena Malik: It does. It does. So let me go back to your first part of the question, which was about orgasm and, sorry, erection and tumescence being related to levator ani. So actually, what happens during... the reason you get an erection, and presumably clitoral stimulation the same way, is blood flows into the erectile tissue and the tunica, which is the outer layers of the erectile tissue, which are two basically cylindrical-shaped structures in the penis and in the clitoris. They will fill with blood, and then that tunica will compress veins on the outside to prevent blood flow from leaving. So it's not a muscular event, it's an actual blood flow event. Andrew Huberman: Then how come when we wanted to study erection behavior in rodents, we would give them injections of testosterone, females or males, and observe changes in sexual behavior accordingly? Erection and clitoral tumescence. Although it's harder to measure in rodents, there's a way of indirectly measuring that. And then we would measure the size and weight of the levitor ani muscles as a readout of how androgenized that whole system was. Dr. Rena Malik: So the muscles--- Andrew Huberman: In other words, what is the role of the levator ani in the sexual response? Dr. Rena Malik: So the levator ani--- Andrew Huberman: Well, you would know. Dr. Rena Malik: So those muscles are part of the pelvic floor, right? And so those contract when you climax. Right. So whether it's orgasm for male or female, they're contracting and they're exercising. Right? So that's how they would increase their strength or their density, if you're measuring that through the actual climax, of which you can't see in rodents. Right? So, like, you're kind of using it as a surrogate in that way. So that's what happens. Those muscles contract as a response, and climax is a brain-initiated event. Orgasm is a brain-initiated event. So that's why, to answer your second part, you obviously feel focal response, but you also can feel a variety of responses because it's all coming from the brain. It's not kind of the way you described it as, like a ripple effect. It's more of like, it's the way your body responds to that particular stimuli. And it's actually like the ultimate form of mindfulness. You can't think of anything else when you're orgasming. Right. So it's like you have this moment of clarity and everything. You are very present in that moment. And so people will feel different stimulations depending on how their nerves are, their sensations are, and things like that. Andrew Huberman: It's perhaps a good time to mention dopamine. We've talked about it a few times earlier when talking about the arousal arc that starts with parasympathetic sort of calm and then move, typically starts as calm and then moves to the orgasm response. We know that the orgasm response is associated with release of dopamine and then prolactin, which sets up the relative or absolute refractory period. The interesting thing, and I got some questions about this, is that there's literature, as I understand, about the elevation in dopamine caused by, say, antidepressants like Wellbutrin, bupropion, which increases dopamine and norepinephrine. People who recreationally use drugs like cocaine or other stimulants, people who take Adderall, Vyvanse, or other drugs that increase levels of dopamine. Because I did whole episode about those drugs, and they are different forms of amphetamine, unless we're talking about Ritalin, which is a little bit different. And I got a lot of questions about people who experience feeling a lot of desire, sort of arousal, but not being able to achieve the physical arousal, erection or vaginal lubrication. So it's almost as if they're sitting further along that arousal arc. Hence the importance, I think, of people learning to have calm states of mind when going into sexual interactions. Now, I realize that in saying that, it might be confusing, because a lot of people think, well, that's anything but calm, right? Sexual arousal is anything but calm, but maintaining enough calm that they can ride that arc for whatever duration is appropriate for that interaction in them. Right. Because, again, and we should probably get back to this, some people will have sex for long periods of time, some for shorter periods of time. And here, people don't really know what other people are doing, except by way of pornography and self-report and discussion. So is it the case that drugs that increase dopamine can inhibit the sexual response? Do they tend to promote the sexual response? Because I also mentioned earlier, there's this growing trend of people taking, by way of prescription, of course, from a physician, combined apomorphine, which is a dopaminergic drug, with tadalafil, which is a PDE5 inhibitor, so it's going to increase blood flow. And I'm hearing about men and women, but mainly men doing this. So ramping up their dopamine, ramping up their blood flow to their genitals in order to have, presumably, more arousal and sex. Does that make sense as a mechanism? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. So in terms of apomorphine, that has been studied, and it's mostly been approved outside of the United States. So we don't use it very often here in the United States because it hasn't been FDA approved. But it's a very complex response. So, like I mentioned, that flibanserin, which is a centrally acting medication, it actually has not only stimulatory but also inhibitory effects on dopamine. So the way it sort of works to enhance interest or libido is sort of complex and kind of confusing. When it was actually approved, it was being studied for an antidepressant, and what they found was that women were actually having better interest in sex or more interest in sex. And so that's kind of how it was discovered. Similarly, Viagra was actually studied for high blood pressure. And when they went to, it was horrible blood pressure medication, but then the men who took it actually didn't return the samples for the study, so they realized, like, what's going on here? And it was because they were having better erections. Andrew Huberman: Is it true that at some urology meeting that the first description of Viagra as a treatment for erectile dysfunction involved the speaker actually coming out from behind the podium and revealing his erection? Is that a true story? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. I don't think it was Viagra. I think it was an intracavernosal injection, though. I think he came out, it is a true story, there's actually a published article, I'll send it to you so you can share it if you'd like. Andrew Huberman: I'm not sure I want to see it, but I'll read the article. Dr. Rena Malik: There's a published article about people who were attending at the meeting. And, yes, he came out, and at the time, it was mostly men in urology, but there were, like, spouses, I guess, in the audience, which is not typical now. So there were women in the audience, and he came out with a full-on erection to show that it worked. Andrew Huberman: Well, I suppose at the Urology meeting or OB-GYN meeting, where a woman comes out and reveals her enhanced vaginal lubrication, then we will have gender and sex balance at the meetings on urology. It'll be interesting to attend one of those someday. Differences in arousal as a function of stage of the menstrual cycle. Really interested in this. I did a long episode on fertility and we're going to have a few other IVF experts, fertility experts on the podcast. But, clearly, there are differences in hormones across the menstrual cycle. We know that for sure. Clearly there can be psychological variation according to those hormones for probably other things across the menstrual cycle. And it's always an imperfect experiment because we aren't laboratory rats and people are having different interactions across the menstrual cycle. Is there any known correlation between desire and stage of the menstrual cycle? There are some obvious assumptions that one might make: prior to ovulation, et cetera, around the time of ovulation. But what about the other direction, too? Is there a category of women that are very interested in sex at certain stages of their menstrual cycle and then not at all interested in sex at other stages of the menstrual cycle? Dr. Rena Malik: You know, all, the data that I've heard, and maybe a gynecologist could speak more on this because they study those variations a little better. But there is data to suggest that libido does increase prior to ovulation and during ovulation, I think it's like a couple of days prior, because that's the optimal time for fertility. So, yes, there is data to suggest that. In terms of completely lack of interest, I don't believe there's data, but I'm not sure. Andrew Huberman: Is there evidence that females who perhaps have not experienced so called G-spot orgasm or cervical orgasm can learn to do that? And I always find it interesting that whenever there's a discussion about different forms of female orgasm, people are careful to point out that many women don't have penetration-based orgasm, and then they separate out clitoral stimulation as a more common route to orgasm. But of course, there can be clitoral stimulation with penetration. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: Right. And depending on the physical arrangement, there can be clitoral stimulation purely by way of penetration through pelvic contact, fingers, et cetera. How should we think about this? How should we talk about it? Dr. Rena Malik: So there was an interesting study that I just read recently where they gave women words for these things, right? So there's like the rocking stimulation. So that can also stimulate. So, meaning that you're penetrating, but there's like a rocking motion that can also penetrate the clitoris. There's stimulation of just the outer part of the vagina, which, again, as I mentioned, the G-spot is there, it's more highly innervated, so that can be more stimulating. There's also ways to align yourself so that when you're penetrating, you're putting pressure on the clitoris, and then there's stimulation with actual stimulation of the clitoris, like intentional stimulation either by yourself or by the partner. And so there are multiple different ways to do that. Right. And so I think that it's important to really kind of, it's okay to explore and not always be a home run. And I think that's like when you get into a relationship where you're maybe second, third, fourth time having intercourse with someone, that you can try and explore these different things or if the partner themselves knows what they like to actually tell the other partner. Right. There's a huge part of communication that I think plays a huge role in this because we know ourselves better than anyone else. So you can tell your partner what you like. And I think that we have never been taught how to do that. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Such important conversations for so many reasons. And as you point out, definitely not something they teach people in school, except they might say something about communication is important. And that almost always circles back to the key four things we talked about earlier, which is that consent and age-appropriate , context-appropriate, these kinds of things. And obviously, substances like alcohol and other drugs can strongly confound those issues, and so we'll just leave that as a kind of an obvious one. As long as we're talking about communication around sexual interactions, perhaps it would be useful to people to cultivate a language or a nomenclature there, too, to facilitate that. Some of the language that I've heard that is quite useful is things like people have different arousal templates. Some people, certain ideas are stimulating to them and other ideas are aversive to them. And then there's this category in between, where sometimes people sort of either don't know because they haven't tried it or haven't thought about it, or they're sort of curious but kind of unsure. Or it might work in the right context, but maybe not all the time. So is there any kind of structure that's been put out there as a way to improve communication around sexual interaction? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, I mean, there's no like script, but I think, in general, you want to have the conversation outside of the bedroom. So not like right before sex or right after sex, because that leads to a sense of insecurity for the other person. Right. Did I do something wrong? Did something go wrong here? So you want to kind of move those to a neutral location. So, like kitchen table, in the car, whatever, somewhere where sex is not going to happen, at least for that particular moment. Andrew Huberman: For folks listening, some challenging conversations on this podcast. Previously challenging because you're trying to get things clear and as clear as possible. This one's challenging because there's so many caveats to everything. Right? Of course people have sex in cars, right? Or they did when I was growing up, and sometimes they still do. Okay, please continue. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. So that's one, and then two, when you're discussing it, I mean, this kind of goes for any difficult conversation is like you make "I" statements, right? You say, I like it when this, I don't like it with this, it's not something you did, right? It's not, you didn't do this, you didn't do that. It makes kind of an animosity sort of situation. And then I think also part of it is like being open about those things and it's not going to happen in one conversation. I think that's the hard part. Like, you think you're going to have a conversation, it's going to go great, and things are going to be better. It's going to be like multiple conversations, and some of them are not going to go well. Right? So that's another place where you can actually get the help of a sex therapist. And there is a website for that. It's A-A-S-E-C-T, aasect.org, where you can look for a sex therapist near you, and you can even do those things virtually. And so that can be really helpful when you're having difficulty having a conversation. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I think, again, such important conversations. And then when people differ in terms of their level of experience, it gets potentially problematic, but also it can be potentially educational. And then, of course, there are the twists and turns that occur with when one is asking about somebody else's arousal template. Oftentimes you'll learn things about people's sexual past, and that can be either neutral, stimulating, or aversive. Right. That can open up all sorts of other issues related to the psychological interplay. So there's no way we can parse all of those now. I just think it's worth highlighting that it's understandable why those conversations are challenging, and it also is understanding why pornography isn't going to involve those conversations. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Right. Andrew Huberman: The only conversations there are between your brain, your hands, and your eyes and your ears. Not going to highlight any particular order there. I want to switch gears slightly and talk about UTIs. I got a lot of questions about urinary tract infections. Let's make it related to both females and males, because, yes, males get urinary tract infections, females get them. More females asked about urinary tract infections, how common are they? Should they always be treated with antibiotics. Is cranberry really a good treatment? If so, why? Are there other things that are better as it relates to the acidity or alkalinity? How does one prevent getting UTIs? Can you get them from swimming? Should you urinate after sex? Tell us about UTIs and how not to get them and how to get rid of them. Dr. Rena Malik: Happy to. So UTIs are very common in women. Probably up to 50% of women get at least one UTI in their lifetime, and up to a third of them get recurrent UTIs. And what that means is they have two or more in six months or three or more in a year. Now, this is common, and so we'll see a lot of it. And it's not as, until you're having recurrent UTIs, say you just have one a year or you have one every few years, it's not a huge issue. In men, however, UTIs are much less common, and that's because the urethra is longer, so there's less entry from the outside world into the bladder, which causes infections. And so when men get a UTI, it's concerning. Why is a man getting a UTI? There's multiple reasons that it could happen, but it should be investigated so that you can make sure there's no anatomic abnormality or functional abnormality with the bladder that's causing the UTIs. In terms of prevention, there are kind of major things that are highlighted in the guidelines that we all talk about. So one is hydration. So making sure you're drinking about two to three liters of fluid, ideally water, a day, because dilution is the solution to the pollution. Right. So drinking more fluids is going to get that bacteria and you're going to pee it out. It's going to help keep, not let it sit around in the bladder very often. Another thing in women who have altered states of estrogen, whether it's postmenopausal, surgical menopause, or maybe have reduced estrogen for postpartum or other reasons... Andrew Huberman: What about during the second half of the menstrual cycle? Dr. Rena Malik: Not necessarily for those specific people, but for those specific times, because it's pretty short-lived, I guess you could use it. But is vaginal estrogen. So vaginal estrogen, meaning estrogen that's applied in the vagina either through a cream, a suppository, or a ring, is highly effective in reducing the occurrence of recurrent UTIs. And this is because when you have low estrogen, the pH in the vagina goes up and the pH in the vagina goes up because there's less conversion of glycogen to lactobacilli, and then those lactobacilli are preventative for UTIs. So essentially, you want to reduce the pH back to its normal acidic pH. And vaginal estrogen is very effective at doing that. In fact, in our clinics, we'll actually check a vaginal pH to see if there is an indication that their pH is too high, that maybe they do need vaginal estrogen, particularly around like, perimenopause, because it's hard to tell just by looking if they are really heading into a lower estrogen state sometimes. And so that's very, very effective and very, very safe. So when you look at estrogen, the Women's Health Initiative, way back when, sort of made a big stink about how estrogen is related to cancer. However, vaginal estrogen has never, ever been a reported breast cancer, uterine cancer, or any other blood clot, any other adverse event associated with vaginal estrogen. You can get some breast tenderness, some discharge, those things can occur, but the absorbed amount vaginally is so little that your estrogen level barely goes up. It doesn't even reach premenopausal levels. So it just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream, not enough to create any sort of abnormality. So vaginal estrogen is extremely safe, and it's pretty affordable. You could actually use coupons if your insurance doesn't cover it, through GoodRx or Mark Cuban's pharmacy, and get it very affordably. And it's very effective. It does take about three months to work, so you have to be consistent. You apply it about twice a week at night, sometimes three times a week, and it's very effective. The ring you put in once and it lasts for three months. So generally speaking, that's the most effective option for low estrogen states. Other kind of simple things are trying to make sure you're completely emptying your bladder. So over a lifetime, people can develop some mild pelvic floor dysfunction, right? Not enough to create pain or discomfort, but maybe they're not emptying completely, right? Because maybe they used to hold their urine for long periods of time when they were a kid, or maybe they're always hovering over the toilet because they don't want to sit on it at work. And over time, that can create a little bit of mild dysfunction, which can make it more difficult to completely empty the bladder. And when urine is sitting in the bladder for long periods of time, it's basically food for bacteria to grow. And so bacteria grows. And then you get recurrent UTIs. So making sure you completely empty by sitting, relaxing on the toilet, sometimes leaning forward and then maybe going a second time. So standing up, sitting back down, going again. And even for men, sometimes trying to sit and see if you completely empty because sometimes standing you're not able to empty completely. Andrew Huberman: Whoa. A lot of men are going to... because it was fun to research for this episode because there are entire discussions on Reddit about what percentage of males sit while urinating. I mean, my understanding, based on having visited many male bathrooms in my lifetime and just being in the world that I assumed that men stood up in order to urinate. But there are a decent percentage of men that sit down to urinate. Dr. Rena Malik: There are. And in fact, it's variable by country. And probably the reason it's become more interesting lately is the media. Andrew Huberman: By country? Dr. Rena Malik: So a certain country was recently surveyed, I think it was Germany, but essentially this recent picked up by the media that Germans sit more often to pee. And so then people are like, oh, is this better for me to sit to pee or stand to pee? And there was this whole big discussion on the media. But the reason being is when you're sitting, your pelvic floor is most relaxed. And so if you're having any issues emptying your bladder, you're going to pee better. Also if you have an enlarged prostate, which I'm sure we're going to talk about prostate enlargement, that can sometimes allow you to develop a little bit more intra-abdominal pressure because you're sitting and you can lean forward to overcome sort of a blockage. And so there are some indications where sitting is better, but if you're peeing fine and you're standing, that's fine too. I don't think you have to. I think it's just something that in other countries they do more and here we don't. And I don't think it's right or wrong. It just depends on your individual circumstance. Andrew Huberman: Can spermicides or condoms or both increase the frequency of UTIs for females? Dr. Rena Malik: So spermicides, absolutely. So spermicides, if your condom has spermicide on it or you're using spermicides, that is a known risk factor for UTIs. Other things I want to touch on, you did ask about cranberry. So cranberry is actually in the American Urological Association guidelines for prevention of recurrent UTIs in women. Now how does cranberry work? Right. Like, do I just drink juice? It's actually a specific active ingredient in the cranberry, which is called proanthocyanidins, or PACs. And they've actually looked at the amount of PACs you need and what formulation. So you need 36 milligrams of PACs in a soluble form. So a lot of the supplements on the market will say that they're 36 milligrams of PACs, but they're like the whole berry. So they're using the skin of the berry and the stem of the berry, and that's not going to help you. So you need to make sure that the supplement you're using is a soluble form of the cranberry. And it's actually very effective at reducing the risk of UTIs. Andrew Huberman: So do you mean capsules, like a gel cap? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, it's a capsule that you take once a day. And there is some, although not as much, data that if you're having them around sex, which some women do always have postcoital UTIs, that you can take two on the day of sex and two on the day after, and that may be helpful, but there's not a lot of data there, but certainly an option that you can try that's pretty low risk. So that's kind of the guidelines. Now, there's a ton of other things that you can do to help prevent that are kind of available and have some data behind them. So D-mannose is one of them. Where you take about 2 grams a day of D-mannose and you drink it, and that actually helps reduce UTI risk. It's been studied in a small, randomized, controlled trial to be effective. So those are kind of the bigger ones. There's other things that people use, like probiotics, but there's a lot of heterogeneity, as you know, in probiotics and what to take. And are they really effective vaginally in the flora there? So those are kind of the big things. And there is actually a lot of microbiome study in UTIs going on, actually at UCLA, where they're looking at the microbiome of people who are more at risk for UTIs or even overactive bladder, other conditions like that. And they're trying to figure out, is there something here that we can target or that we can figure out is causing problems? Because sometimes we just can't figure out why it's happening. In terms of wiping from front to back, and swimming, and peeing after sex, there's no good data on any of those things. Wiping from front to back, I think it does create a little bit of shame. Like it's not a big deal if you wipe back to front as long as you've cleaned yourself, so to speak. So I think it's less of an issue. Andrew Huberman: What we're talking about is, you're referring to any contamination from anal. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. Andrew Huberman: Any bacteria around the anus? Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. And a lot of women who have recurrent UTIs tend to come and feel very dirty, like there's something wrong with them. They're like, oh, I wash all the time, I'm really clean, I'm really this, and it's not something they're doing. It's probably a microbiome effect or a hormonal effect, or there's something going on that we need to investigate further. It could also be anatomical or functional problem where you're not emptying the bladder correctly. So there's lots of different factors. It could be, and it's very infrequent, I would say, like, I've never seen a patient who's dirty and that's the reason they're getting UTIs. Andrew Huberman: Perhaps even the opposite is true. They're cleaning too much, based on what you told us earlier. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: And they're eliminating the gut micro, excuse me, just rolls off the tongue again, no pun intended. Perhaps they are abolishing the local microbiome on the skin. Too much cleaning eliminates the microbiome on the skin. Not that we don't want to wash, but when Sonnenburg was a guest on this podcast, he said, actually, kids can develop a very healthy gut microbiome and general microbiome, oftentimes by, sorry parents, not washing their hands before eating. If they've been playing with soil outside or dirt, a little bit of that is actually healthy. Pets actually offer microbiome support. This is so weird, I know it sounds dirty, but we have to imagine how we evolved as a species was not with antibacterial soaps and alcohol swabs everywhere. And obviously, we don't want infections, but overcleaning can disrupt the microbiome, which presumably can lead to UTIs. So perhaps someone who's cleaning excessively is more at risk than somebody who's cleaning a little less. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. And actually, the cleaning can irritate the dermis, right. So you can actually get contact dermatitis-type symptoms from overcleaning. And so that's one of the things, we're like, I definitely have a UTI, I definitely have one. Well, no, you don't, but there's a host of other things that it could be. One of them could be that another very common one that we already touched on is pelvic floor dysfunction. So very often, pelvic floor dysfunction, just like you had pain with urination, women can also develop pain with urination that doesn't go away. And it can start where they had a UTI that triggered the pelvic floor, and then the pelvic floor just didn't relax, but the pain just triggered the pelvic floor to tense up. And it didn't relax because, again, we're not taught how to relax our pelvic floor. And then they've developed pelvic floor dysfunction. Like, why is the UTI not going away? Or why does it keep coming back? And so that's another common thing that we see in people who have, quote, unquote, recurrent UTIs but don't really have them. Andrew Huberman: To be clear, I experienced the pain in urination as a consequence of trying those damn Kegels that everyone's talking about stopping. That was informative in two directions. One, it relieved the pain very quickly, so that was good. The other was, I realized that it is possible to have a pelvic floor that's neither hypercontracted nor overrelaxed, and in some cases, just not doing anything for it is the best circumstance. Dr. Rena Malik: Right. Andrew Huberman: And the only reason I mentioned that is because, obviously, this discussion is not about my pelvic floor, this discussion is about the fact that some people perhaps need to clean less. Some people maybe more, but probably not, based on what you said. Some people might need to strengthen their pelvic floor, some people might need to relax their pelvic floor, and some people's pelvic floor is probably A-OK. I think any discussion about anything medical or especially hormone stuff, this happens a lot in the discussions around that I get into. It seems with males, every male now seems to wonder if their testosterone is too low, except the ones that are blasting testosterone, because they know it's excessively high. And as you point out earlier, at least in terms of sexual function, that's unlikely to be the case. Maybe less desire, but in terms of genital-based arousal function, probably, yeah. Dr. Rena Malik: And I mean, you've talked about testosterone a lot on the podcast, so I'm sure your audience knows very well the multitude of benefits for testosterone. So I think there is value in assessing hormone panels and assessing your level of free testosterone, testosterone, and assessing if you're having... symptoms are not always sexual. Right. It can be depression, it can be weight gain, that you're not gaining muscle mass. You can have cognitive changes. So those things can still be a sign of low testosterone and very valuable and important to assess. Andrew Huberman: That reminds me of another thing, and then we'll get back to UTIs. And I want to talk about kidney stones, but I've heard of women using a small amount of testosterone cream directly on the clitoris as a way to amplify the, maybe it's the desire and arousal effect, or perhaps just one or the other. Dr. Rena Malik: So the way that we discuss testosterone use, and there are, like, consensus statements, and there's actually an abundance of data on testosterone use, particularly in postmenopausal women, for low libido or low sexual desire. And it's all been very positive in the sense there's been increased sexual desire, based on validated questionnaires, increased number of sexually satisfying events with testosterone use. Now, the range of testosterone in women is about a tenth of the amount of testosterone a man needs. Right? So testosterone cream is systemically absorbed wherever you apply it. And so the way we generally recommend women to try this if they are having low libido, and we've ruled out other issues that may be psychologic —relationship, other issues that can affect libido, medications. There's a lot of things, obviously, that go into that. And we've checked their testosterone. It appears to be low for physiologic levels for women, which, again, is one tenth of the male level, then we can actually prescribe off-label testosterone. And the guidelines or the consensus statements are not like true guidelines, but they recommend using transdermal testosterone. So getting Androgel tubes from the pharmacy and putting a tenth of one tube on the back of the calf or the upper outer buttock, a hairless area, for absorption, that can improve desire overall. And then the other place we use testosterone is in women who have what we call vestibulodynia. So the vestibule is the area outside the vagina, which is very hormonally active. There's lots of androgen receptors there, and it can actually, when you have hormonal issues, meaning lower testosterone and estrogen in that area, it can cause pain. And so actually applying a combined or compounded estrogen-testosterone cream to that area over time can reduce that pain and discomfort. So, as you know, testosterone receptors, or androgen receptors all over the body, very much in the genitals, very much in the brain, and they're very useful to... a very useful place to treat women for those issues. Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Kidney stones. I hope to never have one. Dr. Rena Malik: I hope you don't either. Andrew Huberman: But people get them. How do you avoid getting them and how do you get rid of them? So, kidney stones, very often they can be for a variety of different metabolic disorders. Right. So it can be one, dehydration is a very common cause of it. So dehydration combined with maybe a slight metabolic abnormality where you're creating more calcium or oxalate in your urine, can result in kidney stones. And so how can you prevent them? I mean, each person is individual. If you get a kidney stone, typically we do what's called a 24-hour urine analysis plus some bloodwork to assess what is the metabolic abnormality. So we can target that either with diet or with medication. And so the kind of general recommendations for people who have kidney stones. One is increase your fluid intake to 2 to 3 liters. Again, the same number I told you before; you want to decrease your oxalate intake. Dr. Rena Malik: Now, if you Google oxalate, you're going to find a million things that you eat that have oxalate in them. But the big ones are spinach and rhubarb. We're seeing a lot of nuts, too, that are, you know, people eating a lot more nuts to get more protein. So cutting back, it's impossible to get rid of all of that in your diet. But if you're having, like, a spinach salad every day, well, switch it to a different green. Right? Don't eat spinach every day. Also, you want to increase your citrate intake. That's an inhibitor of kidney stone formation. So increasing fruits and things like that, to increase citrate vegetables as well. Actually, one easily accessible thing is Crystal Light. It has a high citrate composition, so you can drink Crystal Light with that, two to three liters. And that can be helpful. You want to decrease your protein intake. So high levels of purines or purinergic meats, like red meats and things, can also put you at higher risk. So these are kind of the general sort of preventative measures we talk about for kidney stones. If you have a kidney stone, so a lot of times, people can have kidney stones in their kidneys, they're not creating any problems, they're tiny, we can observe them over time. If they start getting very large or they are starting to move into the ureters or the tubes that drain the kidney, oftentimes they're accompanied with pain. Quite a bit of pain, and it can be very uncomfortable. In those cases if they're not having any infection symptoms, there's no signs of a urinary tract infection, there's no fevers, no chills, we can treat it conservatively with pain medication, and also there are medications like flomax, which are used for enlarged prostate as well, that actually relaxes the ureteral smooth muscle to allow the stone to pass a little bit better. If you're having an infection, you got to get it treated right away. You can get very sick very quickly. In fact, I've seen young, healthy patients, like, they're healthier than me, walk in the ER with a kidney stone, and within 24 hours, they're in the ICU because they're really sick because of a kidney stone. Andrew Huberman: Fever, urinating, tea-colored urine, meaning blood in the urine, all of those are important warning signs that you ideally don't get to. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, blood in the urine, I mean, doesn't always mean infection. It could just be irritation from the stone, but certainly fevers, chills, or you have a sign of an infection and the stone looks like it's blocking. So if you get imaging and you see what's called hydro nephrosis, or pressure behind the kidney, and you have these signs of infection, we don't want to wait because you can get sick pretty quickly. And then to treat the kidney stones, there's three major options. One is shockwaves. Another is ureteroscopy, where we go in with a camera and we have a small laser, we break it up into small pieces and--- Andrew Huberman: Where is the camera inserted? Through the urethra. Dr. Rena Malik: Correct. You're asleep under anesthesia, so you don't have to--- Andrew Huberman: You saw that--- Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, I saw---- Andrew Huberman: You saw the wince. Dr. Rena Malik: And then percutaneous nephrolithotomy, which is done if you have a large kidney stone or a very hard kidney stone that's up in the kidney, you can go in through the back with a small, like a small incision and with a specialized camera that goes in and uses ultrasonic lithotripsy to break up that stone and kind of suck it out that way. Andrew Huberman: They're extremely helpful bits of information, or not even bits. This is enormous amount of useful information. I like to pivot, again, for sake of breadth. We can't go into extreme depth on everything, but appreciate your willingness to follow this carousel with me. Oral contraception. Previously on this podcast, I hosted a female physician guest who offered both sides of female oral contraception, discussed some of the benefits, discussed some of the risks. I made the decision to post clips about both on the internet, and wow, wow, wow, was I surprised, but also, frankly, a bit shocked. And then finally intrigued by how polarized the discussion is around female oral contraception and female contraception in general. So, NuvaRing, Norplant, the pill, broad category of things there, but for sake of discussion, the pill, et cetera. I mean it seemed that approximately 50% of responses, which seemed to come mainly from women, were of the, this stuff is terrible, it ruined my life, it ruins lives, it destroys you. It has immense risk. And then the other half seemed to say, no, there's reduced risk of certain forms of cervical cancer. This has allowed me the sexual choices and lifestyle that I prefer without risk of pregnancy. I mean, it was astonishing to the point where I thought, wow, if only I could post both clips simultaneously. So obviously, I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that this is among the more polarizing topics available for discussion. So what is the story, meaning, what are the data about oral contraception? Why so much controversy? And what's the real deal here? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes, so it is a very polarizing topic. And there is abundance data, abundant data. In fact, we even did a study, and again, this is not like high-quality evidence, but we looked at Reddit threads, and we looked at sexual dysfunction, specifically low libido, orgasmic difficulties. And we read hundreds of threads and we did like a qualitative analysis to see--- Andrew Huberman: In females. --- Dr. Rena Malik: in females, to see what are people talking about and problems with oral contraceptives and antidepressants leading to low libido. And being very, as you describe, very like, this has ruined my life was very common. And so the theory is that taking oral contraceptives increases the amount of sex hormone-binding globulin, which binds testosterone and estrogen, and that actually makes testosterone less available, which is, as we've talked about, a very important hormone for desire. And so in some subset of people, they're seeing very significant consequences of taking oral contraceptives. Now, I think that we don't know which women are going to have this problem and we don't know how. It's probably a very small subset of people. But we do know that this does happen and that when you measure SHBG levels, they're up. And that even after they stop the oral contraceptives, you'll see elevated SHBG levels from baseline. Andrew Huberman: For how long? Dr. Rena Malik: You know, for like, at least four months afterwards, you'll still see elevated SHBG levels. So we don't know. Andrew Huberman: But not infinite. Dr. Rena Malik: We don't know. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, the endocrine system is weird because we assume everything is a short-term effect, but there's some plasticity in the system, especially because it's a neuroendocrine system. Dr. Rena Malik: Exactly. Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Okay. Dr. Rena Malik: So I think, yeah, there's some neuroplasticity there that occurs as well. And so we do see this. And I think that the other side of it is, yeah, absolutely, oral contraceptives are amazing, right? They're helpful for sexual freedom, for preventing pregnancy, for a lot of things, and particularly other conditions too, like PCOS and other problems. Oral contraceptives are amazing and they've changed gynecology and management of these women in a very positive way. And so I think, yes, I do think that there is oral contraceptive-related sexual dysfunction. Usually low dose estrogen sort of contraceptives are the culprit. But I think that again, the data, female sexual dysfunctional literature is just not as robust as male sexual dysfunction literature. Andrew Huberman: I saw a lot of comments about how oral contraception had led to depressive-like symptoms or just kind of ahedonia and apathy, not just lowered libido. I can imagine how that would be the case through the elevated sex hormone-binding globulin, which is preventing testosterone, estrogen from being free, literally, and exerting their effects on not just the body but the brain. But is there any evidence that oral contraception can disrupt neurotransmitters? I'm not aware of any. Dr. Rena Malik: I don't think so. Not to my knowledge. Andrew Huberman: Okay, well, it sounds to me like oral contraception for women, because that's where we normally hear about it. It sounds like there's a varied response and it's highly individual. I've certainly had partners that love the pill, or at least didn't seem to mind it. I've had some that hated it and no way tried that, never will, or just went with other forms of contraception or for whatever reason were not using contraception. So it seems to me that there's a lot of variation out there. How does one explore that without risk of permanent damage? It sounds like truly permanent damage is unlikely. What are the other options? Is, the ring, copper IUD? Dr. Rena Malik: So any sort of long-acting hormonal contraceptive we've seen, that's what we counsel patients on, is if they're having issues with oral contraceptives, even if they come in with pelvic pain and they're on oral contraceptives, I'll tell them, you know what, just stop. Because maybe the effect on the androgen receptors, or estrogen receptors is affecting the lubrication or other things, we're not sure. But why don't you stop it and go get a long-acting contraceptive method. Andrew Huberman: Like an IUD? Dr. Rena Malik: Like an IUD. Andrew Huberman: And are IUDs safe? And here we should probably say, okay, copper IUD is one form. You want to mention a few of the other forms? Dr. Rena Malik: So I don't prescribe IUDs, but generally speaking they're very safe. Of course there's risk with any sort of. You know it's a procedure, you're inserting an IUD, so there's obviously some small risks associated with it, but it is safe and effective form of contraception. Andrew Huberman: If people are wondering why the copper IUD is an effective form of contraception, copper is like the third rail for sperm, as I understand it. So much so that I was able to find some evidence for this in the medical textbooks, that in the old days, as I say, prostitutes who wanted to avoid pregnancy would put copper pennies in their vagina. Dr. Rena Malik: Really? Andrew Huberman: Now, I don't recommend that to anyone, and please, and I don't think it's a foolproof form of contraception, but there is evidence that that did happen. So, which is amazing. That means that people somehow figured out the copper-sperm relationship, which isn't a good one for the sperm, and deduced from that a behavior. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, that's, that's--- Andrew Huberman: Rena's cringing. [ Dr. Rena Malik: LAUGHING] Andrew Huberman: I am not suggesting people do that. I think it's just an interesting medical factoid. I can tell you want to move on from this topic, so we will. Before discussing prostate and anal sex, not stated next to one another for any particular reason, I want to talk about SSRIs. A lot of people over the last 20, 30 years have been prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that have disrupted their sexual function, or their sexual desire, seems in particular. Do you see a lot of this in your clinic? Do you hear about it? What can people do about it? Oftentimes these sexual arousal or dysfunction issues associated with SSRIs and other medications make those medications prohibitive for people. Dr. Rena Malik: So, you know, serotonin is kind of the anti to orgasm. And so, in fact, we will use SSRIs off-label for people who are having premature ejaculation. So it delays ejaculation, and then there's also other sexual dysfunctions we see with it. And it does happen, absolutely. It's dose dependent. So in some cases, when someone comes in with SSRI-related dysfunction, if they're doing well, you can either try to reduce the dose or switch them to another antidepressant, for example, Wellbutrin, that does not have such severe effects on sexual function. And so you can also use like Cialis and Viagra, like what we've talked about for erectile dysfunction as an addition if we can't change their medication management. Because you know, this gets a little bit complicated because we know erectile dysfunction and depression are very interrelated. Now, what's causing what? And where do we, maybe somebody went to see their doctor for depression, but was also having issue with erections, and now, if you fix the erections, do you help with the depression? You know what I mean? Andrew Huberman: Males everywhere are shouting yes. Dr. Rena Malik: So I think that there's a lot of discussion that has to be had there. It's a lot easier to talk to your primary care doctor about depression than it is about your erections. And so I think it's important to really dig into that a little bit. But, yes, it is definitely a known thing. We use it to our advantage when needed, and it can be helpful to switch medications or reduce the dose. Andrew Huberman: You mentioned earlier that trazodone can cause sustained erection. And is trazodone in the category of touching the serotonin transmission system? Dr. Rena Malik: I don't remember the mechanism, but interestingly, trazodone is also used for off-label, like as a third or fourth line for premature ejaculation as well. So, I don't remember the mechanism offhand. Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about prostate and prostate health. Earlier, I queued up that there's a growing trend toward, I would say, more progressive male physicians — or physicians who treat males. Excuse me. Dr. Rena Malik: Thanks for that. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Prescribing low dose 2.5 to 5 milligram Cialis, which is tadalafil, which may assist with erections. But the rationale for this low dose, daily low dose is not centered around erections per se, it's really about prostate health. Improving blood flow to the prostate, reducing prostitis, maybe even reducing the probability of prostate cancer. What other sorts of things are you encouraging men to think about when thinking about their prostate? Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. So, before I forget, I want to mention that low-dose tadalafil is actually a treatment for erectile dysfunction. In fact, it works quite well, particularly in men who are having a lot of psychogenic issues. One, because they don't have to remember to take a pill before sex, it's always on board. And you're taking 5 milligrams every day and it has a 36 hours half-life, so you're kind of increasing those. So it can actually work quite well and is a great option for erectile dysfunction. So I do want to make that caveat. In terms of prostate health, it has been shown to be effective for BPH, or enlarged prostate, and this is a very common condition. In fact, if you look at autopsy studies, 80% of men at 80 have an enlarged prostate, like it's very, very common now. Does everyone get symptoms, and what's the long-term concerns of it and what can you do about it? So, typically, as the prostate enlarges, it's right around the urethra. It's a walnut-shaped gland sits underneath the bladder around the urethra, and it can narrow the urethra or the P-tube. And so over time, you can imagine, like, if you're, I always give this example, if you're sucking from a straw, right? You're drinking from a straw. If you have a wide diameter straw, it's really easy to drink. If your straw gets really narrow, like, say you take a coffee straw and you drink out of that, it's very difficult to drink. Very similarly, it can become very difficult to urinate if you have an enlarged prostate. Now, what causes an enlarged prostate? There's a whole host of factors. A lot of them are genetic. So if your father or your grandfather had a large prostate, you're probably more likely to have an enlarged prostate. Do we know exactly how to prevent that? Not exactly, but we know how to mediate the symptoms a little bit. So the other symptoms you'll see before you have difficulty urinating is sometimes you'll see overactivity. So you'll see your bladder is responding to having to push hard against that narrow urethra to push urine out. So it's having more urgency, like the sudden desire to go to the bathroom that you can't delay. You're maybe going more frequently, and very often, you're going more often at night. And so those are kind of the first signs people will see. And then over time, it may become more and more difficult to empty the bladder. You might see some hesitancy, like, you're waiting for your stream to start, or it stops and starts, or you're just like, I can't empty. It's not because it just drips or a very weak stream. And so those are kind of the things that can happen over a lifetime. Now, what are some things that you can do to help? Cialis helps relax the fiber, the smooth muscle of the prostate, so that it allows urine to pass more easily. There's also other medications that you can treat very often, Flomax or other alpha blockers are helpful in that area. In terms of things that you can do in general for bladder health, prostate health, there are certain things that are irritants to that area. And so what I tell people, not everyone's affected the same way, so I don't want people to be like, oh, I got to stop all these delicious things I eat and drink, but certainly it can be useful to just pay attention. So, like, if, say, you drink coffee every day and you find yourself running to the bathroom a lot. If you limit your caffeine intake, you might see that you're not going to the bathroom quite as often because caffeine is a bladder irritant. So that can be coffee, tea, chocolate, things of that nature that have caffeine in them; energy drinks — sometimes people forget they have caffeine in them. And so limiting, that may improve your symptoms. Alcohol also is a bladder irritant, and these have actually been studied in animal models. And you'll see that the bladder contracts more often when they're given these sorts of substances. And it's dose dependent. And some people can actually habituate or get used to a certain dose of caffeine, so if you're drinking coffee every day, you may have less symptoms than someone who drinks it every once in a while. Other things can be sometimes carbonated beverages, spicy foods or acidic foods. Those sorts of things can also irritate the bladder lining. So sometimes limiting those things may be helpful in those situations. Andrew Huberman: Thank you so much. That's very informative. Years ago, there was a discussion about bicycle seats causing damage to the prostate, maybe even sexual dysfunction. Is that still a thing? I thought they put grooves into the seats, but I've also, in reading on the internet, I didn't do a deep dive on Reddit, but seems that women are reporting some bladder incontinence from excessive bicycle seat use, maybe even exercise bike. It doesn't have to be road bike. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, so this is a great point. So cycling, if you think about it, right, you're sitting on your perineum, which is that space for men between the scrotum and the anus — for women, between the vagina and the anus. And right there runs your pudendal artery and your pudendal nerve, which are again, responsible for blood flow and nerve function to the area. So the most common things we see in people who are really high-volume cyclers, now, the studies have looked at, like, maybe they did a 350-kilometer race or they're biking three times a week for 60 minutes, but there's no consistency. But they're seeing pretty high rates of genital numbness. So, like up to 50%. And also in men, erectile dysfunction. In women, you'll also see numbness, but because sensation is a big part of arousal, you'll also see kind of decreased lubrication, maybe decreased arousal as well in women. And so how can you prevent that? The reason is because when you're sitting, particularly if you're leaning forward like competitive bikers do, or aero riding, you're putting pressure on the beak of the bicycle seat. And that's where most of the, your weight is not distributed evenly. So the goal is to take a bike seat that allows you to sit comfortably on your ischial tuberosities, and posture is a huge part of your pelvic floor. I know we didn't talk about that earlier, but sitting with good posture and not kind of slouching or leaning forward can actually really do wonders for your pelvic floor. So focusing on posture is helpful, but also when biking, posture is helpful. So they've actually looked at this data and they found that people who aero ride, meaning lean forward, or people who use narrow bike seats, are more likely to have issues. And so you want to get kind of a noseless seat and a wider seat. The cutouts, actually, when they've looked at kind of mechanics of the cutouts, they'll see higher pressure around the opening. So it's actually not good to have a bike with a cutout, bike seat with a cutout, because they've seen, at least with some of the cutouts, that the pressure actually becomes higher on the area that's right around it. Andrew Huberman: Very important point. I don't cycle. I don't like the exercise bike. I'll sometimes ride the assault bike, which has the big seat, for a few minutes. Dr. Rena Malik: But I just want to add one thing, because I don't want to make people not cycle. I think it's really valuable, cycling is a great aerobic exercise, has lots of benefit for cardiovascular health. But there was actually another study that looked at people who were parts of sports clubs, so they were like swimmers, runners and cyclists, and they looked at rates of dysfunction and they found that actually the rate of erectile dysfunction was not different between runners, swimmers and cyclers. So maybe because those other studies were just looking at cyclers, that maybe it's just the general rate of erectile dysfunction in that population at that point in time. So the numbness is definitely an issue, the erectile dysfunction, maybe, maybe not. Andrew Huberman: So I just have a couple of more questions for you, and by the way, you've been incredibly generous with your time and information here. Dr. Rena Malik: Thank you. Thank you. Andrew Huberman: So I really appreciate it, as I'm sure our listeners do as well. Anal sex. You recently did a post describing the multiple reasons why women do or do not have anal sex. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. Andrew Huberman: Very interesting post, very interesting study that you covered, and you explained it very clearly. I'm guessing there are relatively few, but perhaps some other studies as well. About this. Let's talk about anal sex, and maybe if you could just offer some of the key bullet points that you've learned from the literature and from your clinical practice. How frequent is it? With protection, without protection? How safe is it? What are the different reasons people do it? That might seem like a kind of a silly question, but it turns out when it comes to this topic, there are interesting data. Educate us. Dr. Rena Malik: So, anal sex. Let's talk about it. Well, when you talk about anal sex, the reason people, it's become more and more common. Let's say, it's, more and more heterosexual couples are doing it. We know that male homosexual couples are having anal sex. And I think the one thing is that it's safe in terms of pregnancy. Right. You're not going to get pregnant from anal sex, which is one of the reasons people do engage in anal sex. Andrew Huberman: Do you think that's the reason people are doing it more frequently? Dr. Rena Malik: No, I think that's one of the reasons that people, one of the reasons people do. But in general, the issue with anal sex is that people forget to use protection, like a condom, for example, because sexually transmitted infections are actually more likely with anal sex than they are with vaginal penetrative intercourse. Because the anal tissue is very thin and friable. So when you penetrate the anus, particularly if you have any trauma, you can have blood loss, and that blood loss can then easily, more easily transmit sexually transmitted infection. So it's really important to use a condom and use adequate lubrication. The anus does not make any of its endogenous lubrication, you have to use lubricant. The other interesting thing about anal sex is that the anus pH is different from the vaginal pH. So you want to use specific lubricants that are iso-osmolar to anal pH. So you can actually look up anal lubricants. And we could talk about lubricants, but generally there's water-based, silicone-based, oil-based lubricants. Water-based are the most easily accessible, silicone-based, are a little more slippery and last a little longer, and oil-based also last longer, but are not good for use with condoms. So definitely using lubricants and always kind of making sure to be in the context, of course, of being consensual, but also never force, always take your time. And those things are really important to avoid trauma because trauma can happen. And usually it's not severe trauma. Right. It's not going to create long-lasting problems, but it is inconvenient, uncomfortable, and probably we're not seeing as much of it because they're not coming to the emergency room if they're having issues, unless it's really serious. So I think it's really important, one, to prevent from sexually transmitted infections. Two, to be thoughtful and cautious. And sometimes it requires some preparation. If you're going to penetrate an anus, you're not going to start with a large girth item, you're going to start with something smaller and kind of work your way up. And then I think ultimately, why people have anal sex, so, as I mentioned earlier, the prostate is highly innervated and can be a source of pleasure, so some people enjoy that. Particularly men may enjoy anal penetration. Women as well may enjoy anal penetration because of the innervation around there, the pelvic floor. That's certainly reasonable to do so. As far as why people engage in anal sex. So sometimes it's because, as I mentioned, they're trying to avoid vaginal penetration, either to avoid pregnancy or maybe menstruation or other reasons. Sometimes it's because people want to do something special with their partner. Like, they feel like this is my special thing with this partner that I do with them. And so it may be something kind of like a gift or something like that. Sometimes it's almost like they feel like they have to. And this particular study that I looked at, there's actually not a lot of studies on why people engage in anal sex. And this particular study that I had talked about on my channel or on my Instagram was talking about why they specifically recruit drug users. And so a lot of people had used drugs prior to engaging in anal sex. And I think that that's not ideal. You always want to be kind of in the right state of mind for consent and safety purposes. And so those were kind of the common reasons. Andrew Huberman: What about infection not related to sexually transmitted infection? My presumption is there is a higher risk with anal sex than there is with other vaginal intercourse, oral sex, et cetera. But is there evidence for that? Dr. Rena Malik: Not necessarily. It's more about sexually transmitted infections more than anything else. The rare things that people have kind of commented on, like anal incontinence temporarily or things like that, very rare. Mostly it's just sexually transmitted infections because it's more easy to create bleeding through anal sex if you're not careful. Andrew Huberman: And are people doing enemas before anal sex to prevent bacterial infection, or is that just like it's a kind of... Dr. Rena Malik: Some people are, some people are not. I think people are making sure they're evacuated fully. There's some media articles about what you should eat before to kind of keep your gut healthy and avoid kind of loose stools and things like that. But generally speaking, there's lots of things you can look up to make it safe and healthy again. Andrew Huberman: I'm sure some people are listening to this and maybe they've turned it off already, and I think we can expect a varied response to this discussion, but it's happening out there. Dr. Rena Malik: It's happening. Andrew Huberman: Apparently with an increasing frequency. Dr. Rena Malik: Yes. And I don't know if that's because of the increasing availability of pornography where it's visualized more, or if I don't really know why, but we do know that there's more going on in heterosexual couples than prior. Andrew Huberman: As a final category of question, I was really interested in some of the posts you've done about herbs and supplements in the context of sexual desire and sexual function on this podcast. I always say, always, always always, we emphasize behavioral tools first, dos and don'ts, right, because those are the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance in all contexts. There is of course a role for prescription drugs, sometimes. Oftentimes people can't do the things and avoid the certain things they want to because of depressive states, anxious states, et cetera, and prescription drugs can serve a role. But I do believe the goal is always behaviors first. Then of course things like adequate sleep, nutrition, healthy social interaction, all of that stuff, exercise. But we do often talk about supplements because they represent, I think, an important category of over-the-counter compounds that can play a role. And I've talked before about Tongkat Ali, this Indonesian herb, I think it can be Malaysian as well. But this Indonesian herb is typically the one that I am aware works best for mild libido enhancement. Sometimes, especially in the case of people taking SSRIs, it can enhance libido to override some of the challenges with SSRI-induced reduction in libido. And generally, even if people aren't under SSRIs, I hear from people who take Tongkat Ali and get libido increases. Also things like Maca root, which we don't really know how these things work exactly. Probably some freeing up of testosterone with Tongkat Ali, maybe some cortisol suppression as well, maybe some estrogen receptor modulation with Maca root, maybe some dopaminergic tone changes. Shilajit, this ayurvedic herb, which there is at least one study that I think is done well that shows increases in FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone with Shilajit use. What are your thoughts on things like Tongkat Ali, Maca root? Shilajit, how do you talk to your patients about this stuff? Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, so I think that I see at least my patient population is still in the behavioral management place, right. The biggest cause of sexual dysfunction, whether it's low testosterone, erectile dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is often comorbidities. Right? So managing high blood pressure, managing diabetes with diet, which you talk about a lot, but the best studied diet is the Mediterranean diet, at least in the sexual dysfunction literature. Exercise, like, doing both cardiovascular aerobic exercise, but also doing resistance training, particularly of large muscle groups, and then really working on reducing blood pressure and preventing diabetes. And those things, I think are really key. And I know you talk about them a lot on this podcast, but I will tell you that when people are getting ready for, for example, we do a surgery for erectile dysfunction called penile prosthesis. So this is like, end of the line, nothing's working, they can't get an erection at all. And they may have diabetes as a cause of it. And when we say you have to get your hemoglobin A1C below a certain level to do surgery, I cannot tell you how quickly these men change their behaviors. Andrew Huberman: For sake of erection. Dr. Rena Malik: For sake of erections. So I think that really, if I can say one thing before you do supplements, which I don't have a problem with, I think that it's reasonable to try them. I would try one at a time to see what's working, so you're not taking a bunch of things and not knowing what exactly is working and realizing that they're not going to work immediately. If you take something that works immediately, it's probably got a PDE5 inhibitor mixed in there. And so it's going to kind of build over time, and you're going to see changes over time. But I would say that the number one thing that I recommend for people is improving their diet, exercising, getting good sleep. As you know, it boosts testosterone. And even you mention this all the time about getting early morning light, but it's beneficial for testosterone as well, because you're helping release testosterone with the circadian biology. So I think that those things I can't stress enough, like, how valuable they are. And if you're smoking, quit smoking, it will kill your erection. Andrew Huberman: And vaping. Dr. Rena Malik: And vaping. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Dr. Rena Malik: And then lastly, if you are developing true organic impotence, meaning that there's a biologic problem that's causing your sexual dysfunction, then it's really important to get your cardiovascular health assessed, because about 15% of men who develop erectile dysfunction seven years later will have a cardiovascular event. It is the canary in the coal mine, meaning that it's the sign that you may be developing cardiovascular problems or like endothelial dysfunction that's first presenting in the penis or in their sexual organs. And this probably is the same for women, we just don't have the data yet. Andrew Huberman: I know a good number of women that take Tongkat Ali, in part, I think, on the recommendation, although I want to be clear, I never recommended it. It was an offer of something that people could try if they're doing everything else correctly and could assess with consulting your physician, of course. And they too, some of them have reported improvements in libido and desire as well. Dr. Rena Malik: Well, that makes sense. Andrew Huberman: Shilajit is less known about the distinguishing quality versus low quality sources of Shilajit is harder. Dosing is harder. It comes as this tar typically. Maybe more science on Shilajit will come out in the next few years. We could get behind it a bit more. Right now I'm sort of on the, yeah, maybe if you are an adventurer, you might try it, but it's not one that I normally throw to the top of the list. Dr. Rena Malik: Yeah, I think that, like L-citrulline is pretty good. Ashwagandha for stress reduction, which also has implications for sexual function. Tongkat Ali has reasonable data. I think there is reasonable data on these things, I think the website you talk about all the time, examine.com, is a great place to look at that. And like I said, I think it's reasonable. They're smaller studies, there is bias in many studies, but there is effort done in this area, and there's never going to be really high-quality science. No one's going to really fund that, I think. So I think our expectations need to be a little tempered when it comes to that stuff. Andrew Huberman: Well, Rena, Dr. Malik, I want to thank you ever so much for this discussion today. You provide us so much useful information and really have transcended the divide between the mysterious thing that everyone wants to know about sex and sexual health, genitals and genital health, prostate, urethra, UTIs, all these topics that many people are just afraid to raise and to confront directly. And you've taught us so much about how to promote the health of this incredibly important system. Dr. Rena Malik: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: One thing we know for sure, either in vivo or in a dish, we're all here because a sperm and an egg. And of course, there are other reasons why people engage in sexual activity that have nothing to do with reproduction, but surely it is core to our biology and our psychology and well-being. So thank you so much. And also thank you for the work you do day in and day out, week in and week out in your clinic, we will provide links to your clinic. People are interested in working with you directly as well as online. That's how I initially found you. And when I did, I was just absolutely delighted. I thought, finally there's somebody who's providing the kind of information that everybody wants in a thoughtful, logical, clear and respectful way. So on behalf of all the listeners and viewers, and on behalf of myself, I just want to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you for what you do, and please keep going and please come back. Dr. Rena Malik: Thank you so much. And honestly, the work you do is phenomenal. It's an honor to be here. Thank you so much.

Title: Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-08-07 12:00:31 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing ketamine ketamine is a fascinating compound and it's one that nowadays is being used both clinically for the treatment of depression and suicidality and PTSD and it is also drug that is commonly abused that is ketamine is often used recreationally and it has a high potential for abuse so today we are going to discuss both the research on the clinical benefits of ketamine as well as the risks of ketamine we are going to discuss the mechanisms of action by which ketamine produces what are called dissociative States I will Define for you what a so-called khole is in scientific terms I will talk about dosages of ketamine I will talk about delivery routes of ketamine and throughout I will be emphasizing both the clinical benefits and the risks that is the potential harms of using ketamine out of the appropriate clinical context so by the end of today's episode you will understand thoroughly what ketamine is how it works in the brain and body to produce dissociative States and to relieve depression and you will understand how it can actually change neural circuitry this is an important thing to understand about ketamine the acute or immediate effects of ketamine while one is under the influence of ketamine are just part of the story of how ketamine modifies the brain for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD and by extension when people use ketamine recreationally there are those immediate acute effects of ketamine but there are also long-term changes in the brain that are important to understand during today's discussion we will also be talking a lot about neuroplasticity or your nervous system's ability to change in response to experience and we will be talking about neuroplasticity not just in the context of ketamine but as a general theme for how your nervous system changes anytime you learn anything and in that discussion you're going to hear a lot about bdnf or brain derived neutrophic Factor brain derived neutrophic factor is a critical molecule for all forms of learning and memory and changes to your nervous system so in addition to learning about ketamine and how it works clinically and its relevance to recreational use and abuse you will also learn a lot about neuroplasticity and bdnf and what it's doing in your brain right now as you learn before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roka Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind I've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly when for instance you go from a shady area to a sunny area when you look at something up close or off in the distance Roa understands all of that and have designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that regardless of conditions you always see with perfect clarity their glasses are also extremely lightweight and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty in fact initially Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for use in sports things like running and cycling Etc and they still can be used for that but really their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed to be worn anytime I wear readers at night or when I drive at night and I'll sometimes wear sunglasses in the middle of the day although of course I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight exposure which everyone should be doing to set their circadian rhythm if you'd like to try Roa eyeglasses or sunglasses simply go to Roa that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the

before on this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're sleeping well and enough all of those things are improved and when we are not sleeping well or enough all of those things mental health physical health and performance all get worse now a key component to getting a great night's sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment has to be such that your body temperature drops by 1 to 3° in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and that your body temperature increased by about 1 to 3 degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed with eights Sleep mattress covers you can customize the temperature of your sleeping environment such that you always get the best possible night sleep I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for about 2 years now and I must say it has vastly improved my sleep if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman and save $150 off off

heard of ketamine but most people don't realize that ketamine is very similar to another drug called PCP or Fen cycline which goes by the street names angel dust or Sherm it has some other street names as well when I was growing up I heard a lot about PCP they taught us about it in school you'd hear about it on you know cop shows on television and the lore was that PCP would eliminate people's perception of pain and would make them violent you know you'd hear these stories in drug education classes that when people are on PCP they're punching light poles and breaking their hands you know they can fight off eight or 10 police officers who are trying to handcuff them I don't know whether or not any of that is true or not but we heard a lot about PCP and it was associated with drugs of abuse things like cocaine methamphetamine it was lumped into that category nowadays when we hear about ketamine rarely do people mention that ketamine and PCP actually have the same mode of action more or less okay I'm not talking about the specifics I'm talking broadly they have the same mode of action in the brain that both of them are dissociative anesthetics and nowadays usually when we hear about ketamine we are hearing about its benefits we are hearing that it can help cure depression we are hearing that it can help reduce or cure suicidality that it can used to treat PTSD and indeed all of that is true in the appropriate clinical context at the appropriate dosages and given at the appropriate frequency ketamine has proven to be a miraculous drug for some people not all people for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD that said ketamine also has a very high potential for abuse and so it may come as no surprise that we often hear about ketamine nowadays also in the context of its use at parties you hear about people going into so-called koles which is a particular State associated with overdoing the dosage of ketamine a little or a lot we'll get back to that a little bit later what it is how dangerous it is Etc in any case ketamine is an incredible drug very similar to PCP Fen cycline and it is a drug that nowadays there is crossover between the clinical uses of ketamine for treatment of depression Etc and its recreational use what do I mean by that what I'm referring refering to is people accessing ketamine legally for the purpose of treating depression but taking that ketamine out of the clinic out of the doctor's office which is a very different set of conditions than most of the studies that have been done on ketamine and its role in depression and not surprisingly if there is increased access to a drug like ketamine really any drug that has a potential for abuse then we also see an increase in the number of people that are using that drug recreationally and some of them do indeed get addicted to ketamine so I know many of you are probably wondering can you get addicted to ketamine indeed people can get addicted to ketamine there are some people who like its effects enough that they find themselves compelled to use ketamine even though the use of ketamine is degrading their overall life performance so work school relationships finances Etc that said ketamine does have these established clinical uses so nowadays the landscape around ketamine is oh so different than it was 10 or 20 years ago when it was lumped very close most ly with PCP Fen cycline and really just looked at as a drug of abuse there were some early cases in the 1970s of the use of ketamine in order to treat PTSD this was mainly in soldiers in Vietnam or people coming back from Vietnam but really the clinical use of ketamine for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD has really just taken off in the last 5 to 10 years and that's what's brought us to this new landscape of interest and understanding and use of ketamine in the clinical and recreational context so how is it that a drug that at one time was really just viewed as a street drug that was bad bad bad is now being prescribed widely and has all this interest surrounding it and really this has to do with our understanding of what depression is and what depression isn't so I'd like to just take one or two minutes and explain to you a little bit about the history of depression and its treatment what we observed starting about the middle of the last century so around 1950 but really taking off in the early 1980s and '90s is the so-called monoamine hypothesis of depression monoamines as the name suggests are synthesized from amino acids that's a good way to remember monoamines monoamines include things like serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine although there are other monoamines as well monoamines are neurotransmitters or more specifically they are neuromodulators meaning they change the activity of neural circuits in the brain and body they can ramp up levels of activity in lots of different brain areas or they can reduce the activity of neural circuits in lots of different brain areas as well as within the body right your gut has serotonin and needs serotonin dopamine also plays important roles in the body etc etc the monoamine hypothesis of depression is really centered around the idea that it is deficiencies in these monoamines either serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine or some combination of those that gives rise to depression now in reality there is very little if any evidence that there is a deficiency of monoamines in any form of depression however it is very clear that drugs that increase certain monoamines so drugs like Prozac or zolof that increase serotonin or drugs like Bryon which is often called Wellbutrin which is its commercial name which increases dopamine and norepinephrine can often provide relief for certain symptoms of depression in some people however what we've learned over the last 30 or 40 years is that drugs that are designed to increase certain monoamines in order to treat depression only work in about 40% of depressed people that take them and they have a lot of side effects now some people are lucky enough that they can use a low enough dose or perhaps even a high enough dose that gives them relief from their depressive symptoms but does not give them side effects that make it so uncomfortable for them to use that drug that they would choose rather to not take that drug however a lot of people that do get depression relief from things like Zoloft or paxel or from Bryon find that the side effects which include things like dry mouth although more commonly reductions or increases in appetite or vast reductions in libido or changes in their sleep patterns Etc that those side effects really make it impossible or at least very uncomfortable for them to take those drugs and of course there are the 60% of depressed people who do not respond to those drugs at all now I want to be very clear things like ssris things like Wellbutrin have helped a tremendous number of people get relief from depressive symptoms and in many cases have warded off suicidality as well however there are also a great number of people who have experienced a lot of side effects and problems from these drugs hence the desire to find other compounds that can treat depression without creating similar side effect profiles and that ideally can provide relief not just for 40% but for all people suffer uffing from depression so that's where ketamine enters the picture prior to the 1990s they were mainly studied in neuroscience and pharmacology Laboratories for their abuse properties and for their anesthetic properties so ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic it's actually used to induce certain forms of anesthesia for surgery it's not always used but it's often used this is something that if you've ever had a surgery you might want to ask your anesthesiologist about you know what sorts of drugs are you giving me to go under sorts of drugs are you keeping me to stay under and maybe even what sorts of drugs are you giving me to bring me out of anesthesia because it turns out that when you go into anesthesia your anesthesiologists is rarely giving you just one drug typically they're giving you one drug to you know kill off a little bit of anxiety and maybe eliminate a little bit of pain sometimes and then they'll give you another drug to drop you into a deeper plane of anesthesia and then nowadays there are sophisticated ways to monitor your plane of anesthesia and there are sophisticated ways to if necessary get you out of a deep plane of anesthesia if that plane of anesthesia is too deep when I talk about a plane of anesthesia I'm just talking about going from Full wakefulness to you know a reduction in anxiety to falling asleep to asleep to the point where even if someone were to pinch your toe or your arm like a really intense pinch that you wouldn't wake up from that okay so ketamine has the property of being an anesthetic it kills the response to pain and at certain does it can bring you into deep Plains of anesthesia at lesser dosages it can take you into transition points between awake and deeply anesthetized and it's really that transition point between awake and deeply anesthetized which we are going to call the dissociative State it's kind of this Lial State a little bit like dreaming it can have some dreamlike qualities to it that's the state that has most often been sought after or employed for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD which brings up a really important point which is that when people use ketamine recreationally it's not clear exactly what plane of anesthesia or dissoci ation they are actually seeking and this is why we hear about some of the desired effects of ketamine that are driving people to use it recreationally and why we also hear about people having some unpleasant or even very unpleasant or dangerous experiences when using ketamine recreationally because we're talking about a drug that has a lot of different effects depending on the dosages and as we'll soon talk about individuals vary tremendously in their response to different dosages of ketamine and the delivery route for ketamine whether or not it's delivered orally in the form of a pill or put sublingually in what's called a troch that dissolves under the tongue or it's injected whether not it's injected into the vein or intramuscularly Etc each of those can produce very different effects in terms of the speed of onset of the drug and the type of effects that it produces in the brain and body so what happened in the early '90s is that Laboratories that were studying animal models what we call preclinical models of things like depression and learning and memory and to some extent ketamine but mainly focusing on learning and memory and depression made an interesting Discovery there's a certain preclinical model of depression that's pretty common in Laboratories that involves taking a rat or a mouse and putting it into a small container like it looks like a beaker or a jar sometimes it's a tray and it has water in it and you might be surprised to learn perhaps not that if you put a rat or a mouse into water it will swim okay so it's treading water in order to keep its head above water and not drown I realize for some of you this might a bit of an aversive topic to hear about animal research but this is one of the common preclinical models of depression which is put a r a mouse into water let it swim and see at what point it gives up because what happens is if you put a rat or Mouse into water it will attempt to save its own life by swimming but at some point it will just give up and it will just start sinking and then of course the researcher needs to rescue the r Mouse put it back into its home cage dry it off give it some food Etc this preclinical model is called the model of learn helplessness and it's become a prominent pre-clinical model of depression because of course we can't ask mice or rats if they are depressed or happy I I suppose you can ask them but they're not going to answer in any kind of meaningful way so we can only look at their behavior in order to understand whether or not they have a sense of happiness or a sense of depression and of course that's very hard to gauge in an animal model of any kind you could make guesses based on other behaviors like are they grooming regularly are they eating regularly you know things that more or less parallel what we think of as health or lack of Health in a human who's happy or depressed but in the context of trying to understand depression in these preclinical animal models having a behavior that you can really quantify carefully across a lot of different animals and conditions is really beneficial so this thing of putting a rat or Mouse into water and seeing how long it takes before they give up to save their own life is called the model of learned helplessness and what it allowed researchers to do was to take rats and mice put them into water see how long it took before they gave up and then to give them different drugs to see whether or not any of those drugs either hastened sped up or prolonged the duration over which the animal would attempt to save its own life this actually has some meaningful parallels to human depression you know one of the Hallmarks of depression is that people stop thinking positively about their future depression of course can include a lot of other symptoms you know one of the most prominent symptoms of depression for instance is consistently waking up around 2:30 or 3:30 in the morning and not being able to fall back asleep again now keep in mind it is not the case that if you're waking up at 2:30 or 3:30 in the morning and you can't fall back asleep that you are absolutely depressed that's simply not the case but that pattern of lack of sleep plus some other things like lack of anticipation of a positive future inability to imagine the future in any kind of meaningful or positive way Etc are part of the key features of what we call a major depressive episode so this preclinical model of learned helplessness allowed researchers to test a lot of different drugs and establish which drugs at which dosages allowed animals to fight for their life longer when placed into water it's really that simple as a model but it revealed some very interesting things at least one of which is that when animals were injected with ketamine this dissociative anesthetic but they were injected with dosages of ketamine that were below what would induce full anesthesia these animals would swim for their life for a lot longer now to some extent that ought to be surprising and in fact was surprising to researchers because ketamine is what's called an nmda receptor blocker now when I say blocker I'm not getting into the details of what specific form of blocker it is but I do want to mention that a blocker is sometimes referred to as an antagonist whereas something that promotes the activity of a receptor is called an Agonist okay so if you can just remember that ketamine is an nmda receptor antagonist or blocker then you should be fine for the rest of today's conversation now I haven't told you what nmda is nmda stands for nmethod D aspartate and you do not need to remember that but the surprise for researchers was that this drug ketamine is allowing animals to fight for their life for longer so it has this sort of property of overcoming what we call learned helplessness or a sense of helplessness AKA anti-depressant effects and we also know that it's an nmda receptor antagonist or blocker and that's perplexing because we also know that the nmda receptor is critical for changing neural circuitry in the brain it's critical for neuroplasticity so put differently here's a drug that blocks the receptor that's critical for neuroplasticity for changes in the brain and yet somehow it's allowing these animals to fight for their life longer it's somehow giving them more of a sense of hope at least that's the subjective interpretation of what one observes when a mouse or rat is swimming for much longer when it would otherwise just give up and sink to the bottom of the vessel now in general there are two kinds of scientists there are scientists that take a look at a set of findings like that and say oh here's a drug that's supposed to be terrible for us it's an anesthetic and it blocks nmda receptors and nmda receptors are good for neuroplastic icity and somehow it's also allowing these animals to swim longer and I would say one category of scientists would just look at that and just say wow that is a big ball or tangle of confused facts like how does one even reconcile that right brain change ought to be good and perhaps even lie at the heart of our ability to recover from depression this is a drug that blocks neuroplasticity but somehow is relieving depression I'm G to walk away from that I'm going to work on something far simpler and then there's this other category of scientist which thank goodness exists who looks at that apparent contradiction of okay there's a drug which blocks plasticity plasticity is thought to be important for getting over depression and yet the drug can provide some relief from depression at least in these preclinical animal models and they say hm I like a good puzzle right the more complex the puzzle the more interesting and they start digging in with preclinical studies and they start talking to clinicians who are treating patients for depression and like I said thank goodness these sorts of scientists exist and thank goodness they did that because it turned out that when clinicians tried ketamine in depressed patients as a means to relieve depression it had remarkable effects so it was about the year 2000 when the first sets of papers about the clinical use of ketamine for the treatment of Depression started to emerge now we have to remember the context in which all of this was happening you know in 2000 drugs like Prozac and some of similar ssris selective serotonin uptake Inhibitors things like Wellbutrin were really hitting the market in full force and as we talked about earlier some people were getting relief some people were getting relief with a lot of side effects and therefore deciding not to take those drugs and a lot of people the majority of people that were taking those drugs were not getting relief so there was a real urgent need to find other drugs for the treatment of depression and ketamine at least based on its apparent profile of being a dissoci of anesthetic would seem like the last drug that you'd want to use to treat depression right it dissociates people we even hear about dissociation as a symptom of depression and yet what happened was a small number of very pioneering clinicians started to explore the use of ketamine in the clinic for the treatment of depression and in particular for depression that did not respond to any other treatment so there was a real critical need to find other compounds and a bit more motivation to test some of these let's call them atypical compounds for the treatment of depression so one of the first Landmark papers in the use of ketamine for the treatment of depression is entitled anti-depressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients this is a paper that I provided a link to in the show note captions it's a small study okay so it doesn't involve many subjects at all really just has seven subjects all of whom had major depression and they did intravenous injections with half a milligram per kilogram of body weight of ketamine now that dosage half a milligram per kilogram of body weight turns out to be very important for today's discussion because it's going to serve as a reference point for later discussions when we get into other modes of delivery of ketamine such as oral pill form ketamine or sublingual ketamine and as it relates to things like the khole or the dissoci of State or the various effects that ketamine can have depending on the dosage and the delivery route meanwhile going back to this study what they found is that when they injected patients with severe depression with ketamine the effects of ketamine took place within minutes within 10 or 15 minutes and that they experienced a sort of Peak euphoric State okay so they're not inducing deep anesthesia right at this dosage they're getting people into a kind of euphoric dreamy semi- dissociative state that occurred within 15 minutes and really peaked about 45 minutes to an hour after they were injected with the drug and that the total effects of the drug in terms of euphoria were effectively over by about 2 hours or so and that time course of effects makes perfect sense if you look at say the halflife of ketamine which is how long it takes for half of the drug to be active in the system Etc but what was really interesting about this study and others like it is that the patients experienced relief from their depression almost immediately after taking the drug So within minutes to hours and that it persisted for several days after taking the ketamine okay so the dissociative euphoric dreamlike effects of ketamine take place very quickly they're very very Salient right the person basically basically is just lying there experiencing this euphoric dreamlike dissociative State and they get some relief from their depression immediately and yet there's persistent relief from that depression which lasted at least 3 days out from the treatment now a key theme of today's discussion is going to be that the anti-depressant effects of ketamine appear to be fairly short-lived at least when one is exploring one or two treatments with ketamine in other words the typical Contour is that people will take ketamine get this euphoric dreamlike dissociative effect come out of that feeling some immediate relief from their depression this is one of the things that makes ketamine an incredibly attractive drug for the treatment of depression especially depression that hasn't responded to other forms of treatment which is that people get relief very very quickly indeed the same day that they initiate the treatment now this is especially important when you think about the fact that the monoamine hypothesis of depression which drove the discovery and development of all the drugs like ssris w Butrin etc those drugs often can provide support for people with depression again only 40% of people get true relief from their depression and again there are some side effect issues or major side effect issues in some cases that have to be dealt with but even the positive effects even under the best conditions oftentimes those effects don't kick in for weeks or months after somebody initiates taking the drug now that might not seem like a long time to wait for some of you but if you are somebody suffering from from depression even another day even another hour with depression seems almost unmanageable and sadly many people who have these forms of depression will go on to commit suicide so it is ever so important that there be rapid treatments for depression even sameed day treatments for depression and based on this study it appeared that ketamine was and indeed Still Remains that drug now I certainly don't want to position ketamine in your mind as a miracle drug for depression in fact I don't actually believe in Miracle drugs I don't think that there is any compound that alone can produce all the desired effects that one wants without any negative effects in a way that could warrant calling it a miracle drug that's just not how biology works there's always an interplay between pharmacology between our behaviors and what we choose to do or not do this is a topic we'll get into a little bit later when we talk about anti-depressive behaviors and the role of ketamine in bringing about anti-depressive behaviors for the relief of depression now with that said the study that I just mentioned as well as many many other studies that followed emphasized that ketamine could provide significant decreases in not just depression and suicidality but also the feelings of helplessness and worthlessness that are associated with major depression and again it could do that in people that also were not responding to other forms of depression treatment such as ssris Etc so while we don't want to call it a miracle drug ketamine turned out to be and remains an incredible drug for the treatment of depression in certain cases now in addition to that ketamine has been shown in clinical studies to provide relief not just for treatment resistant depression of the major depression type right there's many different forms of depression but major depression is the one that we're normally thinking about or referring to when we talk about depression but ketamine has also been shown to be effective in treating bipolar depression sometimes called bipolar disorder although more commonly nowadays called bipolar depression I did an entire episode by the way on bipolar depression if you want to know what it is and what it isn't how it differs from borderline personality disorder Etc you can go to hubman lab.com just put into the search function bipolar and it will take you to that episode ketamine has also been shown to be useful for the treatment of PTSD and for OCD obsessive compulsive disorder and for anxiety and for various forms of substance addiction so ketamine is not a miracle drug but it does seem to have broad application and to be very successful for the treatment of a lot of major psychiatric challenges now just because ketamine has shown these incredible applications it also has some serious problems that are directly related to how it works in the brain or at least from what we understand of how it works in the brain and what I'm referring to here is yes ketamine is very rapid acting it can often provide relief from depression almost immediately meaning same day however it is very shortlived after about 3 days or a week or so the anti antidepressant effects of ketamine often wear off so that creates a situation where people perhaps need to take ketamine every week and yet it creates enough of a dissociative State meaning it takes people enough out of their normal daily routine that the prospect of people taking ketamine every week is actually not that feasible and also because of some of the propensity for ketamine to become a drug of abuse that is for it to be habit forming and or addicting one also worries that if people are doing ketamine every week to treat their depression that they can become so-called hooked on ketamine now fortunately there have been studies of ketamine and how it works not just in the short term but in the longer term that have led to some very important clinical studies that have explored for instance people taking ketamine twice per week for a duration of three weeks total and what they find is that yes after the first time they take it they get some relief from depression they take it a second time that week they get some relief from depression and they do the same thing the next week and the next next week and when they do that they get relief from depression the whole way through that entire three weeks but it turns out that there's also some so-call durability to the effect such that if people do this twice a week dosing regimen so ketamine twice a week for three weeks total they find that when they end that 3 weeks they get some ongoing relief from their depressive symptoms which can extend months or more before they have to repeat the twice a week for 3 weeks regimen now certainly not all studies of using ketamine for the treatment of depression have used that exact dosage regimen twice a week for 3 weeks then take some time off repeat twice a week for three weeks take some time off repeat some have explored giving ketamine once per week or even three times per week or doing it once a week for five weeks and then taking an extended period of time off before repeating the treatment schedule there are a bunch of different studies out there but when one looks at all of those studies and mass together it's very clear that ketamine is providing relief from depress symptoms immediately and in the days after the treatment but that when those treatments are stacked fairly closely together that there is some durability some ongoing relief from depression and what this tells us is very important in fact I hope everybody really highlight this in their minds as they're hearing it it's very likely that ketamine is acting by at least two and probably three different mechanisms in order to provide relief from depression one of those mechanisms induces relief from depression very quickly and seems to be associated with that euphoric dissociative dreamlike state that one experiences when they are under the influence of ketamine the second mechanism seems to provide relief from depression in the days and weeks that follow the ketamine treatment and there also appears to be a third mechanism by which ketamine can induce longlasting changes in the nervous system and it is those three mechanisms short medium and longterm mechanisms that produce the kinds of changes in neurochemistry and more importantly changes in actual neural circuit wiring that allows ketamine to provide this incredible relief from depression so next we're going to turn to what those mechanisms are because in understanding those mechanisms you will understand how ketamine provides this relief from depression but you'll also come to understand the more important broader theme of what depression is really all about at a neural circuit level and how relief from depression is all about neuroplasticity as many of you know I've been taking ag1 daily since 200 12 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational

receptor and that the nmda receptor is critical for many forms not all but many forms of neuroplasticity now I realize some of you might be familiar with so-called liand and receptors but most of you probably are not a liand is a chemical that binds to a receptor and a receptor is like a little parking spot on the outside of a cell there can also be receptors inside of cells but most of the time when we're talking about nerve cells neurons and you hear the word receptors you're hearing about receptors on the outside of the cell so the nmda receptor does not exist in our neurons in order to bind ketamine it's there actually to bind all sorts of other things that are endogenous that are naturally made by us but ketamine has a very high what's called Affinity it has a very high probability of binding to the nmda receptor if it's introduced to our bloodstream so when ketamine is taken in pill form sublingual form meaning under the tongue when it's injected into the muscle or the vein it gets into the bloodstream and then it's able to cross easily across the bloodb brain barrier so-call BBB bloodb brain barrier the bloodb brain barrier keeps a lot of things out of the brain but ketamine can very readily pass across the blood brain barrier once it's in the brain it has a very high affinity for meaning it knows how to seek out and bind to those nmda receptors now the simplest way to explain how nmda receptors ordinary contribute to neuroplasticity is that they represent what's called an and gate and an and gate as the name suggests is a function in a cell or in a system where two things have to be present in fact for those of you that have a bit of an engineering or computer programming background you'll be familiar with and gates for those of you that don't don't worry about it I'm going to explain what an and gate is right now an and gate in the context of nervous system function is when two things are present like chemical a and chemical B both have to be present in order for some process say neuroplasticity to occur the nmda receptor as I mentioned earlier is a receptor on the surface of neurons and it binds glutamate which is a molecule that we all make in our brain and it activates other neurons it's what's called an excitatory neurotransmitter now there are lots of different receptors for glutamate and those receptors are binding glutamate all the time however in order to activate the nmda receptor there has to be a lot of glutamate present and it has to happen over very brief period of time so the nmda receptor is an and gate in the sense that glutamate has to be present and to bind it and it has to get a lot of electrical activity a lot of input in order for that to happen so it's a receptor that responds primarily to unusually high or frequent levels of electrical activity let's place this in real world context so that it makes a bit more sense I like most all of you and moving my arms around a lot throughout the day now as an adult my motor cortex the area of my brain that controls motor coordination in my limbs has connections from my brain to my spinal cord from my spinal cord to my muscles and that's what allows me to move my limbs under conditions of just moving my limbs and doing things throughout the day drinking a cup of coffee or Y bate you know walking outside to view some sunlight in the morning doing the things that I do every single day and that I already know how to do glutamate is definitely involved in that process glutamate binding to its other receptor types which are called ampa receptors for those of you that want to know that's involved in that process it's typical levels of activity if however I were to sit down at this desk and be commanded to or decide to do some specific motor limb movement let's say move my hand in a three dot sequence for those of you watching you can see this for those of you that are listening don't worry about it it's not very interesting to watch the point is just that I'm going to put my finger down in one two three points on the desk in front of me and then 3 2 1 points coming back to me now that's obviously a motor sequence that I can perform I just did it so clearly I can perform it but if I were to do that for let's say an hour what would happen is the neurons that are involved in generating that motor sequence of 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 3 2 1 would be active over and over and over again and what would likely happen because of that unusual frankly motor behavior is that the neurons responsible for generating that motor Behavior would be able to detect it as unusually frequent unusually high levels of activity in the circuits that generate that behavior and the increase in glutamate that's impinging on the neurons in that circuit would bind the nmda receptor making it change several important things the first of which is that your nervous system is capable of changing but that's an energetically demanding process so the incredible thing about neuroplasticity is that when you generate an unusually high or just an unusual pattern of activity motor activity or you're hearing a new language you're trying to learn that or you're navigating a new city the neurons are firing in ways that are a typical for them and they are firing a lot more and so the neurons are going to bind glutamate the nmda receptor is going to be activated and then Downstream of nmda receptor activation are a bunch of what we call intracell processes a bunch of things that happen in the cells to try and make that behavior occur again and again if needed but without the huge energetic demand you've experienced this before when you're trying to learn something and it feels sluggish it feels hard it's frustrating and then eventually you learn it and it's very fasile it's very easy one of the reasons for that is that when the nmda receptor is activated by these infrequent or unusual patterns of activity it can then recruit other glutamate receptors the more typical kind the ampa type receptors to the cell surface and then those receptors can simply bind the glutamate and allow that behavior to occur without this whole process that's involved in neuroplasticity having to engage and do things like build new proteins in the cell build new Machinery Etc so to just step back from this the way to think about the nmda receptor is that activation of the nmda receptor only occurs under conditions of unusually high or simply unusual patterns of activity that the nmda receptor yes controls neural activity in the immediate sense like when it's activated it's changing the patterns of activity in the neuron sure but it also can engage gene expression and introduce new receptors to the cell basically giving the cell the ability to then recreate the patterns of activity without having to do it in such a metabolically demanding way in fact a good analogy for all of this is the way that muscles can hypertrophy right if you overload muscles properly through resistance training of any kind and then give them a period of rest there's recruitment of specific things to the muscle fibers as well as recruitment of changes in the nerves that innervate that control the contraction of those muscles and then those muscles grow they get stronger Etc and they're able to function and use that new strength and new growth and you don't have to damage those muscle fibers or trigger those adaptations over and over again to maintain them because you have this new capability now I realize that's a lot of details about nmda receptors and neuroplasticity but really if we needed to pick one biological mechanism that resides at the center of many many important forms of neuroplasticity it would be the nmda receptor and its functions that I just told you about so now that you have that in mind that these nmda receptors are critical at detecting unusual activity making changes to cells so those cells can then respond to that activity in the future you have in mind the conceptual basis for understanding how ketamine works because as I've mentioned several times already ketamine is an nmda receptor blocker antagonist and yet we know that a lot of the changes in the brain that underly the transition from a depressed state to a non-depressed state involve neuroplasticity so what's going on there well what's going on there turns out to be extremely interesting and you can understand it very easily if you understand that there are essentially two major types of neurons in the brain you have those excitatory neurons meaning neurons that when they are activated electrically they activate or excite other neurons at least they try to they release neurotransmitter into the synapse which is the little gap between neurons the neurons on the other side have receptors they bind those neurotransmitters in this case glutamate which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and then there's a high probability that those other neurons will be excited that they will be electrically active that's one major type of so-called neurotransmission in the brain the other major type of neurotransmission in the brain is called inhibitory neurotransmission inhibitory neurotransmission involves neurons that release the neurotransmitter Gaba or sometimes also another molecule called glycine but mostly Gaba when Gaba is released it has the property of reducing the probability that the next neuron will be electrically active in fact gaba's job is to bind The receptors on the next cell and to make it less electrically active so we've got excitatory neurotransmission and we have inhibitory neurotransmission and just to place inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission into context if you think about a condition like epilepsy which involves seizures of either the smaller type called petite M seizures or Grandma seizures which are the type in which people have body-wide convulsions they are often disengaged from whatever is going on around them in those moments they're shaking quite a lot Etc there are many causes of seizures but to get to the heart of what a seizure is it is essentially runaway excitation in the brain a small region of the brain becomes especially electrically active and then it spreads out from that fosi that focus of the excitation and it recruits a lot of neurons in a fairly non-specific way creating these seizur like motor patterns in the body and patterns of activity in the brain that can involve engagement from immediate experience and lack of perception sometimes there's Aura there's a whole discussion to be had about seizure and by the way seizure can occur in a lot of different contexts of course it can occur in epilepsy it can occur after a head injury Etc we'll cover seizure in a future episode of this podcast of course but one of the major causes of seizure and by extension lack of seizure is that ordinarily inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons are in this kind of push pull that for somebody that doesn't experience seizures puts the brain in balance so they don't have seizures right the inhibitory neurons are suppressing the activity of many neurons so that those many neurons don't get runaway excitation you don't get seizures the excitatory neurons are feeding back onto the inhibitory neurons so everything is kept in Balance there isn't too much inhibition there isn't too much excitation everything's in Balance okay so now you understand that there are nmda receptors and these are critical for many forms of neuroplasticity you also understand that there are excitatory neurons which stimulate the electrical activity of other neurons and that there are inhibitory neurons in your brain that inhibit or suppress the activity of other neurons and that you need excitatory and inhibitory communication between neurons at all times and that it has to remain in balance and that the nmda receptor is normally just sort of sitting there not doing a whole lot unless levels of neural activity are elevated above their normal Baseline and then you can get ch in the neural circuits and those changes can be very longlasting and let's not forget the piece of information most pertinent to today's discussion which is about ketamine which is that ketamine blocks that nmda receptor and there's the conundrum I keep coming back to which is you need neuroplasticity in order to get relief from depression so what researchers have discovered is that yes ketamine blocks the nmda receptor it actually quiets down neurons it prevents neurons from being as active as they normally would be and yet somehow almost paradoxically it increases neuroplasticity in brain circuits that are involved in mood in reward in self-reflection we'll get into what those brain circuits are in a little bit the way it works is that ketamine binds to the nmda receptor present on inhibitory neurons and in doing so dramatically reduces the amount of inhibition coming from those in inhibitory neurons onto excitatory neurons when that happens the excitatory neurons in specific circuits of the brain are allowed to increase their activity they do what's called bursting bursting is a pattern of electrical activity whereby normally one of these excitatory neurons is releasing glutamate in a pattern that might look or sound like this it actually doesn't make a sound in the brain but if you were to record from one of these neurons which people have done many times over and then you were to convert the electrical signal in those neurons to an audio monitor you would hear the firing the action potential of those neurons as a that's what it actually sounds like on the Audio Monitor it sounds like a little bit of static but if the normal firing of the neuron is which is the pretty typical Baseline firing of the neurons and the relevant circuits to mood that I'm going to be discussing under conditions where ketamine has been brought into the system binds that nmda receptor blocks the output of those inhibitory neurons onto the excitatory neuron now the excitatory neuron is firing in burst and those bursting patterns of electrical activity are the absolute perfect patterns of activity that induce not just short-term but long-term changes in the neural circuits associated with reward with dopamine release with disappointment and with mood in ways that are directly relevant to suppressing or providing relief from the symptoms of major depression now I realize what I just told you is a lot of information in fact what I just described represents essentially what I would teach to an advanced undergraduate SLG graduate course Medical School course on neuroplasticity and how ketamine works so keep in mind that we're having a discussion here that is at a fairly high level and if you could understand even a tiny fraction even just one bit of what I just described you're doing great if you could understand more outstanding just to make sure that everyone's on the same page as we move forward because I do want to make sure that everyone understands ketamine and how it works because it does have these sort of cryptic functions of engaging neuroplasticity in ways that aren't obvious if you just ask you know what does ketamine do when you inject it what does ketamine produce in terms of a feeling State and then you know how does somebody get relief from depression that can all start to get a little bit muddled unless you understand the following so I'm going to tell it to you again in just very top Contour terms somebody takes a pill or an injection or sublingual k it makes its way into the bloodstream and then it makes its way into the brain once it's in the brain it binds to a particular category of receptors called the nmda receptor the nmda receptor is a receptor that normally is quient it's just kind of sitting there it doesn't tend to do a lot under normal conditions of everyday life however the nmda receptor's typical function okay so when there's no ketamine in the body or brain is to detect abnormal levels of neural activity and in doing so recruit changes to cells receptors Etc literally change the neurons in ways that allow them to respond to that activity in the future without having to be under such big metabolic demand and they do that by recruiting more receptors Etc much in the same way as when you overload a muscle in the gym it will eventually recover if you allow it to recover and it will get stronger through the addition of a bunch of new proteins the ner communication of that muscle will change the muscle and the nerve to muscle connection change it gets stronger and sometimes it gets bigger and stronger in the same way a neuron can change the way it functions in response to experience and neurons don't know experience of life in any other way except the patterns of electrical activity and chemical activity that impinges on them okay now ketamine the drug binds to and blocks that nmda receptor so the obvious conclusion would be that ketamine prevents neuroplasticity and that's not what happens we know that ketamine actually induces neuroplasticity and it does so specifically in the brain circuits that control mood the net consequence being improvements in mood how does that happen it happens because ketamine binds to and blocks those nmda receptors on inhibitory neurons the inhibitory neurons are the neurons that normally suppress the activity of other neurons so when ketamine binds to the nmda receptor the activity of those inhibitory neurons is reduced and as a consequ quence excitatory communication between neurons in those mood related circuits increases and it increases in a way that recruits neuroplasticity that strengthens those connections and makes them more likely to be active in the future now it is not the case at least at clinical doses that ketamine induces seizures it certainly can at higher doses but at clinical doses when ketamine supresses the activity of those inhibitory neurons and the excitatory neurons ramp up their activity they're ramping up activity a lot and enough to create changes in those neural circuits associated with mood and the changes are in the direction of making those neural circuits more likely to generate positive mood and less likely to generate negative mood we'll get into the specifics of those circuits in a little bit but ketamine is not creating the kind of enormous increases and excitatory communication between neurons that leads to that runaway excitation now the point of the discussion we just had over the last 10 minutes or so was several fold first of all I do believe it's important to to understand the key components of neuroplasticity which is this remarkable feature of our brain and nervous system that we all have right this ability to change our own brain circuits no other organ in the body as far as we know can direct its own changes but we can direct our own brain changes and the nmda receptor is absolutely critical for that I also think it's important to understand the difference between inhibitory and excitatory communication between neurons because that's just Central to understanding brain function brain function is a series of accelerators and brakes it's not all about neurons stimulating other neurons it's also about neurons preventing the activation of other neurons that's just Central to everything not just preventing seizures but it's Central to learning it's Central to Vision it's Central to hearing it's Central to creativity it is at the core of brain function and the other reason to have the discussion we just did is that ketamine has this incredible property it can literally change the neural circuits that generate mood that generate your feelings of well-being but it does so through a somewhat convoluted pathway right it blocks the receptor that everyone thinks is involved in neuroplasticity and in doing so it actually creates neuroplasticity now even though I just described all of that to you over the last 10 minutes or so keep in mind that what I just describe to you as a process that actually occurs in the brain takes many many days it involves cells changing gene expression making new proteins new receptors anytime we say neuroplasticity even when you read about So-Cal called short-term neuroplasticity it is happening over the course of at least many many hours and more likely many days or even weeks so the process I just described of how ketamine creates neuroplasticity through blockade of nmda receptors is very likely to be the process that explains the longer term changes in mood and affect that are associated with ketamine therapy for the treatment of depression now it is possible that ketamine blocking the nmda receptor is also resp responsible for some of the immediate effects of ketamine that people experience when they take the drug the dissociation the in some cases Euphoria and that sort of dreamlike state that it can put people into that is possible but it's very clear that the nmda receptor blockade is critical for the neuroplastic changes that are going to occur over the days and weeks following ketamine treatment and if you think back to our earlier discussion when we were talking about the two time a week over three week type regimen of taking ketamine or some variant on that now it might start to make sense as to why yes there is immediate and short-term benefit of taking ketamine for depression in the clinically appropriate setting of course I'm not talking about recreational use right now but that also there's some durability of those effects that even after the three weeks of taking ketamine twice per week people often will experience weeks or months of relief from depression when they're not doing the weekly ketamine therapy sessions so that longer term relief that I'm referring to as durability of the treatment is very likely to be the consequence of actual neural circuit rewiring now there's an additional and very important facet to this whole discussion about neuroplasticity in response to ketamine treatment for depression if you recall the the burst firing that induces that plasticity I told you it induces plasticity but I didn't tell you how now you already could imagine some of the mechanisms it could be insertion of those new glut receptors those Amper receptors that we talked about however even for that to happen a bunch of other things have to happen first but one of the key ones to understand is the thing I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode bdnf which stands for brain derived neutrophic Factor brain derived neutrophic factor is an incredible molecule I should mention that it's one of many growth factors in the brain and it has its own set of receptors it binds to something called the track B receptor TR rkb track B receptor when bdnf binds to track B receptors on neurons it does a lot of things it sets off a whole Cascade of things including the insertion of new glutamate receptors so that those neurons become extra sensitive to any input they get so that's one form of change that bdnf can create bdnf can also alter the overall shape of neurons it can cause neurons to grow new branches so that it can receive new inputs from other neurons anytime bdnf is discussed in popular books or the popular press people will talk about it as quote unquote fertilizer for neurons I don't really like that term because it really undervalues the total number of things that bdnf can do bdnf actually can act as its own kind of neurotransmitter it can actually stimulate other neurons and it does a bunch of other things but for sake of this discussion about ketamine understand that that burst firing of neurons that very high frequency firing of neurons can invoke the release of bdnf in ways that make those circuits very plastic very quickly and in addition to that there's some evidence that ketamine itself may be able to cause release of bdnf directly without having to go through all of the mechanisms that I overwhelmed you with a few minutes ago or hopefully didn't overwhelm you with but that I taught to you a few minutes ago now what's especially exciting about bdnf in the context of ketamine therapy for depression is that it appears based on both preclinical and clinical studies that bdnf isn't just one of the ways in which ketamine can invoke neuroplasticity and these improvements in mood it may actually be required it may be the central process to all of that now it can still be Downstream of all that nmda receptor stuff that we talked about before but there's several lines of evidence that suggest that ketamine induced release of bdnf is one of the core mechanisms by which ketamine can relieve depression now there are several lines of evidence to support what I just said about bdnf in the context of ketamine first of all in mice that lack bdnf they have no bdnf they can't make bdnf because they don't have the gene for bdnf we call those bdnf knockout mice in those mice if you give them ketamine and you put them into that learned helplessness task that we talked about a bit earlier where you put them into water and see how long they swim normally ketamine would allow a mouse to swim longer to fight for its life longer well it no longer does that in a bdnf knockout Mouse and the only thing that's different about that Mouse as far as we know is the lack of bdnf and there are ways to make sure that it's lack of bdnf in the specific neurons that are relevant to everything we're talking about not just that their limbs don't work as well Etc in other words all the appropriate control experiments have been done that's preclinical data because it comes from animal models in addition to that depressed people who have a mutant form of bdnf so these humans are not Knockouts for bdnf they can make bdnf but the bdnf doesn't function normally in those people they have a very reduced response to ketamine treatment for depression suggesting that bdnf action is at least one of the critical functions that allows ketamine to relieve depression and as I mentioned earlier ketamine can actually invoke the release of bdnf and get this there's some evidence that ketamine itself can bind to the track B receptor that is it can bind to the BD dnf receptor it can mimic bdnf so this is an entirely different way of thinking about ketamine than we normally hear about nowadays we hear a lot about ketamine and ketamine therapy we also hear fortunately about some of the problems of ketamine abuse and we will talk about some of those concerns a little bit later and we hear about bdnf this so-called brain fertilizer but rarely if ever do we hear that ketamine itself can mimic the effects of bdnf in the brain but researchers and clinicians are definitely paying attention to this and it's starting to raise what I consider a very exciting model of how ketamine could provide relief for depression which is that it's acting as a growth factor in the brain or at least it's mimicking the action of growth factors allowing the specific neural circuits that control things like mood outlook on the future self-reflection Etc allowing those circuits to change in ways that provide significant relief for major depression and in doing so and this is a very important point it appears that ketamine is relieving depression in ways that are entirely different from any other kind of treatment now in an earlier episode about psilocybin and its potential role for the treatment of depression I went into a lot of depth about how psilocybin can induce neuroplasticity to provide relief for major depression in certain individuals under certain conditions I do want to highlight that because indeed it's another case where neuroplasticity is involved but in that situation as some of you may remember or if you don't don't worry I'll tell you right now it was a pretty straightforward model psilocybin looks a lot like serotonin chemically except that psilocybin binds a particular receptor when that receptor is bound it allows these brainwide changes those brainwide changes seem to change one's reflection on oneself so-call ego dissolution changes in mood that are stable over time etc etc it was all pretty straightforward with ketamine it's clear there are multiple mechanisms involved and perhaps most importantly with ketamine it's that immediate relief that occurs day of or close to day of treatment and in the days afterwards and it's that long-term relief that very likely is is the consequence of nmda receptor suppression burst activity in neurons Within These mood related circuits bdnf being released and changing neural circuits strengthening them in order to give elevated mood as a consequence of that bursting activity and ketamine mimicking bdnf in other words ketamine acting more or less like a growth factor in the brain in order to make sure that whatever changes occur in those neural circuits to elevate mood are durable that they really are reinforced and last over time I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the so-called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams that's 1 gram of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligram of magnesium I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes and while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if I've been sweating a lot and certainly I drink element in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of sweating if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lm.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lnt.com huberman so basically I've discussed two major mechanisms for how ketamine can induce neuroplasticity leading to improvements in mood and affect that gives relief for depression those two mechanisms are linked or at the very least are happening in parallel they're happening at the same time in the brain now just to make matters more interesting there's an incredible twist into this whole thing of how ketamine works and when I say how ketamine works I'm not just talking about how ketamine provides relief for depression I'm also talking about why people use ketamine for recreational purposes and it is the following yes ketamine has all these impacts on excitatory neurons inhibitory neurons bdnf etc etc but ketamine can also bind receptors in the opioid path pathway now what is the opioid pathway don't worry here I'm not going to hit you with a lot of details but we've all heard of the opioid crisis by now or at least most of you have the opioid crisis refers specifically to people taking exogenous opioids taking opioids right so taking pills that activate particular receptors in the brain that lead to analesa in some cases so pain relief that lead to changes in mood there's a lot to be said about the opioid crisis it's called a crisis for a reason many many people are addicted to those compounds that's a discussion for another time keep in mind that The receptors those drugs bind to are opioid receptors and those receptors that you and I all have by the way do not exist in order to bind drugs that are made by pharmaceutical companies they exist in our brain and body to bind to the so-called endogenous naturally made opioids that we all make and those receptors have different names the MU opioid receptor the Kappa opioid receptor Etc they tend to have the name of Greek letters to differentiate them now ketamine can bind to various opioid receptors and when opioid receptors are bound we know that creates certain effects things like pain relief things like changes in psychic States dissociation for example if enough of them are bound you can get euphoric States under certain conditions of high dose binding of ketamine to those opioid receptors you can start getting into plain of anesthesia where people lose Consciousness and actually have no response to pain whatsoever if you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier where ketamine was used to relieve depression well the dosage used in that study as you recall was half a milligram per kilogram of body weight that is the dosage that will induce these dissociative mild Euphoria those sorts of states of mine but where people are still conscious when you start getting to dosages of ketamine that are in the range of one at 2 milligram per kilogram of body weight now you're talking about anesthetic Doses and when that happens you're going to get full parking full saturation of all the potential receptors that ketamine can bind to those nmda receptors it's going to block those it's also going to bind to the so-called mu opioid receptors and maybe this other type as well for those of you that want to know u aisian a also the Kappa type opioid receptors and so what we've got here is a drug ketamine that is hitting two different system the glutamate related system and the endogenous opioid system and researchers and clinicians have logically started to ask whether or not some or all of the effects of ketamine are due to the opioid system and they want to know which effects those are now this is where things start to get really interesting both in the context of clinical treatment of depression and recreational use first of all when people take ketamine again it enters the bloodstream and it goes into the brain brain but it is metabolized to something called hnk which is hydroxy norketamine now I don't expect you to know what hydroxy norketamine is and I don't expect you to care about it until I tell you what I'm about to tell you which is that hydroxy norketamine has an incredible specificity for the MU opioid receptor and maybe that Kappa opioid receptor as well in other words when we talk about ketamine that's the drug people take but when it goes into the body it's converted into yet another drug drug and that other drug hydroxy norketamine is selectively activating the opioid system so this led researchers to ask at a very important question which is when a human being takes ketamine in order to treat their depression and they get some relief from depression is that the consequence of neuroplastic changes in all those nmda glutamate bdnf related circuits that we talked about before or is it the consequence of something happening in the opioid system okay you can't ignore the fact that ketamine has this property of binding to these opioid receptors because they have such a powerful effect on our thinking on our mood on our state of consciousness it's entirely reasonable that the opioid system could be a major player if not the major player in this whole depression relief thing and maybe even in the creation of dissociative symptomology when people take ketamine recreationally so what researchers clinicians did is they undertook a series of experiments where they gave people ketamine for the relief of depression but they also blocked the opioid receptor system and they did that using a drug called Naltrexone so what I'm about to describe to you is a study done by my colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine namely Dr Nolan Williams and Alan shatur and colleagues entitled attenuation of anti-depressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine by opioid receptor antagonism and as a consequence of me reading you that title a moment ago you now already have the conclusion of the study what they observed is that when people were given ketamine got relief from depression that wasn't surprising again many studies had shown that before since the early 2000s if however individuals were given now treone to block the opioid receptor pathway and they were given ketamine well then the anti-depressant effects of ketamine were no longer observed now that suggests that it is the opioid receptor system that's responsible for the anti-depressant effects of ketamine and perhaps this hnk this hydroxy nor ketamine which is the metabolite of is the way in which ketamine normally relieves depression now a lot of people took note of these studies because after all there are probably dozens if not hundreds of studies looking at the effects of ketamine on all that nmda receptor stuff and indeed neuroplasticity and mood related circuits can't be discounted as one way in which ketamine provides relief from depression but what was very interesting is that in people given ketamine and Naltrexone those people still experienced the immediate effects of ketamine the mild Euphoria the dissociation the feelings that one would normally expect when people were under the effects of ketamine but what they didn't get were the longer term changes in mood that we would call relief from depression now of course the goal of modern Psychiatry is to treat depression not to block the effects of these drugs that are capable of treating depression now what the study does and by the way there are several studies like it that support these General set of findings that part of the critical role of ketamine in providing relief from depression is to activate the opioid system but what this study does is it really points to the fact that when we say ketamine treatment or we talk about somebody taking ketamine recreationally for that matter we have to pay attention to what's happening while they are under the influence of the drug we also have to pay attention to what's happening in the days and weeks after they're under the influence of the drug and perhaps most importantly this calls to mind a really important idea which is that whether or not you're talking about ketamine induced relief from depression or psilocybin induced relief for depression or MDMA induced relief for PTSD a topic that I covered on a previous episode of this podcast we have to step back and look at the idea that the effects of the drug that people experience whatever those may be because obviously it's going to depend on what particular drug they took those immediate effects may not actually be related to the long-term clinical benefit of those particular drugs now I realize that many people might not like that idea and frankly I don't actually think that's the way that it works I don't think it's going to be an either or situation however because drugs like ketamine psilocybin MDMA have such profound effects on people's psychic States when they are under the influence of them and because at least in the proper clinical setting and use they do seem to provide impressive relief from a lot of these psychiatric challenges like depression and PTSD people naturally correlate those two things they couple those two things in fact they collapse those two things and presume that their experience of what they saw what they heard how they felt while they were under the influence of the drug was actually the stimulus that created the relief from their clinical condition like depression but what these data on combined treatment with ketamine and nxone to block the MU opioid receptor really show us is that that may not actually be the way that it works it may be that the effects of a drug like ketamine that one experiences while interesting perhaps even profound perhaps great Insight comes to one when they do that therapy in the proper context it is not clear at all that it is that experience and the effects of those drugs in those immediate minutes and hours that's actually what's causing the relief from depression now again I don't think it's an either or I like to view the whole situation more or less as a sort of wavefront that the experience that one has subjectively while they are under the influence of a drug like ketamine or psilocybin or MDMA sets off a series and in fact multiple serieses is that a word multiple types of processes in the brain some of which rely on things like nmda receptor bdnf Etc type neuroplasticity others which rely on the opioid receptor pathway and that each of these have different time courses such that some provide immediate relief in the days and hours after treatment some in the weeks after treatment and some more durable long- lasting changes that can occur over months or maybe even years and a really important thing to underscore in the context of all this is that throughout today's discussion we've been talking about drugs and receptors and relief from depression but what we're really talking about here are people who get relief from depression and almost with certainty when they get relief from depression they are also starting to do other things they are going back to work they are engaging in relationships again they are viewings differently again hopefully they're getting morning sunlight and exercising and eating well and doing all the sorts of things that we would call anti-depressive behaviors and it is impossible to separate the positive behavioral consequences of a drug treatment for depression from the drug itself in a way that lets us say Okay ketamine relieved depression and then as a consequence people went and did a bunch of behaviors that were healthy for them or stopped engaging in behaviors that were unhealthy for them so we can think of behaviors as Pro depressive or anti-depressive in fact we know that one particular behavior that is viewing blue light in the middle of the night between the hours of say 11 p.m. and 4: a.m. is known to invoke a pro depressive circuit it involves a structure called the habenula I've talked about this on previous podcasts it tends to lower dopamine and increase cortisol and the day is following that exposure to light etc etc so there are pro depressive behaviors and there are anti-depressive behaviors we know that viewing morning sunlight getting regular and sufficient amounts of quality sleep proper nutrition proper social engagement there is now a plethora of quality research pointing to the fact that those are true anti-depressive behaviors so we can never separate out the effects of a drug from the effects of a drug that feed back on and combine with the effects of the drug that one is hoping for in this case depression relief okay so I've been bookending this conversation about ketamine at two very Divergent levels meaning we've been talking about high level stuff relief from depressive symptoms right we haven't been going into a lot of detail about that but that's pretty high level we're talking about thought changes behavioral changes that we're calling anti-depressive right changes in mood and affect that are positive positive anticipation of the future etc etc and then we've also been talking a lot at this other end which is very reductionist down at the cellar molecular level we talking about receptors and binding of receptors and neuroplasticity and track B and all that stuff we've completely neglected meaning I've completely neglected until now what Bridges those two levels of understanding and what Bridges those two levels of understanding are the neural circuits that actually change when one takes ketamine whether or not those changes occur quickly whether or not they take a longer period of time whether or not they involve nmda receptors or the opioid receptor systems or both we know that certain neural circuits change when people take ketamine in these patterns of dosage and frequency of about half a milligram per kilogram and again that's the injected form twice per week over 3 week weeks and then they get some durable resistance to depression fortunately we can talk about those neural circuits without having to bring about a lot more gnomen clature a lot of new language and I say fortunately because I realize today you've been hit with a lot of new terms now I've already mentioned one of the key brain structures and that's the habenula a few moments ago I talked about the habenula in the context of people who get too much bright to light exposure in the middle of the night that activates the habenula it's a sort of a disappointment circuit we can call it that because we know that leads to Pro depressive symptoms in animal models and very likely in humans as well and it does so we know by reducing dopamine and increasing cortisol there is evidence that when people undergo ketamine therapy connections between the habenula what we can broadly just talk about as a structure involved in generating a feeling of disappointment the connections between the habenula and the reward circuitry of the brain which I've talked about several times before on this podcast but for those of you that aren't familiar with it this is the so-called Mis limic reward pathway has areas like the ventral tegmental area the nucleus accumbens don't worry at all about those names just know that this is a brain area that is chocka block full of neurons that release dopamine which is a molecule that tends to increase smoth increase motivation in many ways we can think about it at least for sake of this discussion as anti-depressive so what we've got is a structure the habenula that normally provides inhibitory and now you know what that means inhibitory input to this reward pathway that releases dopamine and when people take ketamine that inhibition is lessened such that the reward pathway is more available for engagement through daily life activities now I say available for engagement through daily life activities for a very specific purpose which is that all of the changes in neural circuits that we're talking about that can come about from taking a drug well those changes don't actually do a whole lot unless those circuits are reinforced by particular behaviors so this relates back to what I said just a few minutes ago about pro-depressive and anti-depressive behaviors somebody can take ketamine and potentially get relief from depression but if they continue to engage in Pro depressive behaviors they are not going to get much of any relief from depression conversely if somebody takes ketamine and they are reducing the amount of output from this disappointment circuit this habenula to the reward circuitry of the brain and they do engage in behaviors such as seeking out work that stimulates them seeking out social engagement taking good care of their body their mental health their physical health Etc well those circuits are not designed to respond to ketamine they are designed to respond to particular patterns of thinking and behavior so again we can't forget that when we hear that a drug causes plasticity in a given neural circuit what it's doing is it's biasing the balance or the probability that those neural circuits will be engaged by certain activities but one still has to engage in those activities now fortunately when people tend to have elevations in mood they tend to move around more when they tend to move around more they tend to engage in more things when they tend to engage in more things if they have a positive outlook on life presumably they are engaging in adaptive things things like social relationships job related School rated goal related Behavior so it's important to understand that a discussion of neural circuit changes in response to ketamine is really discussion of neural circuit changes in response to ketamine that shift one's overall system toward having yet further neural circuit changes in response to daily activities and thereby bolstering health or in this case mental health now it's also important to understand that rarely if ever does a drug provide relief for some sort of clinical challenge in just a one track kind of way the way to think about this is that most mental processes and certainly things like depression are a two-way Road you have Pro depressive behaviors in circuits and you have anti-depressive behaviors and circuits and so perhaps it won't be surprising to you that there's evidence that ketamine treatment can reduce the output from the habenula to the reward pathway this disappointment to reward pathway weakening that making the reward pathway more available for engagement through thoughts and behaviors that are anti-depressive and in addition to that it can further bolster the neuroplasticity within the reward pathway itself in particular with connections with the frontal cortex and for those of you that aren't familiar with the frontal cortex your frontal Cort does a lot of things but one of the things that your frontal cortex is absolutely critical for is for establishing context dependent strategy meaning for allowing you to say okay in a given circumstance what should I do to get the results I want in another circumstance what should I do to get the results I want it's not strategizing of the manipulative type although I suppose it could be it's strategizing of how do I get what I need from this social connection how do I get what I need from my goals and exercise how do I get what I need from my goals in terms of work or school Etc your frontal cortex is that part of your cortex that's always churning ideas it's always wondering am I doing well am I not doing well and is adjusting your behavior accordingly so it's now established that ketamine can improve connectivity that is it can strengthen the connections between areas of the brain that are associated with context dependent strategy building and these reward Pathways in other words it makes people more sensitive to whether or not they are getting the results they want from their efforts and to to how to adjust their efforts so that they do get the results they want from those efforts and there's other evidence that nmda receptor blockade is not the way that ketamine provides relief from depression namely there's a drug called memantine it's used actually to treat Alzheimer's and it too is an nmda receptor blocker and it has no anti-depressant effects now as you recall ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic and one of its primary effects is to create this feeling of dissociation for those of you that aren't familiar with what dis Association is dissociation is where people feel separate from their body they can still think but it's as if they are observing themselves in fact in anticipation for this episode I consulted with several different colleagues in the department of Psychiatry at Stanford school of medicine and one of them describe the effects of ketamine as described by a patient of theirs who had taken ketamine for the treatment of depression and that patient described it as observing themselves thinking observing themselves doing things even though they were lying completely still and perhaps most importantly describing themselves as being above their body and actually looking down on themselves from the third person perspective now that I realize is a foreign experience to most people but of course there are people who experience dissociation even while not on ketamine and as many of you know dissociation is actually one of the primary symptoms of PTSD and Trauma so this raises a sort of conundrum you know why is it that a particular state of mind that's associated with PTSD and Trauma and in some cases depression itself which is induced by a drug like ketamine can provide relief from depression and that all goes back to the neuroplastic changes that we talked about earlier and more likely the changes in the MU opioid receptor system that we talked about earlier but nonetheless the dissociative effects of ketamine are so profound for people that take them that I thought I'd spend a minute or two explaining what likely causes that dissociative third personing of self effect and in so far as we know it has to do with an uncoupling of certain brain circuits in particular neocortical brain circuits the neocortex is the part of the brain the lumpy outside part of the brain that's associated with action planning it does a lot of things really it's involved in sensory perception it's involved in speech generation many many things but the neocortex has connections to other regions which are called subcortical regions and it seems that when people take ketamine or fenine PCP there's an uncoupling of those networks a quieting of those networks that starts to create a different dominant rhythm in the brain some of you may be familiar with rhythms in the brain so-called Alpha rhythms or Alpha patterns of activity that's just dominant patterns of activity associated with particular brain States so for instance Alpha Brain WS are associated with an alert but calm relaxed State of Mind where thoughts are sort of free flowing it's a little bit dreamlike but it isn't really like a dream where anything can happen it has a structure to it when people take ketamine the alpha pattern of activity is completely abolished at least for the duration of time that they're under the influence of the drug which typically is about an hour to two hours or so and a different pattern of brain activity which is called the Theta pattern of brain activity starts to really emerge it's as if it gets unveiled and that Theta pattern of activity is the one that's associated with a dreamlike state it's the one that resides more or less at that Lial border between wakefulness and sleep if you've ever been falling asleep and you were thinking something like you were running and you kicked your leg it's very likely that you were in Theta pattern of activity your brain at that moment just prior to when you woke up whereas when you're more alert you see patterns of activity that are higher frequency things like Alpha Beta rhythms and so forth so ketamine produces particular patterns of brain activity and this sense of dissociation when it's taken at subanesthetic doses if you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier they injected half a milligram per kilogram of body weight in order to provide depression relief for those patients when people take ketamine they will take it by different routes of delivery and now here we have to expand our conversation to include both the clinical context research studies and recreational use now I do that because typically when people take ketamine in a study in a clinical study they will get an intravenous into the vein or an intramuscular into the muscle injection of half a milligram per kilogram of body weight ketamine however when people are taking ketamine recreationally or when they are accessing ketamine legally by prescription and taking it at home which is becoming a more common practice they will often take it orally in pill form or they will take it sub lingually by putting it under the tongue or in their cheek and then that so-called troch dissolves and the ketamine goes into their system now an important thing to understand is that when people take ketamine orally only 25% of the active form of ketamine makes it into the bloodstream and when they take it sublingually typically only about 35% of the total amount of ketamine they take is converted into metabolically active ketamine that acts on the neurons in their brain so when you hear about the dosages used in studies they are going to generally involve injections of ketamine and far lower doses of ketamine than when you hear about people taking ketamine orally or sublingually so for instance I weigh 220 PBS that's 100 kilograms so if I were to be in one of these studies which I have not been but if I were I would be given 50 milligram of ketamine by way of injection however if I were going to try to achieve the same amount of active ketamine in my bloodstream and brain as I would through injection I would need to ingest three times as much ketamine by way of pill and perhaps a little bit more by way of sublingual ketamine if I wanted to get the same effects so if I were to take 50 milligrams by way of injection in a study and I went to a different study and they said okay we want to recreate that effect we're going to give you a pill typically they're going to give me 150 mg of ketamine in a pill form form or 200 Mig of ketamine in the troch sublingual form now it's really important to understand this dose dependence according to delivery business because I realize that nowadays especially a lot of people are taking ketamine through legal sources so they're accessing it legally but they're taking it outside the clinic and more typically they're taking it not by way of injection meaning they're taking higher dose ketamine and they're taking it sublingually or orally so it's very important to understand this dose dependent according to mode of delivery business now in anticipation of this episode I put out a request for questions about ketamine on Twitter and I got many many questions some excellent ones therein but one of the more common questions was what is a khole in scientific terms a khole is what's used to describe the subjective experience of when somebody takes ketamine typically recreationally and they end up in basically a pseudo anesthetized state that means is that they took a dosage that for them put them beyond the boundary of the subanesthetic dose and has them transitioning into the anesthesia level dose of ketamine now I mentioned everything I did about dosages before because it's very important to know that different people even if they are of equivalent body weight are going to respond to ketamine differently depending on how quickly and how thoroughly they metabolize ketamine so in the clinical context injections of ketamine into the vein or into the muscle are done at this half a milligram per kilogram dose and they have clinicians there they have researchers there who are paying attention to whether or not the person is in a dissociative state if they're still conscious and to see whether or not the person is going into full-blown anesthesia now that's one of the values of doing ketamine in the context of a legal clinical setting however I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that a lot of people are getting ketamine legally but then taking it at home hopefully not alone hopefully there's someone there to monitor them or they're in session with their physician over Zoom that's actually happening more and more these days through tella Health but that itself also has certain risks right because if the person needs something and they don't have someone there immediately in the room to take care of it that could be a very problematic situation and of course there are situations where people are taking ketamine recreationally regardless of how they're acquiring it they're taking it and they are guessing how they are going to respond to it based on some crude understanding of dosages but when people talk about a khole what they're talking about is taking ketamine at a dose that for them takes them beyond the mild or perhaps even an extreme dissociation and starts placing them into full-blown anesthesia and that itself actually can be dangerous going into anesthesia likee planes of Consciousness while not always deadly can be deadly and it certainly can be and has been deadly when people start to combine it with other drugs in particular drugs like barbituates or alcohol so I want to be very clear that the dosage ranges that you hear about when hearing about ketamine are extremely Broad and so is the variability to any one given dose and so too is the response to a given dose in a given person depending on the route of delivery you need to be very careful about the ability of ketamine to take you into deep deep planes of unconsciousness and in some cases death and of course as with any sedative one needs to be extremely cautious about doing anything like driving or even walking in traffic or walking anywhere in some cases if one is under the influence of ketamine additionally for those of you that are seizure prone either due to epilepsy or prior head injury or maybe you're seizure prone and you don't know it ketamine can induce seizures and it should be completely obvious to you now why that's the case ketamine blocks nmda receptors on inhibitory neurons and quiets their activity which of course can lead to Runaway excitation in the brain if you are seizure prone when I put out the request for questions about ketamine on social media I also got a lot of questions about the different forms of ketamine when I say different forms that included questions about whether or not intranasal was better than oral was better than sublingual etc etc to be fair with one exception the different modes of delivery probably relate more to dosage that actually gets metabolized than to anything else what I mean by that is most people don't know how to equate the clinical dose of half a milligram per kilogram of body weight into a dosage to take orally or sublingually or in some cases by the way people will take it rectally and the reason people take ketamine reti is that rectal Administration bypasses the liver and indeed ketamine can be hard on the liver to metabolize it can dramatically increase liver enzymes so oftentimes people that are taking ketamine frequently and don't want to create damage to the liver they will opt for rectal Administration now I realize that unless it's somehow related to your profession anytime some he says intrarectally it raises a few eyebrows and people you know kind of lean back a little bit and I get it in a future episode of the podcast I promise to distinguish between the different modes of drug metabolism depending on whether or not people take something orally sublingually by injection or rectly another common question I got when I solicited for questions about ketamine on social media was about the R versus S versus RS forms of ketamine and I must tell you that sent me down a deep deep Rabbit Hole of research in which I discovered very contradictory evidence for instance I could find papers I did find papers that said that the r form of ketamine had a much greater affinity for the nmda receptor than did the S form of ketamine I also found reviews that said the exact opposite okay and there I was sitting with the two reviews in front of one another wondering if there was something wrong with my visual system until I called a colleague Dr Nolan Williams who's a triple board certified neurologist psychiatrist at Stanford School of Medicine whose laboratory specializes in the use of ketamine for studies of treating depression and for treating depression in the clinical population so I asked him what's the deal here I'm getting very contradictory evidence and he spelled it all out for me it appears based on the clinical data in humans and on binding studies that the S form of ketamine is more potent that is it can more robustly bind to the nmda receptor and in addition to that the S form of ketamine tends to produce less dissociation at a given dosage then does the combined Sr form of ketamine or pure R ketamine he also added and sent me a study that I'll link in the show note captions that there was recently a clinical trial of aramine so pure aramine alone and it failed to relieve depressive symptoms so I said great thank you so much this is now all made very clear to me that esketamine is the preferred form it produces less dissociation and it provides better depression relief and then he said no actually it's a little more complicated than that it appears the situation is the following the combined Sr form of ketamine seems to be the most potent for relieving depressive symptoms the S form of ketamine is second best in terms of providing relief from depressive symptoms and is the one that's most commonly prescribed nowadays by nasal spray by Oral dosing by sublingual dosing and it's what is typically given by way of injection in clinical studies where they do injections and it appears that the r form of ketamine is the least potent and effective in treating depression now I realized that by putting this out into the larger world and assuming that there are experts in ketamine out there either by way of use or by clinical study of their own that I will get a lot of comments back saying no actually the r form was more effective for me than the S form versus the SR form Etc just to reiterate from the clinical trials that have been done we know that the combined Sr form is more potent and effective than the pure s form which is still more effective than the pure R form so that's what we know now based on the clinical studies but of course I acknowledge that anytime a drug is out there as a clinical tool and it's being used recreationally that people are going to explore and they're going to experiment and they're going to find what works best for them so I certainly invite feedback about what has worked best for you hopefully in the clinical context so whether or not people have used ketamine prescription from their doctor whether or not they participated in a clinical study or whether or not they're doing it recreationally I imagine that I will hear about those experiences and I will take note of them another commonly asked question I received was what about micro doing of ketamine there's a lot of interest in micro doing nowadays people are micro doing psilocybin people are micro doing all sorts of things hoping to get some of the the same effects as the macro doses but by using dosages of compounds that are below what would induce say in the case of cybin hallucinations or in the case of ketamine below what would induce the kind of dissociation and euphoric effects that one would have to lie down for a few hours and disengage for the rest of the day I consulted with my clinician colleagues about this and they told me that at present meaning as of yesterday there is zero published clinical evidence that they are aware of and by way of extension that I am aware of in which micro doing ketamine has been effective for the treatment of depression all of the positive effects on depression that I've talked about during this episode are gleaned from studies where people used this half milligram per kilogram dosage of ketamine or it's equivalent by way of some other route of administration not injected but oral or sublingual so are there any benefits to micro do and ketamine as far as the scientific and clinical literature that's published as of today is concerned the answer is no okay so today we covered a lot of information we talked about what ketamine is remember ketamine and PCP angel dust very similar compounds both block the nmda receptor we also talked about what sorts of subjective effects that produces dissociation and Mild Euphoria and third personing of self that's the dissociation when taken at low dosages and when taken at higher dosages it can induce full-blown anesthesia and put people into subconscious States and there's actually a potential even for seizure and death if the dosage is high enough for that person again I want to emphasize that people's dosage sensitivity varies tremendously route of delivery will impact that and on and on we also talked about how the nmda receptor itself and the activation of this incredible molecule bdnf brain derived neutrophic Factor seemed to be important for at least some of the anti-depressant effects of ketamine both in the days and weeks following ketamine Administration and in addition to that I described how ketamine impacts the opioid receptor system and how we simply cannot Overlook the involvement of the opioid receptor system in producing the anti-depressant effects of ketamine and we also talked about the brain circuits and the brain waves associated with dissociative States and the depression relief that seems to arrive for many people who take ketamine and I tried to highlight some of the unique features of ketamine first of all that it does seem to provide depression relief where other approaches have not but that the depression relief tends to be pretty short-lived unless it's applied in this multi- times per week over multiple weeks kind of fashion to produce what I call durable changes which almost certainly involve changes in neuroplasticity that is rewiring of brain circuits and another key point that I highlighted is that we always have to remember that when thinking about how chemicals like ketamine or any other substance for that matter can modify brain circuits in order to change them and provide relief from depression or some other psychiatric challenge that always always always there is a requirement for engaging in anti-depressive behaviors as a way to further reinforce whatever positive changes have come about through the drug treatment as a friend and colleague of mine who's expert in this area once so aptly said Better Living Through Chemistry still requires Better Living thank you for joining me for today's discussion about ketamine if you're learning from and or enjoying this

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Tony Hawk Tony Hawk is one of the most celebrated and accomplished professional skateboarders of all time for more than 40 years he has been at the Forefront of the sport and I don't mean just doing a sport for more than 40 years I truly mean he has been at the Forefront of skateboarding developing new Maneuvers AKA tricks that include incredible Feats like the 900 and 900 degree spin in the air as well as numerous other Maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward he's also completely popularized the sport through his video game and through his ambassadorship for skateboarding in fact few if any names are synonymous with skateboarding in the general public as Tony Hawk and he is oh so deserved of that title because for more than 40 years he has shown up as the consummate professional he is kind he is respectful and he is completely committed to his craft and that shows up in every aspect of his life he still to this day skateboards daily and as you'll soon learn he recently suffered a major injury a complete break of his femur that is the bone in his upper leg and this is what many people would consider a career-ending injury not only did Tony come back from that injury but he went back to the very trick on which he broke his femur and recently completed that trick that is a 540 or so-called mitt twist I mentioned this because at every level of his life Tony has demonstrated himself to be somebody with Incredible Drive incredible vision and incredible persistence and today we talk about that dry vision and persistence and we talk about what it takes to set a goal and to continually evolve one's goal and to continually progress as a basically young pre-teen as a teenager as a young adult as an adult and well let's face it as a 55 year old man he is now heading a little bit past middle age although we do hope that he lives forever Tony Hawk AKA The Birdman really does seem to be superhuman but as you learned today he is oh so human in the way that he shares his own experience and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all look at what we do and think about what we want to achieve and put our minds and our bodies to those goals and Achieve them I confess that today's discussion with Tony Hawk was a particularly thrilling one for me to have I grew up in the sport of skateboarding so I had met Tony previously although he doesn't remember it that was many years ago in fact I met his parents you'll learn more about that story during today's episode but I was aware of course of Tony's accomplishments I was also aware of his philanthropy so he has a skatepark Foundation I also listened to his podcast with another professional skateboarder Jason Ellis called Hawk vs wolf we provided a link to that podcast in the show note captions as well but never before have I had the opportunity to sit down and talk to the Tony Hawk and learn from him so I was absolutely delighted to have this conversation and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium but no sugar the electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health physical health and performance even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think our energy levels and our physical performance element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration and it does so by including the three electrolytes in the exact ratios they need to be present I drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up I usually mix it with about 16 to 32 ounces of water if I'm exercising I'll drink one while I'm exercising and I tend to drink one after exercising as well many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we don't want to consume sodium in excess however for people that have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are

tracked your career for a very long time grew up in the skateboard thing I I know had your poster on my wall oh thank you your name is synonymous with skateboarding as you know I think a question that probably get asked from time to time but let's just clarify the data from the outset Tony Hawk is your real name right yes Anthony Frank Hawk but I never went by Anthony I mean my parents call me Tony since I could remember so it's a fitting name given the sport and what you do and we will get into this a little bit later when we talk about family and parenting and parents um but I'll allude to the story now that uh when I was 14 years old your parents took me in yeah I slept in your bed in your home so wild not with you in it but surrounded by your a near infinite number of trophies and and um it must have been right after I moved out so this would be I was 14 years old maybe I'll just tell the story now very briefly I was 14 years old I was at a contest at Linda Vista Boys Club everyone left me and another kid named Billy Waldman uh we're still there your dad said where where are you going um it was clear that I didn't know where I was going my life was I was a wayward youth at that time and so they took me in for uh a night maybe even two nights your mom uh Nancy and your dad Frank were so gracious brought me in into your home took me to dinner um I mean that tracks that would definitely my dad and my mom together would be doing that yes incredible people um and we'll get back to that story later because you and I actually met uh the next day in Fallbrook at your ramp but so it had been 88 89 that's right I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 89. okay and it must have been one of the either NSA or Castle contests yeah that your dad was very active in well we'll get back to that but uh I have so many questions that relate to skateboarding to you and really as a neuroscientist to the whole concept of a life of continual progression because but they're not people listening to this and watching this are skateboarders or not and I imagine that most of them are not it's absolutely clear that you've been in this game a very long time and that you've somehow managed to continue to progress over and over to come back from very severe injuries and somehow keep getting better and better so the first question I have is about the younger version of you um did you have any sort of self-concept like you know I want to be a pro athlete or I want to be a skateboarder or I want to have a video game named after me right right exactly um you know but if you can think back to maybe even pre-skateboarding do you remember what your self-concept was you know this notion of like um I have a self and I'm either similar or different to other kids in some way when I was young I was put in a lot of advanced classes and not that that felt like a badge of honor it felt more like I was just classified as a nerd but then I thought okay well that's my strength so I'll lean into that and I thought that maybe I would be a teacher because I thought well I I get all these Concepts and I think I could relate them to kids or to my peers because I helped a lot of my classmates through some of some classes so that's all I really had I didn't know and then when I would play sports I would I would be okay you know I wasn't I wasn't terrible but I wasn't the VIP or the MVP and so I was just kind of playing basketball playing uh baseball um and then when I found skateboarding I mean it was it was pretty obvious that that was what I wanted to do it was once once I got on a skateboard and realized that I could maneuver it and do things that were unique and now they're moving the needle or anyone cared but they were unique in the sense of like I didn't I've never seen anyone do this and this feels awesome and so I just want to do this and so I didn't think that this is my career I was 10. so I just thought this is this is my phone this is my hobby this is this is my thing um and I don't want to play these other sports anymore did you stop playing all the others yes I I quit I quit little league in the middle of the season when my dad had been appointed president of that chapter of Little League because he was the coach he was always very involved in all of his kids I have three siblings so he was always very supportive whatever they were doing and then when I was playing baseball he became a coach because he had time and he was doing that he was he was you know almost retired um and then he was such a prominent figure in the Little League they said oh you're president now and so then someone else was coach and then I was skating and I was over it did you immediately start skateboarding in the parks on transition as we say or were you pushing around in the driveway like most kids it was I was transportation and skating was kind of a fad so I started in 78 roughly maybe 77 even and it was kind of a fad so kids just had skateboards and they would they would all cruise around you know like it was the 70s so everyone had a bike right and you knew wherever all the kids were because the bikes were in the front lawn and then at some point that kind of turned into skating so everyone had skateboards they're all like shitty you know uh JCPenney or Big Box store skateboards no one had really good ones not in my area um but then at some point we were just looking at these magazines of people skating and everyone's skating in pools because that was the Dogtown and Z-Boys era and it was like these guys are flying I wanna like where do we do that and then the skate park opened up in San Diego that was Del Mar's Cooper uh okay Oasis Oasis skatepark was the first one in our area actually I take that back Spring Valley was the first skate park I tried to go there and I was nine and you had to be 10. and I remember like sitting in the parking lot looking over the fence and my dad didn't realize what they ate because my dad would have easily lied for me but he didn't realize there was an age limit and he said how old is he nine oh sorry he can't come and then they closed not long after so when I never got to Spring Valley um because I I think of you as synonymous with Del Mar skate Ranch sure well that was that came later because Oasis skate park was opened up so this was when I first went was like 78. uh a friend of mine was going and he said I want to go to the skate park so I had to go get you know this is such a hassle like I had to go get the authorization form I had to get it notarized by the bank for my parents like to go there and then I went and it was that was my Epiphany when I first saw people flying around in person I was like this is what I'm doing for as long as I could possibly do it because it looked it looked like magic it really did it looked like they were flying on magic carpets and and it spoke to me in the sense of being a daredevil but also doing it individually not relying on my team not um getting hassled by a coach it was just like oh I can be part of the scene but do it my own way and then uh I skated Oasis as much as I could whenever I get your rides there and um then my parents moved to North County San Diego when I was in high school um mostly because they were just chasing kind of real estate deals and uh and so I got lucky that Dome our skate Ranch was right there every other Park closed but Del Mar skate Ranch remained open so I mean there was a bit of luck to all that and it was based on geography your dad's involvement is interesting because I got into skateboarding because you know my dad wasn't around that much at that time a lot of kids getting skateboarding because it doesn't require parent involvement was it unusual to have parental involvement at that stage yeah I mean I remember Frank and by the way I remember Frank and Nancy your parents with was with such fondness not just because they took me in but I remember thinking like there they were at times the only point of stability in a landscape of like 200 people where as you know there could be potential chaos of any kind and your dad had this way of moving about like he wasn't afraid I recall that he wasn't afraid to say what he thought like hey don't do that like impose some regulation at this contest and at the same time it seemed me also understood that this was a sport unlike other sports like you're not gonna regulate kids like me at the time or you're not going to try and control people so what was it like to have your dad involved and the reason I ask is that you're a parent we'll talk more about parenting but also it seems that he went from saying okay you know little league other sports which is more typical to okay this kind of unusual sport skateboarding but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited or motivated enough to take you around to these places um that's pretty special I mean that's pretty it was I mean and in that respect it was great to have his support and and to rely on him for that the fact that he was always around and he was in charge of a lot of the events that that sucked because because it just marked me um as one being favorited um and spoiled um and and most of my friends their parents didn't want them skating so even though they were stoked that my dad had was was doing this kind of thing and giving that kind of support they still were like your Dad's here like this is our thing this is our scene this is our getaway from our parents well I I didn't really have a choice in the matter I did I did at some point tell him my my concerns and my frustrations with it but he didn't really want to hear it you know he was he was very much steadfast like well I'm I'm been coming this far like you can we can keep our distance at these events but people are relying on me to organize them and so I just had to suck it up for a while did it push you harder like you know if you could prove yourself with a skateboarding that you didn't have to worry about any claims of favoritism because ultimately you can't fake you can't fake Escape right right I mean there's no deep fake version of skateboarding you know you either can do it or you can't do it and it's shown in real time so um and I suppose back then I recall you were quite a bit skinny or skinnier oh yeah I had I had all kinds of things going against me at the time yeah I mean I don't think people will realize this unless they've met you in person but nowadays there are a few taller skateboarders out there because the Sports grown so much um but you're pretty tall you're like six six three but okay I was not when I was growing when I was that age I was very small um and kind of concerningly small Because by the time I got to be 16 I was still I looked like I was 13. I used to get pulled over I literally like I had a car that I bought with my earnings I had a Honda Civic 1977 cvcc and I would get pulled over and then the cops would be like how old are you again 16. like well you look like you were 13 back there um and then I shot up around age 17. okay so that's interesting and we can get back to this when we talk about your almost remarkable levels of ability to recover from physical injuries because um well I'll just share a little bit of a biological Theory here which is that you know there are a lot of people that study longevity and perhaps the fastest rate of Aging that we ever undergo is puberty right if you think about a kid before puberty kid after abuse different human being psychologically often physically as well some people have a longer Arc of puberty than others and that does seem to correlate with a longer life and so it's kind of interesting you know some kids hit puberty and they go through all the markers of puberty in like one summer right other kids it's very very long and it sounds like we don't have to talk about when you hit puberty and the other markers but it sounds like your growth spurt occurred late oh yeah that's a terrific marker of a long life by the way because what it reflects is the onset of a big burst of growth hormone out of the pituitary in the brain and if you continue to grow for a long period of time that indicates you know it gives you a little bit of the slope of the line does that make sense oh yeah so um this this may um have important and fortunate consequences so at 17 you shot up am I correct in Remembering uh maybe you said it maybe somebody else did that you were um forgive me but so skinny when you were a kid that you actually wore elbow pads as knee pads yeah yeah that's a true that's a true story for sure and and I took inspiration from others that that I identified with namely Steve Caballero because he was already an established Pro when I started to come up in the ranks or even get noticed at all and he was wearing elbow pads on his knees in this full-page picture of him and Winchester doing a back sitter and I was like that I want to do that and he's small and I feel like that's my goal yeah like if he can do that I can do it it was just more like oh this I identify with that and and that gives me hope um and as I recall Stevie also has a pretty severe scoliosis right like at one point Julius what he has at one point he was turned turned pretty pretty tight to the to the right or left I don't recall which I mean still incredible skateboarder loves TV he's a NorCal guy so yeah I grew up I know whatever he had is from birth but um but it was more that his size and I didn't even know he was he many not many but you know he's like four years older than me um so I just was like oh there's small guys doing that I can do it maybe but when I got tall when I went through puberty suddenly I had all these tricks and then suddenly I had the strength and the the height that gave me confidence and so all of a sudden it was like oh I can go way higher now and I'm comfortable with these tricks these intricate board Maneuvers and stuff so that was a huge advantage to me um the the smaller Stuff felt different after that which was harder um but being able to blast AFI in the air as opposed to four feet in the air was a huge Advantage yeah isn't that wild when the nervous system knows how to do something and then your body changes and you can do the same thing but with so much more Force even the bowls look smaller when I would stand on top I was like wait this isn't that big it's wild well the reason I ask about this I think you know people listening generally seem to assume that you know if you become a Stanford Professor or become a professional skateboarder or you a professional soccer player that that you were just fated to become that right and it's clear that it's the Confluence of so many different factors um but one of the consistent factors for sure is a sense that you just really love doing it right I mean I can't imagine getting you know proficient or excellent at anything without loving doing it right and so still at this time when you were let's say um 14 15 um did you have any concept of you know whatever pro model I'm gonna none of that well there was there was none of that to be had so we didn't have these great aspirations because no one had really done that before there were you could have some success yes you could have maybe a signature model but even the top sales of skateboarding then wasn't a career the prize money was 150 for first place 100 for second 50 for third couple tanks of gas some food yeah so let's put it this way I turned Pro when I was 14. by the time I was 15 and a half and I had a learner's permit and I could drive a scooter you know I had 600 in my bank account and I used that to buy a Honda Express uh moped for a year and a half that was my earnings was six hundred dollars so clearly money wasn't the uh the dopamine hit it was the it was the actual skateboard sure and that's what I mean though there wasn't there was no goal of that because it just didn't exist so I didn't care like getting I I have my own vehicle at age 15 like I was living large I can get to the skate park on my own that was amazing to be 14 and be a professional at anything must be um a trip so to speak um but what I'm wondering about because I came up when um your early cohort with Paul Peralta so for those that don't know so-called Bones Brigade right I guess it was a total what like six seven guys there were someone that were a little more peripheral than others um they're about six seven core guys um in the various videos I mean you guys were famous right you had posters um on kids walls who skateboarded there was a second or maybe it was a third surge of popularity and skateboarding um because it would sort of surge in general popularity than disappear and come back as it has over decades it keeps coming and going um to some extent did you have a conscious awareness of just how you know how much attention was being placed on you know photos of you videos of you and I'm just wondering about the younger version of you whether or not you know you realize what was happening and the reason I ask is because you've always seemed to me somebody who through interviews through videos through our interactions and for those who have known you much longer than I have um just very grounded like not caught up in it um you know we've never seen headlines about you kind of just you know blowing all your money or you know wrecking cars and you know destroying your life I mean I'm sure you've made mistakes like any of us but but you seem to have avoided a lot of the pitfalls of quote unquote famous people and celebrities and yet you were a famous person from a very young age I well I think it was that I didn't never I never that was never a goal and then when I had a sense of it I was very uncomfortable I mean I was happy I was happy to be successful I was happy that people recognized me that that was amazing just because I was good at skateboarding I never imagined something like that um and but I was always very I mean some people thought that I was sort of almost like pompous or arrogant because I wasn't interacting because I was just I was walled up I was like I don't know what to do I don't know this is the last words I would ever use to describe you I think it was just more that that that people would see me like I go to a ramp I didn't know anybody and I would just start skating and I'd do all my stuff and they were like oh he doesn't even talk to anyone and I was like I don't know I don't know what to do I don't know how to act also you were 14 years old so Stacy broke me out of that because I remember one time there was a kid that was just staring at me like hold my skateboard he had my signature model and he said go say hi to that guy what are you sure like he wants he wants to interact with you you know just go high five of them or anything and and I learned to sort of break out of my comfort zone by doing that enough um but my first go around I mean that was that was sort of my first uh wave of Fame I'd say the Bones Brigade years and we are so young that we thought this is forever and so we were definitely careless with our our money with our actions and um and at some point my dad saw that he didn't think it was going to be long term because no one had had a long-term career right so he he uh encouraged me to to invest to get property like to buy a house that was the that was my Saving Grace because I definitely was spending on cars and things like that uh yeah car like kind of a little bit beyond my means I wasn't really considering all my money was was 10.99 income so it wasn't we weren't paying taxes on anything and at the end of the year it would be like oh you owe this much like wait what are you talking about so um for instance hey do you want to go to Hawaii yeah okay invite everyone we're all going to Hawaii I got well let's rent a place okay you know and it was on me because I had the means you mentioned Stacy we should probably clarify for people um Tony's referring to the great Stacy Peralta yeah he was he was the one who put me on the Bones Brigade when I was still considered sort of a circus act like a you know my my skating was not really established the stuff that I was doing was largely made fun of because people thought that what I was doing was just more like a free show can you explain more so my and let me just tell you that my recollection first recollection of you that I still have that image in my mind would um is the finger flip error right you know so for folks that aren't familiar with skateboarding you know people ride around on transition or in the street handrails stairs you know people probably familiar with all those things but um skateboards will Riot up toward the top of the pool of the ramp and they'll do something on the so-called lip or the coping that's to ride at the the edge of it or they'll go above it like in the air but I recall seeing you do the finger flip error I've never seen anyone flip a board in the air I've seen people do varial so right move it it's going to be complicated for people just listening but just flip it upside down and then catch it in and finger flip error yeah that was I remember that was a jaw drop right it was like so if that was considered circus era or circus uh like then I don't know I don't know what it was being compared to because at the time we we probably watched that it was in slow motion as I recall and we probably watched it three thousand times you know that summer there's a big group of us that all starts skateboarding that summer um I would say kind of just before that in that window is when people were were more um giving me Flack for what I was doing because I was mostly doing board variation stuff but I still didn't have the height the height in terms of the height in terms of in terms of getting in the air yeah so I was doing all this stuff kind of right at coping level and so people weren't taking it into consideration or giving it much Merit because it was just like oh he's doing a little board twist or a bar turn and then when I started to get some height around the time you saw and started doing those tricks like visibly way up high that's when the the the shift happened in terms of more acceptance but I was still labeled as a as like a trick skater robot skater and then you had Christian osoy who was all Style air is higher than anyone anytime he did a trick it was going to be so flashy and so amazing and Rockstar personality and Rockstar personality and so in that era you I mean it was very divided it was like no one liked us both you know what I mean it was just so strange to be of that age and of doing something that had never really been established and then suddenly I'm pitted against another skater and we're just trying to make our way through 15 years and and skateboarding and and um it got it was it was hard I mean it was like I got I got bullied you know yes I was successful yes I was you but but I would get I would get uh Thrasher magazine would talk about my performance when I would win yeah I remember that because I was from Northern California and Thrasher magazine was a Skateboard Magazine from Northern California actually wrote for them for a while when I was a postdoc to make some extra money uh under a different name folks but you can try and find those articles they're out there um and then in Southern California it was skateboarder mag Transworld mostly Transworld skateboarding yeah it was a trans World transport skateboarding and Thrasher magazine were there were the two the rivals right yeah um so yeah I recall um some of those things that were said um it just is amazing to me um but it brings about a really important lesson which is you know that kid that gets made fun of if they're determined and they love what they're doing that's going to be the kid that blows everyone away later and I know this for sure because I'll never forget there do you remember the back to the city contest that were called in San Francisco so I went to those they were in the drain fountains in front of City Hall I remember getting there one day and there was this guy with kind of like afro-like hair pushing around he was doing what are called daffies he had two skateboards he was kind of like weaving around and I remember thinking you know San Francisco's other its issues now but back then it was rough also for different reasons I remember thinking like this guy is going to get beat up I hung out with the Embarcadero crew I was like this guy's gonna get beat down yeah that guy was Mark Gonzalez oh yeah so one of the greatest perhaps the greatest Street skateboarder if you can't really Define these things greatest and whatnot in skateboarding um but you know I remember thinking this guy's just he's a kook and then I realized who it was and then I realized he was just like any other kid there at some level and then a lot of the kids that got teased early on they stuck with it five years later I'm singing them in the magazines and I think about this with podcasting too there have been some podcasters they've reached out early on and had questions and you know look at their stuff and you know one's initial impression can be like what are they like what are they doing here and then you just see them two years later three years later and they're doing amazingly well and you're like this guy or gal is here for good they're gonna they're probably gonna be top of the game in a few years so you never count anybody out when you would go to sleep at night in that era were you like laying on the pillow going like oh my God people hate me there's stuff in the magazines I gotta push harder this is hard did you talk to your dad about it I mean again it's a lot to Bear even as an adult I can only imagine what it's like to bear as a 15 year old kid I didn't really have a support group you know or any resource to to voice those concerns um I just knew I wanted to keep getting better that was it and so if anything if I was worried about those voices if I was worried about the whatever take people had on me I knew I was going to go back to the skate park and learn more tricks um and at some point I had so much of that as a foundation that it was sort of undeniable that like well he can do all this stuff and he doesn't just do it at his home park um and I think that's probably when the tide turned for me is when when I started to do well at other events um namely Upland pipeline which was for the most part the most frightening pool that we could ride the thing was big but I also recall like the the hips as they're called like the transitions the way they match up super tight a lot of her giant coping super rough like if you fell in Upland you're getting shoot up it's pulling your knee pads down but I didn't know that because from the photos I wouldn't know that oh it was it was treacherous it really was like it was and and I wanted to do well at the event and I would drive up there every weekend like my friend uh Greg Smith was a freestyler but he lived near Upland and so I would go drive Friday after school straight to Upland skate at night skate Saturday all day skate Sunday uh early and then drive home um because I live in San Diego and I just made it my mission to to figure that thing out because that was The Proving Ground for me um Emma and so if I could skate that I could go get anything as many of you know I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012. so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational

trying tricks and the English anxiety associated with it did you did you and do you have a sort of systematic process was it you know I'm going to learn the basics first like did you say that do you say I'm okay I'm going to learn how to do stuff you know at coping level then I'm gonna do a little error then I'm gonna go bigger I'm gonna do this or um did you just sort of um try what you wanted to try and you obviously weren't haphazard about it like how it seems you're pretty systematic about exploring what's possible and then pushing forward little by little but um yeah maybe you could talk a little bit about how you have conceptualized okay tomorrow I want to try this um it comes in different forms but for the most part I think about how I could combine existing tricks and would this trick work going into this trick and could your body position shift or would it all work in unison and when I approach a new trick I'm saying I'm saying more in the last 20 years my thought process is I have all the pieces to this I've done every bit of it I've done that I've done the first part of the trick in another form I've done the second part or the grinding of it or whatever usually in some other basic way and then the landing is well the landing is from whatever that is and if you can throw all those things together and make the timing work it's gonna work and I I never I never went at something with some Hazard approach or throwing caution to the wind like hope this see what happens it's always very much like I know I have all these things and so I just have to put them together and I mean now things are so technical that my same approach that I'm doing hundreds of times one of them just works and it's not because I didn't it's not because I committed to that one it's because of some tiny fractional adjustment that happened that I didn't even know happen and it just worked and I mean that kind of is the curse of what tricks are now because there are plenty of moves that I've done over the last 10 years even that I I only did once because it was too hard to get to and I didn't learn from that one make and that that is that's hard to accept because in the past I was learning tricks to have them in my Arsenal that I could just throw them down at a competition or a demo I've got that in my pocket these days like that trick for instance I did a I did a 360 shove it five out of fakie all right let's let's break that down for real 360 shove it so who's gonna take this on I'll let you take this on I can try it from my knowledge and perspective but whatever 360 shove it is pushing the board with your feet and letting it spin a full 360 rotation under your feet in the landing back on it it's it's a trick that people do on usually on flat ground I've learned I've learned to do it up on the vert walls like I could do 360 shove its kind of in the air but I'm doing that I'm doing a 360 job and then I'm landing on my truck right like the axle Between the Wheels on one axle in a what we call a 5-0 position which is basically a wheelie on the truck so everything is so precise I got to do 367 at exactly a certain spot on the wall I've got to catch it so that my truck lands when my foot hits it I can't push it into the truck because that that screws up my balance so it has to land on the truck I have to land with my weight perfectly set back enough that I can come in backwards because I'm doing this trick and and I'm I'm gonna come in fakie right 360 show 50 to coming in forward is is a whole different Beast that that I could probably do that just in a few tries but the idea that I have to land on this thing balance on it like a teeter-totter and then reverse my energy and come in fakie backwards it's so hard it's so hard to to get into the right position so like any time I try it there's like a one in ten chance I'm even gonna get into the position I need and that's the one I have to commit to so every time I do it it's so intense and it takes so much so much commitment and so much mind I don't even know how to explain it like the the that you have shut everything else out except this one moment and this one fractional piece that you have to make work and it I've done it once and I like I would love to do it again but I know what it's gonna it's gonna take the same amount of effort I didn't learn from that one that I made some trick that makes it happen every time it's all so Technical and there's so many things that can go wrong that all is accepted okay I did it once in thinking about the 360 show at 50 fakie uh was that something that you thought of the night before you decide that day do you ever use visualization have you ever had learning come to you in a dream or find that you try try something went to sleep that night next day made it anything like that yes sometimes I'll wake up the middle of night and I'll write down something because it was like oh there's this trick oh I think I could do that yeah okay let me write it down so you dream about skateboarding from time to time yeah well yeah that shifted a bit after I got hurt but yeah I used to dream that I can't skate like I'm trying and that it feels like the ramps made of carpet I can't get the speed I can't get the timing and then as I went through this traumatic injury my dreams shifted to wow I can skate I can do all my tricks again oh interesting yeah a little uh piece of science around the can't uh can't skate piece or when people feel like they're bolted down in a dream or they can't run away yeah there's this one phase of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep where the brain is very active the dreams associated with it tend to be very Vivid and at the same time we are completely paralyzed and the idea is that no one really knows why but that it's the case that we're paralyzed to prevent us from acting out our dreams it's also an interesting neurochemical phenomenon because during these rapid eye movement dreams they tend to be very intense but the body can't release adrenaline so it's almost like its own form of trauma therapy it's like you're experiencing this intense thing in your mind but your body can't react and so oftentimes people uh have argued that that's why you feel like you want to move and you can't because actually can't yeah some people have woken up while still a bit paralyzed and REM have you ever had that happen we wake up but actually a couple of my kids have have struggled with that a couple times yeah REM interference is called it's not dangerous and usually people can jolt themselves out but it's kind of terrifying so that's interesting so we'll get to a discussion about the the recent injury and thankfully recovery from the injury not miraculous because that makes it seem as if it's surprising frankly I'm not surprised that you've recovered but it is um spectacular uh the way you have but you're saying that in your dreams before the injury you would think about skateboarding but you felt like there was a kind of can't do it when I was doing it in my dream there was always some roadblock that I just cut like why can't I get any speed why can't I why can't I snap or do this trick um it's more in the moments where it's Twilight moments where I'm kind of awake and I'm thinking about tricks that everything else Falls away and I can actually focus on what kind of new moves to come up with um an example of that was uh recently I went to the X Games in Japan a few weeks ago and I was thinking I was going to go more to show my support and because they had a Verge event there's not a lot of bird events anymore so if there's a vert event it's kind of like if you build it I will come because I want to show my support that's that's kind of where my heart is and they had a best trick event and I thought man maybe I could get in the best trick is there anything new though you know and I'm still recovering from my leg and then at some point I was falling asleep and I thought oh I could do that trick and come in 180. I know I could do that with with my current state and not getting that much speed so to explain what I was doing is is a half cab body rail to Backside blunt okay we can walk through this half cab has come up backwards come with 360. right so half an hour ago as I approach the top of the ramp I body rail that means I jump around and then I jump around on my board and then I make sure that it lands with my two trucks out and my tail on the coping which is very precarious and I've done that and come in fakey beef that's the blunt piece that's the blunt so I've done that right where you and then you have to you have to use your B to lift up the board come in fakie right I've done that I've done that twice and I thought well I wonder if there's something I could do like that and then I realized that if I just keep coming around and I come in backside direction that keeps my body spinning and that might actually be easier it wasn't but I figured it out I think I saw a clip of this honest I did it yeah I mean I did it I did it X Games and I was like it was my last run I was it was I mean it didn't move the needle I got seven plays but for me it was a huge moment it felt amazing I bet oh yeah for sure I mean and it was I mean it was like weeks of preparation and trying to figure this thing out I made it twice before the event um on my own alone on my ramp but um that's just an example of of you know I was I was literally falling asleep and then all of a sudden I was like half cup body well back to blunt I love it that liminal State between wakefulness and sleep is such a beautiful state that if one is open to ideas showing up there yeah they almost always do I try to start trying it the next morning do you ever find that when you're taking walks or in the shower or not thinking about skateboarding yeah it's usually in the in the sort of mundane moments that that I get inspiration yeah do you have practices for Pure relaxation aside from socialization I know I was never I think that's something I've been lacking I I never was good at warming up stretching post-warm up um or or or relaxing you know meditation nothing I just I I go skate and it's on um and as I've gotten older I realize that's not the best technique but it's worked so far it has worked um so for you it's Go Hopefully a little bit of warm up if you I have more of a sort of OCD warm-up run that I use to gauge how I'm feeling but I kind of have to get through that like a surgeon when a surgeon's about to do a surgery um they don't warm up they just check off the various boxes of you know this is here that's there make sure that they're comfortable in their environment and then they do they do the life-saving work yeah yeah I'd say my warm-up run is is kind of basic tricks but they give me a sense of how how stiff or how I what I need to adjust for it for the rest of the day so I guess it's not so OCD but it but I definitely feel like I gotta go through that routine what feels the best like I I know that making a new trick feels incredible especially if you've been at it a long time dialing it in so that you can do it again and again is its own form of reward yeah um but what is the maybe list of two or three things that just feels so good well that for sure learning new tricks not even that it's something that I created but just doing something that I've never done before when I first learned varials backside burials no one had done backside barrels before they'd only done on the front side um and a variable is where you you reach down grab your board jump in the air and then turn at 180 under your feet it's it's like a shove it but you're guiding with your hand I learned that halfway up the pool the main pool in a way at oasis with no one around and the feeling I got when I rode away was something that I had never experienced and then it is it is literally the buzz that I've been chasing ever since because it was like I created something various below coping was that was the button that was it it really was and if you saw a video of it you'd be like that thing like what can I say it was it was the first time that I thought I thought of it um I I went through all the Motions of it I did the work and I figured it out and you know no one no one cared but at some point I was able to do it six feet in the air and do a full 360 variable and so that was the building block but but that feeling was like no other um I'd say that and then just even to to strip everything else away like the most basic tricks like a backside Ollie is is an a no-handed aerial that used to be what it was called backside no handed Ariel it feels so good because even to this day people people say how does the boys stay on your feet and I can't even tell you how the board sits on my feet I just know I know how to maneuver it and I know how to keep the pressure on it and the friction going and backside always is like I think it's like a Marvel of physics and and a clean back say to me it feels good as anything yeah it's a beautiful thing to behold I confess I've never done a legitimate backside at all I ever on a mini ramp sure but not on vert so I can't relate to the feeling but I love love love the fact that you brought us back to that early variable below coping feeling and that that marks the essence of what feels so good when you do something else right it's sort of like a it's a as a neuroscientist I see it as a chemical stamp it's like a chemical fingerprint of progress right um and I'm also delighted to hear that it still feels that good to do these things because I don't think anyone can have the kind of lifelong progression that you've had and it's still going uh without a not just love of the thing but love of the feeling that it brings when no one's around because you said Skating your ramp by yourself so how often are you on your ramp with you know no one's filming for Instagram no nothing for a video nothing for a video game none of that maybe there's you know maybe other guys are around gals around we'll talk about gals too because one of the big shifts in skateboarding since I started is that there's some amazing female skateboarders now um there's a young lady in fact that's been skateboarding at your ramp forgive me I can't remember her name is it Reese Reese Nelson goodness goodness gracious I know she is so yeah good so good so good uh so we'll get back to that but I think that you know people starting any kind of sport or academic career or business or anything I think people assume that you go from zero to a hundred somehow and that there are these people that are just selected by genetics or by Locker by some combination of things to just like get it and be better than everybody else but it's clear that you've spent a lot of time alone driving someplace to skate the next day or alone at the ramp yeah or um so do you ever reflect on that kind of Drive um and you know what what what that's all about or is it just so intrinsic to who you are innate I don't I don't think about it I just know I have to do it it's like I mean I I we can get into it with my injury but um uh but but to go back to what you're saying is you're saying that people think that oh you were chosen for this or genetics whatever have you saw your last names yeah when I first started skating there was no way you'd think that I was natural or that I had any future in it I was all gangly I was all over the place I was eating left and right like it just it wasn't I wasn't good I wasn't I wasn't a natural um I've seen people that are Naturals and I've seen that how they don't have that drive they don't have the discipline and it's not wasted but they just don't they don't utilize they don't take advantage of what they have naturally and and for whatever reason I don't I don't fault anyone for it um but I've seen both sides of it and I've also seen other skaters who are just driven and who are not really good kind of sloppy and become the best Andrew Reynolds oh yeah when we put him on our team he was just like me super gangling his boards bouncing around but he's trying every single trick and every time he send me a video you know some new technique that he's figured out and he didn't really by the untrained eye he didn't have the skill set for and then he became the boss you know what I mean so I think it's just you you have to you have to give that as much weight as natural tone if not more I'd say more yeah I would certainly say more for Science and you know that people were in the lab late at night and early in the morning and drilling away not not always the smartest certainly not the um dumbest but smart enough to show up when other people are leaving and continue and I think there has to be a little bit of friction internally I mean you know maybe maybe externally also but just some friction some I'm gonna show you yeah yes okay my best example of that and I haven't talked about this yet um because I did it privately but I I broke my leg doing a mixed with something that I've done thousands of times in my 40. 540. yeah so it's it's a one and a half spin in the backside Direction but that particular grab that you do makes it a Twist because it makes you kind of flip upside down so it's kind of a one and a half somersault I it's not my tricks Mike McGill's trick I learned it not long after he created it in 1984. been doing it ever since I mean I'm talking about 40 Years of me twist right I've gotten hurt once or twice but not bad anyway I around and found out did one with no speed last year thinking I could do it like I was still 20 and got tangled up and broke my femur I had a super long recovery I had a false start I had a non-union fracture which means my bone never connected back to itself and it kept pushing itself further away um and that's all uh in the past I've got a second surgery in November and all along in the back of my head is I got to get back to 540s I have to and I can't explain why I have to I hate that it means that much to me but it it's in here you know I mean it's not it's not a sense of Pride it's not like I have to prove this to anyone I just have to do it and last week I did it it was so scary and I prepped for it I I mean even down to like my diet and I I stopped drinking altogether and I was like every time I go to the ramp I'm just trying 540s like to get the spin to get the to get the landing Zone with no intention to make yet just that I had to get there and then I had to have this heart to heart with my wife that you know she doesn't want to see me get hurt she doesn't see me risking myself at this age anymore she doesn't want to live through another traumatic injury with me and I had to tell her like I have to do this she was gracious and accepting and that's all I could ask for it wasn't like she was like yeah you got to go do it it was like okay that's who you are and so she was there she was my only spectator so good I confess I've seen a video of this and my first response was um f yes and my second response was that was really high like this is no you know just above coping 540. this isn't even you know this is a head high 540. I'm not gonna make the same mistake I did last time where I tried it low thinking I just get away with it anymore so the going high was more of a safety measure which is ironic the the bigger the ramps for me the safer it is because I have a better Landing Zoom I have more time in the air to adjust and even though it looks spectacular and Music Experience it's just like no I need that I can't skate some eight foot pool I have no Landing zone I'm Too Tall I'm too I move too slowly now to do that kind of stuff so that's why you don't see me like in the Park events and stuff like that you know you're going to see me on this 14-foot boat ramp because that's my happy place and that's where I'm safe um but also having my wife there I just knew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front of her because I would have been such trouble the the emotional support and pressure is uh is a real thing and in the best ways uh not to focus on the bad aspects of the injury because there are planning yeah that I recall you and I communicated not long after the let's say let's call it what it was the first break and I remember you said to me over text you said how long before I'm skateboarding again and I said um skateboarding as in pushing or skateboarding as in um what you do on vert you know and you said uh what I do on vert and I said well it seems you are doing a lot of things you were doing deliberate cold delivery heat pressure you do a number of things I mean you're not haphazard about your career and your body and your health we'll get into that a little bit later some of the things that you've enjoyed as beneficial for you but um you said I'm calling it at two months and I said okay um I believe it and then I recall that you was it the Oscars or some other award event where you came out about a week later you came out there uh you walked out this broken femur and you weren't using any support to walk out so you clearly ditched whatever support you might have been using uh which I think is Awesome by the way um and then pretty soon I was seeing videos of you dropping in I'm seeing videos of you doing kick turns below coping I'm seeing videos of you at coping and you know we have a friend in common the skateboard and generally photographer Mike blaback and I remember texting Mike I was like Tony's back already this is this is superhuman rates of healing and I think it is super human rates of healing then you mentioned that you damaged broke broke the femur again so did you allow more rest the second time what was driving you to get back in it so quickly the first go-around I just didn't listen to any of the professional advice because I thought well I've done I've come this far and I've always been able to push through broken pelvis broken elbow um knee surgeries and I've always been the timeline is always very shortened for me because I just get back out there and I and I get the healing started but I also am comfortable with what people think is extremely risky but in this instance I want to get back out there right away and not long after the Academy Awards uh I was actually walking with a cane at that time and I ditched the cane just to walk out on stage to present the award so that was my big my big coming out moment but it was kind of forced and as soon as I walked out to stay they grabbed my cane and I was hobbling in the backstage um but I was I was skating kind of a mini ramp and and I was already struggling because I couldn't put my weight on my front foot because my bones still had not connected to itself so there's a gap in the bone but there's a there's a nail what they call a nail or you know big piece of metal that's holding them in place but I didn't realize how careful I needed to be with that because it was so precarious and I decided I'm going to drop in on the mini ram like I think I'm ready and and it wasn't the drop in on the main ramp it was me getting to the top of the mini ramp and stepping off my board that's always that kind of stuff but but I just stepped off my board like I would do any other day but I didn't think I led with my front foot and I felt the bone move in that moment I I really I felt it I felt it either twist or get out of place and I was in total denial for months because I just said oh I just it just hurts now like I you know I I got a minor setback and then I finally eight months into my recovery seven months into my recovery I was always in pain my skating wasn't progressing I couldn't get speed and by all measures I should be back at least I'd be back to a level that I feel good about and I went and got x-rays and they said your bone never connected you have a non-union fracture and and and and every time I skated so my bones like this every time I skated I was pushing it further away and so my bone was like this on the last X-ray and and that was the hard truth so for those listening just laterally displaced think about a pipe that's broken in the middle and just one's offset to the other and and as I keep skating and I I could force my skin like I kind of learned this hack where I can put 75 of my weight on my back foot and 25 of my front foot and do what I wanted to do but it wasn't where I thought I'd be and it just hurt all the time I mean it really was like that was my trigger because I I have a pretty high tolerance to pain and it was always her like I I would dread going to the airport knowing I had to walk to a gate so I knew something was wrong there I went to a specialist um that deals in non-union fractures and he had a very pragmatic factual approach and it was like oh I would do this I'm taking that nail out and take the other Hardware out and put it together and you cannot move for two months did you obey that at work I did really yeah so what what is chilling I was not going to risk that again did you um and do you prioritize things like sleep um nutrition um just you know generally and did you emphasize those things while you were recovering from the injury yeah I I was very disciplined in my diet in my schedule and my sleep um surprisingly I I was very busy because um I do speaking engagements and suddenly my speaking engagements were getting booked left and right I mean to the point where I did a tour through Europe Last Summer of speaking engagement so that was that was a silver lining I guess to my my idle time um and I leaned into it you know I made myself available and and uh it you know it's good money and it was it's fun to to interact and um but all through all through that of course in the back of my head I was like when when can I skate when can I skate and then when I finally started skating it was night and day with my leg I felt like I could lean forward suddenly I was learning tricks every every session relearning tricks um so I just I'm just lucky that I got to live in this time of modern medicine was that two months the longest you've ever gone without skateboarding vert yeah yeah without skating at all not even just pushing around yeah good for you for obeying doctor's orders and also finally and also good for you for deciding that your rate of recovery is going to be whatever it is for you because I feel like I'm hearing both things on the one hand you listen to the medical professionals on the other hand I'm not hearing oh you know I looked at the average rate of recovery from this kind of fracture this and that it's it's like it's as if you decided two things at once that there are experts who have something to offer me here I'll follow their advice and yet I'm the expert at myself here I'm putting myself in your first person uh Tony's the expert in Tony and I'm going to make sure that I come back 100 yeah or better yeah not better but um and I've and I have come to terms with that because I know that I'm not going to be pushing myself the way that I did before I got hurt anymore there are some tricks now that are way more difficult just because whatever something changed in my body and for instance I can't grab slob like I can't I I can't do it consistently that used to be my go-to grab you could do that anytime over 60 foot gaps whatever like I could I just grab I knew where my board was I knew that was going to hold on to my feet and half the time I try to grab that way now I don't reach it or I grab my foot instead and I I don't know I can't make the adjustment to fix it and so I've just sort of come to terms with well that's not the go-to grab anymore and that's okay I had a good run yeah your kid's pretty pretty uh vast so there's a lot of other things to reach too aside from the 540 which by the way congratulations not only is it a 540 but uh done at least head high I've seen it with my own eyes and um and under really great circumstances your wife there just the two of you and after and the trick that broke the femur in the first place yeah so um congratulations on that thank you

slaw bears for now yeah um yeah I I want to get my hand plants back the way I used to do them yeah I have yet yeah it's so invert like it's one-handed handstand um I can do them now but I've seen you do them recently yeah but but I used they used to be my signature it was a tucking Amber and flopped all the way back and and I can't get a hold of my board to pull it all the way back like I used to um if I can get that I'll feel like that's it that's that's that was the last Milestone I'm not here to uh diagnose and treat these uh specific uh skateboard trick isms but between your what you said about the slob air and what you're saying about this seems like they're same thing about about getting your your your front hand around and around pulling it back back in uh behind you so maybe this is like the way that the femur is lining up with your pelvis and maybe some off-ramp something or other Physical Therapy could do I'm actually working with um at best core he is a he is a doctor of physical therapy and he has helped me immensely through my recovery and when I'm frustrated with this motion or that's the same grab actually as in the twist he worked on me before it and was just contorting my body and my leg into these positions that I don't really even get to when I'm skating just to prepare me for that and he did but that's what it took it's interesting that we're talking about skateboarding and we're also talking about physical therapists we're talking about nutrition we're talking about sleep so growing up means like none of that none of that never imagined any of this and I'm chuckling because you know growing up in skateboarding um early on for me uh not quite as early as you but pretty early 12 um and got out of it and back and yes I can still do a thing or two uh here and there um but that's not the point the point is that you know the nutrition consisted largely of you know fast food or whatever was around cigarettes and beer were sort of the the energy drinks and uh uh and um supplements of of the times this is fortunately changed but there there was essentially no Health promoting tools or aspects to it at all but that was back then but then over time it seems It's evolved like now I see um I saw a couple posts from Stevie Williams like he's in the gym sure um I think I saw Danny Way early on working with Paul check and doing some balance work neck work because he had broken his neck surfing and things of that sort so there seems to have been a big shift over the last 15 20 years where skateboarders are taking good care of their bodies like other athletes thinking about the resilience of their bodies and also generally taking better care like a lot of them opt not to drink and do drugs and all those sorts of things so I mean how does it strike you to see the way that skateboarding has evolved towards the option to be much healthier and treat it like a like a serious sport where you're a serious athlete a word that you know even 15 years ago 20 years ago if you called a skip order an athlete some people might even be offended by oh yeah people in skateboarding right absolutely yeah um well to answer your question in the early days that was part of the the scene and the culture just because the the it was the antithesis to organize team sports and mainstream culture and so it was just like yeah this is what we do it who cares like we drank and we skate and everyone it was it was Wild West right but as I never fell into that deeply because I saw how it affected people's performances and the skating itself was Paramount to me that is what I want to focus on that's what I want to be good at and I saw people partying and partying their skills away so I had at least that forethought um and then as scanning got more established popular more of a career option than people started taking it more seriously especially competitors I mean and and but there's such a wide swath of of what skateboarding is and it's a big tent so to say that it's more organized yes it's more organized over here there's still all these skaters over here partying hopping fences don't care about contests don't want sponsors oh like GX 1000 like those kids at bomb Hills in San Francisco like like but that that's what I love about it is the diversity of it all and that that's we're all part of this scene so I I was a competitor that was that was my path to success and so I appreciate that people take it more seriously now and that they do have trainer they have resources I mean they have sponsors that will pay for this kind of stuff there was no such thing I mean like at our biggest skate contest we were all staying at Stacy Peralta's parents house the night before and he would take us out to get spaghetti because he thought carbohydrates was going to give us energy the next day that was the extent of training in 1983. right but nowadays it we're treated like High Elite athletes because they are like if you really look at people that are at the top of their field people like Niger Houston you know what I mean like the dude is a machine he is he is one of the most precise skaters that we've ever seen or precise athletes this side of Nadia coming each you know yes I'm I'm I'm aging myself but what I'm saying is like this is this is takes hardcore dedication Precision athleticism and devotion and so now they have the resources to back that up and to keep it going longer I mean yeah would I be able to do this now especially after getting hurt without the help of a doctor of physical training probably not I'd do it on some level but I wouldn't get to where I am now um and so hey I think it's awesome I you know I I never I never wanted to covet skateboarding as this thing that no one else could like a gatekeeper to it no one else can touch it I always thought there was something to skateboarding that was magical and that was good for mental health and that was that was required such um required such passion and I didn't I never understood why I didn't get bigger through those those leaning years it was always like kids this speaks to kids like it's Daredevil and it's active and it's exciting and you can do it as a group but you can do it your own way and I don't know all those things it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out they definitely figured it out I mean nowadays skaters are the cool kids in school yeah it's in the Olympics like there was always discussion would it be it was an exhibition sport in the Olympics at one point no uh no no oh I thought it was it for maybe it had a run it potentially being an exhibition there were there was talk about it got it um but it never did and and not that I mean at some point especially in the late 90s or 2000s skating was getting appreciated and and kind of reached that threshold of of is it mainstream well it's in it's all McDonald's commercials so I guess that's pretty mainstream and so we already had come of age and it was like we don't need the Olympics we're already more popular than a lot of Olympic sports right so why do we need their validation and then at some point it became like the the power Dynamic shifted and it was like oh they need our cool Factor we don't need their validation and I was like yeah okay you guys want it sure go ahead but hold the events hold the qualifiers we'll participate but we don't need this well you've been an amazing Ambassador for the sport that's driven so much of that wider acceptance and progression and invitation into different domains one of the um things that I definitely want to talk about is the video game right because I think that the video game changed a lot of things for the general public in terms of their perception of skateboarding I mean what it allowed of course is this is obvious but it allowed kids that weren't going to you know um bang up their shins or walk in with a broken wrist or you know all skinned up too to do incredible tricks but in silico on a screen right and to and pretend that they are the the pro skateboarder that's essentially what what video games are about And yet when you can see something just like you can imagine it in a dream or while you're falling asleep and you can see something and and hear an air quotes do something in a video game it also is going to inspire a number of kids to go outside and grab a real skateboard and try that or try something like that so clearly the video game was a catalyst for what I consider now the the wide acceptance of skateboarding as a sport in all its various forms um could you just talk for a little bit about the Genesis of the video game were you into video games prior to the video game um were you into technology generally and and what sort of motivated the interest in the video game because it certainly has changed the face of actual skateboarding and the perception of skateboarding um well I've been into video games since the gecko I mean I was a kid you know playing pong Pac-Man Missile Command Qbert you name it and then getting the home systems in television Super NES Commodore 64. um Sega yeah but but I um and I always love technology so when I when I finally started making money in the 80s my first kind of big purchase in terms of that uh in in terms of electronics was uh Commodore Amiga which was considered one of the highest end uh home computers you know alongside Mac but but more graphic oriented and and more game-oriented um and so I was always into that idea that you could do this kind of stuff at home not just in arcades and then I gotta I got a call from a PC programmer that wanted to pitch a skate game and had a crude engine of um a skater that would cruise around go in bowls and stuff like that and it was all keyboard controlled it was clunky but it was something and the last thing that we had as skating was 720 in the arcade or a skate or die for home systems for Commodore 64. that was like the last thing that had happened for skateboarding um in video games and so I went with him I was excited to get like I got to we got to go to Nintendo and Pitch it um we went to Midway you know we went to all these different uh console and software manufacturers and were just told that this is a bad idea skateboarding is not popular home video games are barely a thing why would anyone want to buy a video game about skateboarding someone said those exact words to me um at Midway and so he got frustrated and he needed to find a job and I was I was just kind of free-floating so I said okay he goes well I'm gonna I'm not going to do this but I feel like you've established yourself at least in the Video Game World uh industry that you're interested in doing something so maybe if someone does something they'll call you and I was like yeah right sure sure enough like a year later Activision called me and they said hey we heard you want to do a video game I said well yes I would love to work on a video game I'm not a programmer or anything so we have something we're working on and we'd like to show it to you and so I went up to Activision um they were working on a skate game but it was based on an engine of a game that was already released called apocalypse starring Bruce Willis so the first version of my game was Bruce Willis on a skateboard with a gun shot to his back in a desert Wasteland doing kickflips and it was awesome it was it was truly like I picked it up and I got past that Visual and then I started playing it and and it was intuitive it the motion felt right the engine was right and I was like this is this is the Baseline of something special I didn't think it was going to be some big hit I just thought this is this is going to be appreciated by skateboarders and that was my goal the entire uh development process which was about a year and a half after I signed on we through that year and a half we were going back and forth with they would they would FedEx me builds on CDs I had a modified PlayStation and I would play it make notes and I thought man skater was going to dig this and that was it and skating wasn't even that popular it was coming to you know it was starting to get some traction what year was this again like 98 so it was like X Games were starting to come into the fold people were taking note of what skateboarding had become at that point and then I thought this is going to be cool skater's gonna like it and then um not long before the release they called me and they said hey we want to um we want to offer you a buyout of future royalties for this game um because I think you know there's I think people are going to like it I was like what does that mean they go we'll give you a half a million dollars and then you don't get royalties going forward but you get that money up front and at that time my life like to hear someone say half a million dollars seriously sounded like a half a billion dollars like no one had ever talked about numbers that big to me well also 98 was a little bit of a of a quiet time for verts skateboarding too right sure yeah but yeah for yeah luckily vert skating still was a thing because of inline skating because inline skating was huge right late 90s and they were all vert and so we as skaters got to sort of ride those coattails because it was like Hey There are boat ramps because everyone's rollerblading I forgot about that that did like and I have honestly like I was the special guest at a couple of inline rollerblade shows where it was like this is what team rollerblade live and special guest Tony Hawk the skateboarder and I was like hey all right dropping in but it paid the bills yeah um so to answer to like to to perform what you're saying bird skating was it was a thing at least established in the X Games which was something and enough for us to make a living um so when they offer me this money I actually was in a pretty good place um in terms of my I don't know my options my my trajectory and I felt like and I I had just bought a new home and I thought I'm gonna take a chance and to see what happens and like that was the best financial decision I ever met took the equity yeah I just let it ride I was like no I want to see what happens with this and as soon as the game was released it was getting Stellar reviews and then I remember like the very next week after it was released never stopped saying okay we're working on number two what do you want to do like what do you mean well yeah we're doing SQL which what awesome and then we ended up doing like 10. amazing crazy amazing I'm thinking about your decision to not take the cash and to see how it would go I'm thinking about your decision to buy a car at 16 and yet as a consequence get pulled over because you look younger um I'm thinking about the time when through the graciousness of your parents who took me in because I had no money to get back up to Northern California and they couldn't get a hold of my mom um they took me to your home but then they took me to where you were living the next day which was in Fallbrook you don't remember this but I do and I know you've heard this story before so forgive me because most people listening haven't but I remember getting driven up to Fallbrook you had the ramps in your backyard I walked in got introduced to you you were very gracious said hello what's up I said feel free to push around on the ramps outside it was the mini it was a spine ramp yeah um two ramps back to back folks it's fine uh sorry nomenclature um I think Ray Underhill was there yeah he lived there for a while yeah and as I recall you had um pretty vast music collection and we'll talk about music um but it also seemed there was a couple cars in the driveway and whatnot but it's clear to me based on a number of things and that interaction and what I observed there that either you had someone in your ear either your dad or your mom or both or maybe it had been Stacy or maybe it was somebody else who was advising you to make very good financial decisions like not spend all your money or continue to spend all your money um to invest in things you know or maybe it was just instilled in you at a young age who knows I'm asking because I think so many people burn their early success you know what represents a lot of wealth for them early on they burn that where they start making just bad decisions you explained before why you tended to avoid drugs and alcohol and certainly um any severe relationship to drugs or alcohol that would keep you from progressing and skateboarding but you know the ability to make really good decisions as a young famous athlete is more rare than it is common even when people have coaches so I'm curious you know where did that um shrewdness and that Prudence come from and was Frank your dad and maybe Nancy also you know advising you all along like hey you know um think smart be smart because clearly you've made some some very smart decisions um he was definitely a guide in it he he was the first one who said you should probably buy real estate I was 17 so I didn't even know that was possible but he co-signed made it possible um but then after that I ended up buying that home that you went to and it was four acre property and we built these ramps on it and that was amazing and definitely helped Propel my skating to a different level than I ever imagined but at some point that was just a drain and it was a drain financially and I was living beyond my means and my income kept dropping because we're talking about not long after that was 91 92 the slowest days of skating and I've got this giant mortgage and I've got this property and these ramps that I can't afford to upkeep I can barely afford my water bill at one point you know and so what you saw might have seemed stable but behind the scenes it was it was starting to unravel birdhouse hadn't been started birdhouse was started in 92 and when I started birdhouse I took the equity from that house to start it because I didn't I burned through my savings from trying to keep this place going um so I took a second mortgage out on that house right I took my Equity out started birdhouse sold the house for what I had taken out and then moved to my original place that I had when I was in high school and just pulled back on expenses I think that was that was when I really became shrewd because I had to I had I had a first child I had an income that was very uncertain very fluctuating and I was just eating Taco Bell and Top Ramen and peanut butter jelly sandwiches and and not spending anything and and taking every job like the most random demo requests or we want you to be a consultant on this commercial because I'm too old I'm 24. I'm too old to be the guy skating because it has to be youth right but they're like well we want to see what's possible so can you come up the day before and show us the ropes and so I would be the stunt skater that's filling in to show them the Angles and stuff and then they would go higher Chet Thomas as the young kid and then I would stand around I was getting paid I didn't care I think I remember those commercials It Was a Serial commercial something like that uh the serial commercial was uh Chris Miller Frosted Flakes right and I was Tony the Tiger guys you chat uh yes um I throughout the birdhouse which is your company but without telling people what is a skateboard company I remember uh Willie Santos was early on I remember his super nice kid I used to see him at the contest I remember thinking well Tony Hawk has his own company for skateboarders we had a team you know like willy willy was a maestro um Jeremy Klein legendary Street Pioneer uh Steve Berra who's kind of a we called it ATV but Street and vert um we had uh ocean Howell it was like our number one amateur we had Andrew Reynolds Matt Beach um we had a team it was full on was it fun to move from Ryder to also Ryder but team manager owner was it fun it just it was just necessary I can't say it was fun I mean yeah it was it was fun because we were still just kind of Reckless and driving you know six of us in a van driving to skate shops across the country and begging them for 300 bucks so that we could get gas and food in the hotel room and get on our way um I don't know it just it but for me it just felt like a necessity to keep to to that was what I had to do to make a brand happen and so I was willing to do it um and but it was exhausting yeah because I had to be the had to be the the coach and the tour manager and the skater you know I was putting myself out there on like the worst conditions and just rolling my ankle left and right and it was and it was all Street and it was just wasn't my thing it was it was hard but I just I loved it it made it happen in my mind I'm thinking you had to be Tony Hawk the skateboarder Frank Hawk the organizer yeah and Stacy Peralta the yeah because Stacy had been a pro skateboarder I still think of him as a skateboarder yeah even though he's filmmaker right skateboard just like I still think of Spike Jones's skateboarder bmxer filmmaker um seems like you had to integrate all of those and I mentioned that because I am curious I think a lot of people are probably curious like are you the type of person like sit back in a chair at night and think like okay like how I'm gonna do this I mean are you contemplative or is it really you just identify what needs to be done this year and over the next three years and you know set your Milestones kind of short in I guess so now we're back then back then oh no everything was just in the moment we got to get here we got to get to Dallas by tomorrow like as soon as this Demo's over getting the van we're going um we gotta get a hotel room you know it was just stuff like that it was it was very much but but I I respected I think I learned to respect um punctuality because I travel with playing at skaters that were not and didn't care and show up late and was like dude and like I don't know these guys and then when I was in charge it was like we're going to be on time because we have to respect other people's time and we said we're going to be here at three o'clock we're going to be there three o'clock um and that's not easy with a skate crew Mike blaback who as you know is it's a girl to the Hebrew and Lab podcast I talk about that we've got some other um guys that came over from DC to as filmers and editors for us and you know they're so punctual and they're so on it and I notice you showed up early today right right on timer early um early by five minutes um and that is a distinguishing factor I think in any occupation but especially in skateboarding where there's this kind of looseness sure and so if you do show up on time it really means a lot um the professionalism that you know was instilled in you it's it's clear that different places where that's showing up mentioned the shrewdness about the business decisions I'm curious about another aspect of that which is maybe a little more cryptic which is you know whether or not it was the CD collection that I saw or your mentioned of the car you're just in video games it seems that one thing that you've done that a lot of guys that I knew because back then by the way it was mostly guys now so we said they're women doing it too um women and girls it seems like you have a lot of other hobbies and interests music and Etc but that we never heard about you getting like distracted or pulled down those lines like we didn't hear about you going and surfing and getting hurt hurt surfing so that you couldn't skate we're getting really into motorcycles or race racing cars right you know um some people went hard left out of skateboarding into that like Ken Block the late great Ken Block but that became his main thing seems like you you knew that skateboarding was the main frame and stayed with that um and yet you have a lot of other interests yeah I think I I well with other sports especially like Motocross I I have this huge respect for Motocross I think it's super exciting I would love to do it and I know that I would not Escape unscathed like I would definitely want to learn the tricks do whips and flips and whatever and I'm gonna get hurt and I I don't want to risk my skate career for that so I I purposely pulled away from that type of thing um the last knee surgery I had is because I overshot a jump in Mammoth on my snowboard so that was a lesson I was like don't what are you doing just Cruise why yeah stay on the ground right hit the powder right you know free ride with your Bros because I learned my lesson and so so yeah you're right but at the same time like I still I still love going surfing and snowboarding I don't do them as much obviously um but but those are part of of what I did all growing up um and they're important to me um I did you know do a couple of celebrity car races like a NASCAR race and um I totaled a car in the Long Beach Grand Prix because this dude ramming to the wall and it was like well that was fun but I'm not I don't I don't have the bandwidth to get that serious about it and now you have a family of course too so of course yeah I mean and and those things as fun as they are and as as I don't know um as sort of auxiliary as as they are they require a lot of time I mean just for instance that Long Beach Grand Prix they want you to go stay in Palmdale for like a week and a half and train and and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe and it's like I don't know I ain't got time for that yeah that's time you're not skateboarding or with your family right yeah right now I feel the same way if I get pulled away from Reading papers and prepping podcasts and reading the latest research and thinking about experiments we could do then I for more than a couple of days I started feeling the itch I have a feeling this stuff is programmed into one's nervous system after a while like you've been skateboarding for so long that if you go a few days it probably just your system is is water or something oh yeah for sure I mean um well just for instance uh our ramp is uh being torn down on Sunday today is Friday our Ram is being turned on on Sunday at 10 A.M to be moved to Salt Lake City for our big bird event I'm going there at 8 30. so I can get a session before I can start down I love it on Father's Day that's my father's day I'm going to work at 8 30 a.m on Sunday I love it speaking of family and lineage uh tell us about your kids you've got some talented skateboarders in your family besides yourself I do um well I have four of my own and I have two step kids and um they all skate my daughter not so much anymore but all the boys five boys uh are all really into it um my oldest son is the most uh he's the most prominent because he turned Pro um and has I mean you know has his own following has a name for himself uh Riley and he's 30. yeah he kills it on Street he's a big street skateboarder he does yeah um but that you know they're they're all good they're all good skaters in their own ways and uh it's so fun I mean I I I didn't of course they're surrounded by it their whole life especially Riley because when he was young I I didn't really have the means to have child care whatever so I just said take him with me on tourism and whatnot so he was always around it so he got good at it by default but at some point started to shy away from him because he felt the pressure and My Shadow and it was like I don't this isn't fun I don't people expect me to be super good or I have to do this stuff and so he went shied away from it but then found a bunch of his friends in high school they love skating he's still good at us so he that he found his crew and they've all found their Crews uh completely independent of me and so when we go on vacation for instance we we were last year we were in uh or two years ago we were on the big on Hawaii they want to go to Ski parks I don't want to go to the skate parks I'm on vacation it's also a little harsh stuff it's a great way to get hurt right what's that over in Hawaii it's all weather worn oh yeah and it's not even my scene but but then so I go I'm I'm so I'm their chauffeur and I'm their Filmer I love it that's my vacation but but because they all love it so much you know what I mean and it just it's so cool like I mean how could I ever ask for more it's amazing let's talk about Frank and Nancy a little bit just because I have this kind of odd connection to your family through those uh it's really two or three day interaction changed my life forever meeting you was spectacular as a young skateboarding kid but also just the idea that someone would literally take me into their home I mean they had every reason to not trust me first of all I was hanging out with Billy Waldman no explanation needed the people who knew Billy I hope he's doing well I haven't heard anything about him but hope he's doing well um but we were wild but he basically took me into your home he and Nancy took me in um you know fed us um or fed me um I had another friend with me um and you know it I just have to say as you're describing your family I can only imagine what it must have been like for Frank and Nancy to see you have your kids did they get to um live long enough to see uh that Riley and your other kids were skateboarders my dad met Riley uh but my dad passed away when Riley was two so he's the only one of my kids that that he met yeah um my older sibling uh had kids so he met two of his other grandkids besides Riley um my mom got to see some of Riley's success but uh she suffered from Alzheimer's dementia and so things slipped away but um I I think that uh my dad would not believe that skateboarding is in the Olympics to him that's that is the top of the mountain because he was really into other sport he loved Sports he loved the Olympics he loves he loved watching football he loved watching baseball he loves when the Olympics were on he just he loved the competition element and the hype of it and and I think there was part of him that felt like why isn't skateboarding in this you know but he knew that there were so many hurdles to get through and so much more acceptance that needed to happen and I don't think he imagined would ever happen yeah he was a special guy I can still hear his voice he was a very large guy too I don't know if he I was just smaller then I definitely was smaller oh yeah no I mean he had like a big presence and um and I know I've told you this many times before this is actually how we got reconnected I sent you a direct message and said hey I met your parents in fact they took me into your home and I'm telling the truth and you'll know I'm telling the truth because they took me to dinner and they ordered black coffee after dinner and you know for years I would order black coffee after dinner you know as a kid you're just so impressionable these really nice people took me in I was like wow this is what a really healthy family looks like I'm grateful to have loving parents I always did but yeah I didn't have the healthy family structure so for me it was like oh my goodness these people drink black coffee after this must be what healthy families do so by the way folks don't drink caffeine within eight hours of going to sleep but um but I still do that but well you it doesn't seem to be holding you back um individualized but um yeah it's spectacular that this lineage of you know Frank to you and and I I mentioned and Nancy because it seems like while she might not have been at the contest and run around setting up tables and doing all that like she clearly was supportive as well oh oh she was I did a lot of the events too I mean they needed all hands on deck when it started getting big and no one was taking salaries you know that's the thing is that people thought like oh your dad's like cashing on he never took up money for any of that and he took so much you know what I mean he just he just loved it it was for you well it was for me and it was also for the Misfits that I surrounded myself with and even though he was he was Brash and he was like you know he was uh I don't know what's the word he was foreboding and intimidating and whatever else he did it for all those kids that were kind of lost like you I mean really like he he loved that it brought them together that he gave them a sense of self it gave them a sense of purpose he saw that because he he was that he he really had a rough childhood and he did everything he could through his adult life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kids that they surrounded themselves with so that's that's what he loved about it of course he loved seeing me Thrive too but he loved that he created the safe space and this this sense of community and so my mom my mom was that was her thing was getting people together gatherings you know oh we should all get together like even even my siblings and I as much as we want to emulate our parents we don't do it as much that as they did and we regret that well there's still time no we I mean we do but yeah um It's Tricky we're all different areas sure yeah the the person that comes to mind when I think about your dad I'm forgetting the movie but there's this one Clint Eastwood movie where he lives in a neighborhood where I think it's a bunch of young Hmong oh is that gangsters El Camino El Camino yeah and I just remember like there's that scene of like Clint coming out on his porch and just standing really upright yeah everything in his front his front lawn is everything's super manicured and just standing there like this immense presence and that's how I remember Frank Hawk yeah but he was a total softy that's the thing that's that's the you know there there was a it was it was all a front well he was certainly very precious like you you know you you got you got to see that side of him where it's just like oh yeah come on we'll we'll take you out you want to go see Tony's Place let's go like that's not some hard ass well there's a tail end of the story too where he actually called my mom and I think there may have been a statement or two about hey this kid's 14 like he can't be in Linda Vista Boys Club taking the bus back to Lancaster et cetera et cetera may have been some discussion like that but then they also paid for me to go home oh yeah they flew me home yeah so I think I owe you a couple hundred bucks for a Southwest flight or whatever Airline it was well it's it's fun and I think important to reminisce about these people because um they aren't just your parents but they've done so much and through you you know I I really think that um emotions and stories are really like the equivalent of energy in humans you know when people talk about energy because that gets carried forward um speaking of which we share a common love of some particular music are you somebody who listens to music to sort of um to inspire you to get amped up to go skateboard it's music an important part of your life yeah let's put it this way I had I had a playlist for my 540 the other day okay fine tune to that trick and what would get me motivated in the Hypes to to do it uh you don't have to share with us what's on the playlist unless you choose to oh man but was it high energy low energy high energy well and and some meaningful songs like um New Order ceremony and uh see nice nails getting smaller because that was a song we used in one of our big skate tours and it was one of the most high energy sections of the show um uh gosh they were so I I can't go through all of them I forget um uh gang of four um uh wait what's going for it is uh I forgot what is it um oh I find that Essence rare fires up so I had I had like 10 that were just gonna if any of those played it's I'm gonna make it and and I knew that it was about an hour and a half and that's as long as I'm gonna try it before I'm too tired so you're listening in the warehouse or you're listening in the warehouse on random and then uh the song that I made it to was uh off of that Prodigy album fat of the Lamb uh and it's called clamatize it's instrumental I use it for a birdhouse edit when 4-1-1 was the thing well remember these little like video newsletter type things yeah anyway so when that song came on I I was feeling it I made it fantastic I love this because you know the neuroscientist In Me Is immediately gonna say you know we have this brain that loves to take an information and discard other information but paired Association is so strong yeah and when you couple that with some sense of reward like the making of the variable below coping as a as as early in life or making the 540fs as a comeback to you know the injury after the injury it was almost like I loved all that music but I was indoctrinated by it through the skate parks because that was the soundtrack to This it was it was punk music it was Sex Pistols and and 999 and black flag and Devo and X Buzzcocks and you know that that was that's what I kept hearing and that's what I associate with my best of times it's in your nervous system yeah yeah there's a few voices you know rancid and Tim Armstrong and and the Operation Ivy Operation Ivy sound system sound system was on that playlist was on the 540 playlist all right you know Tim will be so happy to hear that and Matt Freeman the bass player and Jesse Michaels is now playing again with Tim the lead singer of Operation Ivy yeah with their new um their new gig what's it called they had a name and then they they uh they changed it oh okay initially it was uh well I don't want to say because they changed it for a reason but we know I know they're making new music yeah which is amazing operation Hive is incredible my yearbook photo for I think two years running was the cover of Operation Ivy because I didn't show up for the yearbook photo speaking of which did you show up for yearbook photos or did you graduate high school I graduated high school but I didn't go to any of the events prom or any of the auxiliary I didn't know I mean I was I was an outcast like I was not even though I had success in skating skating wasn't cool and I was not homies with anyone at school except for two other skaters and we felt very ostracized so nah yeah I did show up for the graduation because because my mom and dad wanted to see it yeah likewise I graduated but I could tell you more about the curbs in the parking lot of my high school than I could about anything that happened in the class man I broke so many sprinkler heads because the sprinkler heads were right next to the curb and there was a double-sided curb and so if you board slide because I'd go there early and board slide and then I'd just like lean too far in and break the sprinkler head and never got caught what high school uh well I went to a couple I went to Sarah High School originally um then I went to San Diego High School which is in North County and then I ended up at Torrey Pines I got so bullied at San Diego that I requested to be transferred because I I couldn't go I couldn't survive there as a skater I would have to hide my skateboard in the bushes before class and then go find it after school so that people wouldn't Target me the 80s were rough it was like it was like a John Hughes film well for sure it was jocks versus nerds and then skaters were like not even considered in that realm because they're just gonna get they're going to get hammered because there were so few of us well things have changed and not only have things have changed such that skateboarding is far more popular and respected and you know at least one mark of that is in the Olympics although there are other marks of respect certainly but a huge Evolution that I've observed is when I was skateboarding as a 14 year old and you know into my uh close to my 20s and then took some time off for sure um hardly any girls hardly any women there were a few like carabeth Burnside they got teased ridiculed it was hard on them super hard yeah super hard now largely through Instagram um but some other channels as well you can see this young girl Rhys onvert skateboarding better than a lot of grown men who have been skateboarding for decades I mean um and then there are a number of other ones in the um in Street skateboarding um and also taking really hard slams like you know so this this is a complete revision of the recent history of skateboarding thoughts on that and um on Reese and there are a few others was it is it um Lizzy who uh took a really bad fall that was filmed right there broke the um Knack offer femur yeah yeah these are tough ladies yeah yeah I'm doing it and for coming back Lizzy Lizzy did the loop she did the full 360 Loop first woman to ever do it so what do you think changed like that that paved the way is it just you know a critical mass of uh females doing it is it that um you know Sky Brown you know for sure for sure there were there were the Pioneers people like care about the Burnside um and uh uh there's so many others um Patty Hoffman was one of the one of the first verse skaters to who were they planted the seed and and then there were other women that took inspiration like oh girls can do this even though they're largely outnumbered and they get hassled for sure and then through the street era um people like Alyssa Steamer who who paid the way for legit Street skating um but then through the years it started to become more common more accepted which is dumb to say because it's just always been it should have always been accepted but the thing that that really tipped the scale was when everything was leading up to the Olympics there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines for men and women and suddenly there was no question of should we have a should we have a women's event like no we have to have a management because that's how we that's the road to qualifying for this the Olympic stage and Vance Park series to their credit they were holding events simultaneously not that we're Olympic qualifiers but just their own and they said these events are equal across the board equal prize money equal attention I mean it was just like that that was just a matter of fact and that shifted a lot it really did now if you go to a skatepark you see plenty of them there yeah it's awesome like literal women like moms you know there's there are older women that are learning how to skate it's awesome not that it matters so much but does anyone claim to be the first female do 540 on vert is that sort of a known that would be Lindsay Adams fantastic um and she did that I'll tell you how she did that she was trying it um so she's trying she's trying to make twists uh she's married to Travis Pastrana it's like the you know it's like the the Elite action sports couple um and she was trying them she was she was getting pretty close and then we did a big exhibition in Paris at the uh Grand Palais on behalf of quicksilver it was a huge event um they put a half pipe up and we did this giant show there were thousands of people there and it was very much um unspoken but expected that I was going to do 900 at this event um I think it was I want to say it was 2010 Maybe and uh or no like 2009 and and the organizers were kind of like okay so we're gonna do this and then you know at some point you do a 900 and I was like I I can't guarantee that ever like every time I've ever made it it's been pretty spontaneous I've you know I've set out to do it and not I've come up short I can't guarantee it I'll try I'll try and they they're like yeah yeah okay and so I knew the whole time when they were skating I was like okay everyone's expecting this so I kind of went through the motions of of uh doing my exhibition tricks you know playing the hits and then started trying 900s and at the same time Lindsay started trying 540s because she was feeling that energy and so it was this sort of not battle but definitely we were we were trading hits it was like all right here goes Tony no he missed it and here goes Lindsay oh she missed it and then I uh she almost made one like was riding down you know and and then fell at the flat bottom it was like oh and then I made 900 and it was kind of the show stopper because like that's what they expected and everyone's going crazy and whatever people are coming down off the ramp knee sliding down and we're saying goodbye to the crowd and I look up and Lindsay puts her tail out there's still people standing on the ramp and she puts her tail out and I was like I think Lindsay wants to try it again here we go I'm on the mic now she made it love it she stole the show like without question it was huge you can look it up on on YouTube like it's there Lindsay Adams first first 540. it was awesome and then she made it and we all grabbed her and put her on her shoulders that is awesome it was pretty cool that was awesome because these things are like the four minute mile as a barrier then people break that barrier and then other people break that barrier it's I mean I I watched enough of skateboarding recent years see you know like the sky Brown thing she's phenomenal and I actually saw her family out to dinner here in Los Angeles and um with her brother and her folks are really gracious really nice and there again you know parents going to the skate park after all she's couldn't drive herself I think she's at that time she was probably like nine you know probably one of the biggest shifts too is that parents encourage their kids to skate now could you imagine that when we were young never no there were so many factors telling us not to it's just made us want to do it more sure but yeah now now kids are like parents are pushing them into it get out there learn tricks it's like wait that's not what we're supposed to be doing but it's cool that that I think it I think with the the really cool factor of all that is there are definitely people our age I'm grouping you into my age category 47. all right yeah plus enough um but but that have kids and and skateboarding was such a special time in our life and then they're rediscovering it through their kids and they're skating together and I think that's just so amazing that someone of our age would be like you know what I used to do that you're into that like let's go and then you could show your kid how to do a sweeper I could probably do that I don't have kids yet but when I do I'll show I intend on being healthy enough and yeah to do a sweeper people can look up sweeper we don't have to explain it for him but a little laid back grind or a sweeper yep oh yeah because they won't they wouldn't think to do it no and they are doing all these difficult flip tricks and that's not my it's not my scene oh yeah what's your go-to on a game escape if you're gonna really like take out the younger generation um I can do Impossibles pretty uh pretty regularly on transition consistently I knew I'm flat so this is where basically you scrape the back of the it's an ollie really but it wraps around the back of it over your foot yeah um that's kind of my my sneak attack on game's Escape does Rodney Mullen get credit for that trick still oh yes that's yeah it's a Rodney are you still in touch with Rodney absolutely yeah yeah he's somebody that um certainly deserves deserves mention in the pioneering of tricks I think if he's the Godfather of modern skateboarding I think of Rodney you and Mark Gonzalez gons as like the the guys that I'm honored drove the um the progression in different partially overlapping directions that set the template for us I learned fingertips because of Rodney like the first trick you saw me do I learned that because I saw Rodney do it on the ground and I thought well I can't do it on the ground but I have plenty of time in the air to do it it's awesome it's awesome that Stacy put you guys together we we mentioned Bones Brigade but we didn't really talk about the architecture of it from the perspective of skateboard progression but it was um kind of like any good band it seemed like there was really good chemistry yeah um interpersonally but also um that there was each person had something unique you skated the way you did Mike skate the way he did Stevie the way he did and you know Rodney and you know and we respected each other but we also fed off each other Tommy Guerrero yep right because growing up in the Bay Area like yeah in fact Tommy's getting the hills of San Francisco in those videos makes it look easy yeah but those Hills are are rough they're dangerous and they have real life obstacles like moving buses you'll notice he wasn't stopping his top signs so that's fantastic uh we could reminisce about all these angles but the the point being that um spending time with people who do similar things or the same thing but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress that's why I routinely fly to Texas and hang out with Peter attia another podcaster Lex Friedman just because they do things differently than I do um where do you draw sort of peripheral inspiration from now like I know you I see Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite a lot the Phenom Jimmy Wilkins it's kind of eerie how good that kid is um who else are you spending time with besides Rhys and one of the reasons I asked this is that skateboarding is unique among many sports in that a given session a gathering uh to skateboard will include an enormous five-year-old man and 10 year old girls exactly yes which is which is incredible you don't think about soccer you know a serious game of soccer between professional soccer but also it's not even that we're skating together is that we are communicating and influencing each other I mean that is like the last conversation I have with Rhys was she's talking about like are you gonna try to do 540 stand I go yeah I'm kind of working on it she goes well I think because she saw me try one she goes I think you need to pull out a little more and she was right and she's how old again she's 10. and I and I didn't even consider that because I'm just back in my mode and I'm not taking into consideration that I don't have the snap that I had before I got hurt and she was I mean that was one key to me making it and you know did that that's but it but to me that's just that's representative skateboarding and the inclusivity of it and the diversity of it where it's me I'm 55 there's 30 year old uh Pros that are at the top of the game there are 17 year old up and comers men women 10 year old girl that is doing tricks that we've never even thought of or want to do and it's all part of the the whole mix that's really beautiful I want to ask you about memorabilia not a topic that I think about much but I think in a prior conversation of ours you mentioned something about this so you know there are skateboard collectors there are people that collect stickers skateboards there's a whole market and world for this and um in addition to people wanting selfies with you when they see you I imagine um there's a long history and continued tradition of people taking a pen putting your hand and saying can you sign this right because um you are in this uh very uh small but very um clearly esteemed group of people where your signature increases the value of things so how does that work uh and how does that feel like if a skateboarder who you know there are the telltale signs of who is and who isn't right um um if they walk up to you and they're like hey will you sign this do you feel good about signing it or is that something that you refrain from and if somebody's just merely a collector a Trader and they're trying to um build their portfolio so to speak um you can probably also sense that so I'm not trying to put you uh in the hot seat here um well to answer your question through the years I was always open to that and and I'm happy to um especially when people are skaters or Escape fans and whatnot in the last three years there has been this new element of resellers of people that just go buy signature stuff they have nothing to do with skating they don't care about skateboarding at all they just want to get my signature on an item and sell it and they usually do it on eBay or through their own channels um that's fine at some point like a few years ago I respected the hustle these guys are they knew that I was going to be at this event okay they're outside waiting they've been waiting for hours I'll sign a couple things but in recent months even they have figured out how to get my flight info like some hacked into my my actual Airline accounts some have sources at certain airports that get the Manifest and they sell the information I found all this out because I've actually held a couple of them accountable because I said look I'm not going to sign this until you tell me how you knew I was going to be here I have no business here I'm here to visit family no one knows I'm coming here oh well we saw a friend said they saw you at the uh Detroit airport like no they didn't they wouldn't know where I'm going to anyway like why I saw it on Twitter you didn't see it on Twitter I'm on Twitter tell me the truth there's a guy from TMZ that gets flight info and he sells it to us okay thank you but that has increased to a point where it's not it's not sustainable I can't I can't please everyone the last time I flew out of Chicago there were about 15 people one guy had a shopping cart full of skateboards and they all they all bum rushed me at security before I went through security thinking that I'm going to sign stuff I'm like you guys I can't I can't do that I might miss my flight and I can't delineate who like I I I'm sorry you guys have like sabotaged yourselves I don't know what to say and then I went through security and there were four D's waiting at the gate they had bought tickets airline tickets so that it could be past security that they airline tickets they're not going to use to chase this wow so I mean when people want My Autograph but it's weird and it's intrusive and it's kind of creepy yeah just tell them that a neuroscientist told you that you got to get that slob air right and if you sign too many autographs that uh you're not going to get the tuck knee you're not just not going to be do the flat knee invert you're just not going to get anyway it is it's just a really weird new thing that is weird it has popped up and um other than that and and so the tricky part is when there is a public thing or a public exhibition or whatever to try to figure out who is the true skate fans and who aren't um usually they're pretty identifiable but it it just it has ruined the experience for people who truly are the grew up skating uh well thanks for sharing that and um we won't tell everyone what the telltale signs are so that these people don't exploit them the skateboarders the real fans will know um uh they won't have to worry about whether or not they represent accurately because you just will um on the positive side something I've been wanting to learn more about from you is your philanthropic efforts um I think Kevin Rose um who's in the tech sector was the first to mention to me that you have you guys have done some philanthropy together um and maybe you've done some with Jim thibo as well the great Jim thibo yeah uh well both both Jim and Kevin were board members uh Jim is the current board member of the skateboard project but tell us about the skateboard project um it's it's it's my non-profit and we try to develop public skate parks in our certain underserved areas but more so by by supporting the community and giving them the resources to do so so groups that are trying to get skate parks in the area we are the resource center for them um we'll give them advice we'll give them funding we'll give them uh our stamp of approval and that can go a long way and uh to date we've helped to fund over almost a thousand skate parks now and seven or eight hundred of which are open um I mean it's my proudest word for sure and and it's because I never I I never took for granted the fact that I grew up near a skatepark and that was my home away from home that was where I found my sense of community my sense of identity my my crew and so many kids choose the skateboard but have no support in doing so and so those skate parks are a lifeline yeah I can attest they they absolutely save lives there's no question where can people find out more about your foundation we can provide a link but where dot org so where does the funding for these Parks actually come from um it comes from donations from supporters it comes from fundraisers some corporate uh sometimes funding is is funneled through us for specific regions um like the uh uh we have a built to play project that's in Michigan and New York and that's funded by the Ralph C Wilson Junior Foundation um so they they give us the funding and then we have to give it to that area but but it's easy because there's plenty of projects and now there's an abundance of skate parks in those areas I love it thank you for doing that for organizing around that and I get to get more places to skate [Laughter] I'm curious what's in the immediate Horizon right um these days you probably have the option to say yes to things and no to things um you know you have a family you have your skateboard career um where do you place your priorities in terms of how to carve up your day or your week I mean what would you like to make sure that you do or as much of the hours of your waking day for the next let's just say five years because and if you want to extend that out you can but um well I I want to be available to my kids first and foremost um and we still have one at home for the next four years so uh I will make sure that I'm available to her and in terms of career I never had great aspirations like I never thought okay these are this is what I want to accomplish it was always just very more you know trick specific oriented so it's always like I want to try this and this and this I would like to continue skating I don't know if I'll be able to skate at the level I'm skating right now in five years but I know that I'll still be on the ramp I may not be doing it in public um trying to advocate for public skate parks doing more with the foundation um and whatever I think I think the way I prioritize My Time is what will resonate the furthest and have the best impact on skateboarding in general I do feel that I've come to a point where yes I'm some um unofficial ambassador to skateboarding and I want to represent it well I want I want to be fair in that skateboarding has all kinds of different things it's not just X Games or Olympics or or whatnot it represents [Music] um a true culture and I want to project that as much as I can and make sure that people understand that that's also positive um and I mean it really everything that I'm doing now is just kind of fun okay it's for the I would say in the last five to ten years is the first time I've truly enjoyed what skateboarding has provided me in terms of opportunity and what it brings to me and and what it means to my family like I have a much better appreciation understanding for it and these days it's just like everything's kind of just gravy it's just so fun I can't believe I can still do it for a living it's crazy I'm 55 years old and I truly ride my skateboard as a career like that's nuts and I won't have it in any other way well it certainly is earned and um I just want to say thank you for a number of things first of all um thank you for going to the skate park thank you for picking this trajectory thank you for inspiring me and so many other young people and old people older people over so many decades now both with what you did on a skateboard and off the skateboard and including your resilience and determination to push and continue to progress to the point where you were badly injured and then to push through that come back at least match what you did previously and I I would wager that you will exceed your prior skill level going forward so I want to thank you for your resilience I know it comes from an intrinsic Drive um Your Love of skateboarding it just absolutely comes through I share in some of that um of course having grown up in it but not nearly as much as you but also just your willingness to stretch out into these different areas like the video game thing or talk about X Games um uh the Olympics because that did allow for a lot of growth and lateral movement of skateboarding and at the same time just as you said to bring it right back to the fact that skateboarding isn't one thing it is not like other sports it's its own Sport and it's its own lifestyle it's its own thing um and we do consider you the Ambassador for skateboarding and appreciate it um I speak for many people and I say that uh we're very grateful that you are because you bring that that shrewdness and that Prudence to it but also that get after it punk rock Spirit and the goodness that your parents you know instilled in you clearly comes through everything from the philanthropy and onward so I can't say enough positive things and or express enough gratitude for your what you've gone in for your time here your legacy in skateboarding but also just in the Game of Life is clearly cemented so thank you oh thank you well hey I and I appreciate that the ethos of skateboarding shines through on your show and just your crew here it's clearly a lot of them come from the skateboard world so you're you're still supporting it whether you know it or not thanks so much and uh hopefully you'll come back and we'll do it again all right sounds good thank you for joining me for today's

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feeds YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere. We also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere. Research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny Foundation has agreed to match that amount. So now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe, or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one-time payment. And again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium. For those of you that are already subscribers to the premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium subscription feed. And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you. So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about kratom. And the question is, what are the short and long-term effects of taking kratom? For those of you that haven't heard of kratom, kratom is a substance that comes from a tree that grows naturally in Indonesia. The tree itself is called mitragyna speciosa. And it's been known for hundreds of years or more. We don't really know how long, but at least for a couple of hundred years, that when people chew the leaves of this tree, they experience a mild stimulant effect. And there's also a process of extraction whereby you can take the leaves and get high concentrations of kratom that nowadays is packaged into various supplements. Most often consumed in capsule form, although sometimes it's sold in raw powder form. Here's the key thing to understand about kratom. Indeed at low dosages, kratom has a mild stimulant effect. However, at higher dosages, it has what's called an analgesic effect, that is a painkilling effect, and it acts as a sedative. And kratom itself acts as an opioid in the body. This is what's making kratom a very controversial topic these days. In particular, because most people have heard of the so-called opioid crisis. The opioid crisis has been a term coined to largely center around issues that have taken place in the United States, although these issues definitely extend beyond the borders of the United States. But the opioid crisis is essentially the overconsumption and widespread addiction to opioids. Opioids include things like morphine, oxycodone, also called OxyContin, and there are other opioids similar to those compounds, all of which have the general effect of being painkillers and sedatives. And in some people, again some people, eliciting a sense of euphoria in particular at low to moderate dosages. However, people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs and need to consume more and more of them in order to get the effect that they initially got from a lower dosage. And they are not just highly habit-forming. They are highly addictive. And we can distinguish between habit forming and addictive by simply saying that addictive means people will continue to take something or do something despite negative consequences. There are other relevant definitions of addiction as well. I define addiction more broadly as the progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure. And indeed, when people get addicted to opioids, it is a very bad picture. It often hampers many, many areas of their lives, and seriously so. So the opioid crisis refers to the overprescription of opioid drugs. That's sort of what it generally taken to mean. But it also includes accessing opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, et cetera through gray market sources through, black market sources, and on and on. And of course, the acquisition of the drugs is just one piece it's also the over consumption of those drugs and, of course, the addiction to those drugs, which has proved to be so pernicious. So what does this have to do with kratom? Kratom is also an opioid. And we'll talk about how it differs in its opioid properties from the drugs I just talked about because it is different from morphine and hydrocodone, but it also has some similar properties as well. But the deal with kratom is that a good number of people out there have managed to wean themselves off opioids such as morphine and hydrocodone through the use of kratom. And that has been used as justification for keeping kratom on the market and keeping it legal. However, and this is a very important however, kratom itself has also proved to be not only habit forming but addictive, especially when taken at dosages that exceed that lower dose that just generally creates a bit of stimulant, a little bit of euphoric effect. When people start taking higher dosages of kratom, it is very clear that it does become addictive, and itself is very hard to come off of, so much so that people experience so-called kratom withdrawal. Now the reason I mentioned that kratom has been used by a good number of people to wean themselves off of the more potent forms of prescription opioids is that when I solicited for questions about kratom on social media, it was a very binary response. In fact, there was one camp a very rabid camp that said kratom is terrible. I took this stuff. I got addicted. It was extremely hard to come off of. There were additional comments in there, such as I know somebody who literally had to go to rehab because of kratom who developed a bunch of other addictions because of kratom. Essentially many, many responses of people who had only bad experiences with kratom. Meaning they liked it enough at first that they continued to take it, and it became addictive for them or somebody that they know. However, there was another camp that was equally vocal, which kept saying no if one really adheres to the lower dosages of kratom, kratom itself can be a useful tool for getting off other opioids. And there were even a few bona fide medical professionals, medical doctors that is, and I happen to know them and their reputations as quite good, who chimed in and sort of reconciled the two camps by saying indeed, if one can avoid taking kratom at all, you should. There is no reason to take this thing thinking that it's quote-unquote good for you. You would be wise to avoid taking it because there is a high probability if you take it at a given dosage or at a dosage that is going to get your brain and body into a state of euphoria, analgesia, and the sort of classic opioid effect that it's going to become habit forming or addicting for you. That said, these same medical professionals acknowledged that a fair number of people that they knew managed to get off of the more potent forms of opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and so forth using kratom. And they said, well if it's a choice between being addicted to morphine and hydrocodone versus taking kratom and addicted to those substances and kratom somehow allowed them to taper off of those substances, that they would look more favorably upon kratom if and only if they would also commit to progressively lowering their dose of kratom and eventually coming off of kratom. So the general takeaway from all of that is if you can avoid taking kratom, meaning if you haven't taken it already, don't. And that reminds me of a very important point, which a guest on the Huberman lab podcast Dr. Robert Malenka who's an M.D. and Ph.D. He's my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine. He's a world expert on the mechanisms underlying addiction and dopamine and drug reinforcement, among many other things. What he said on the podcast is absolutely true, which is that it is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. That might seem obvious but think about that one again. It is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. So I think the safest statement to make is if you have not tried kratom, you would be wise to avoid it because you stand a chance to become addicted to it. If, however, you are somebody that's addicted to other forms of opioids, you absolutely should talk to your physician about that and how to get off of those opioids. But there is evidence that some people have used kratom to successfully wean themselves off the more potent forms of opioids that I talked about, namely morphine and hydrocodone, as well as a few others. Now if you're somebody who already takes kratom, you need to be very thoughtful about the dosage that you take. And you also need to be thoughtful about the fact that people differ dramatically in their response to opioids. This is oh so important, and people do not talk about this enough. We hear, for instance, that, oh, if people are taking anywhere from one to five grams, maybe one to six grams of kratom per day, that's keeping it in the dosage range for which people don't generally tend to get addicted, you'll hear things like that. And by the way, when I say one to five or one to six grams per day, I'm not talking about the individual compounds that are present in kratom. There are a couple of different plant alkaloids I'll talk about in a moment that are present in kratom. And these have different effects on the opioid system. So nowadays, some of the companies that sell kratom. And by the way, this is sold over the counter as a supplement. It does not require a prescription to purchase, at least at this point in time, in the United States. Some of these products will have a higher concentration of one or the other alkaloids within them such that you can't really compare one gram of one brand of kratom to one gram of another brand of kratom because they can have wildly different levels of these different alkaloids. And these different alkaloids have wildly different impact on different aspects of your brain and body biology. In particular, how much they tend to impact the so-called endogenous opioid system, OK. So when we talk about dosages, we have to keep this in the back of our mind. And we have to keep in the back of our mind that there does seem to be a subgroup of people. We don't know how big this subgroup of people is, but we know it's not everyone, but it's somewhere between 10 and 40% of people seem to respond to opioids in a particularly potent way. They really like them. And perhaps not surprisingly, people outside of that category don't tend to like opioids. I can certainly say that I am somebody who, when I've been prescribed things like Vicodin or any other opioid post-surgery for pain, I hate taking those drugs. I absolutely hate it. I'd rather deal with the pain. They make me nauseous. They make me feel terrible. That said, I know people who love opioids. It's like a natural fit for their chemistry in the sense that it tends to evoke more euphoria. They just immediately like the feeling. Some of you may remember the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast that I did about alcohol. And there, too, I discussed the fact that about 8% to 10% of people who consume alcohol get an increased dopamine response to alcohol that's not observed in other people. And that particular subgroup of people is very, very at risk for developing alcohol use disorder, sometimes called alcoholism, because they can drink in a way and they experience a high from drinking in a way that other people simply do not experience. Now like everybody else, if they consume too much alcohol, they get drunk. So it's not about the drunk effect, it's about the dopamine and other sorts of chemicals that are released in those people in response to alcohol that other people just don't seem to experience at the same level of potency. So again, with things like kratom and the other opioids, there's a category of people, and it's a much larger category of people, again 10% to 40%. We don't know exactly how many because the studies are not really completed, and there aren't enough of those studies yet, unfortunately. But when those people take an opioid, wow, oh, wow, do they like it. And those people, in particular, are very much at risk for developing an addiction to opioids. And so those people, especially, should never ever go near kratom if they haven't. Or if they are already taking kratom, these are the people that are constantly ratcheting up their dose. These are the people that tell you no, I'm not addicted, but if you were to say, hey, all right, well then let's do an experiment where you don't take kratom for a week, those are going to be the people that are suddenly going to get anxious about the mere idea of that. I've also talked about this in reference to cannabis when I did an episode about cannabis. Again I'm not putting a blanket statement out there about cannabis as being good or bad. On that episode, I talked about the fact that cannabis does indeed have various therapeutic uses. But that there are a good number of people who rely on cannabis for anxiety control and other ways of modulating their brain chemistry and bodily chemistry such that if you were to say, hey, are you addicted to cannabis? They'd say no, I don't have to smoke cannabis. I don't have to take my edibles. But if you were to push them a little bit and say, all right, well then, let's do an experiment where you don't consume any cannabis in any form for 10 days. They don't like the idea of that experiment at all. So much so that were they to run that experiment, they would experience a lot of the withdrawal symptoms associated with addiction. So I can't, in good faith, say that kratom is safe for everybody because it is simply not. Now is it safer than the other opioids? And if so, why? Well, in order to address that, let's take a short glance at the pharmacology of kratom and how it works in terms of its neurochemistry in the body. Now I'm going to keep this pretty brief because, in the future, I'm going to do an extended episode all about opioids, and I will include kratom in that conversation. But just to back up a little bit and discuss what opioids are. Opioids are compounds that can activate the so-called endogenous opioid system. All of us have within our brain and body the capacity to release our own opioids. That's right. You have opioids within your body. They are released from neurons, and they bind to so-called opioid receptors. Perhaps some of you have heard of the so-called runner's high. The runner's high is a euphoric state. It's a fairly mild euphoric state in most cases. But it's a euphoric state induced by long-duration effort, a.k.a. the runner's high. The runner's high is just a phrase used to explain that when we engage in long-duration repetitive action effort, the body starts releasing these endogenous opioids they bind to receptors, and they trigger things like analgesia, relief from pain. They trigger mild euphoria. They tend to change our perception of the outside world, make things look more beautiful, shiny. They give things a little bit of a sheen. What I just described is a mild version of what people experience when they take something like morphine. When people take morphine, there's a more of a sedative effect, there's more of a euphoric effect, and there's more of a dreamlike effect. And again, it will depend on dosage. Kratom and morphine, and hydrocodone all have the property of acting like the endogenous opioids but at much higher potency. When you bring them into your system, they cross the blood-brain barrier. So they go into the brain, and they bind to a number of different opioid receptors. There's the mu-opioid receptor. By the way, these names all follow Greek alphabet letters. So the mu-opioid receptor, the kappa opioid receptor, there are a bunch of different ones. Kratom binds preferentially to the mu-opioid receptor and somewhat to the kappa opioid receptor. There's a big misconception out there. A lot of people, especially people who are proponents of kratom, will say no morphine and hydrocodone bind the mu-opioid receptor, whereas kratom binds the kappa opioid receptor. So it's a different compound. Very, very different. Not true. Not true. Kratom, morphine, and hydrocodone all bind to the mu-opioid receptor. And that's what's largely responsible for its opioid-like effects. Especially when you get the dosage up to a level where you start getting the mild sedation, the analgesia, the pain relief. And keep in mind a lot of people are taking kratom because they want pain relief. And when that mu-opioid receptor system is activated, it indirectly activates a lot of the reinforcement circuitry in the brain that relates to dopamine and serotonin. This is another area that we'll go into in more depth in the future. But there's been a lot of controversy. People saying, oh, you know kratom doesn't trigger the dopamine system, therefore, it's not addictive. But that is simply not true. It indirectly activates the reinforcement circuitry that includes both dopamine and serotonin. But its primary effect is to hit this mu-opioid receptor system that exists in a bunch of places in the brain but mainly in the brainstem in a structure called the periaqueductal gray nucleus, which then provides pain relief. It triggers a number of different shifts in cognition. It's what creates that mild euphoria, et cetera, et cetera. Now how can we be so confident that kratom is acting so similarly to hydrocodone and to morphine, albeit with lower potency? And the reason is if you give people a drug that blocks the mu-opioid receptor prior to them taking kratom, they don't experience any of the classic effects of taking kratom. No euphoria, no analgesia, no sedation. Even at the low dosages no mild stimulant effect. So we really have to look at kratom as an opioid, OK. That's just the honest truth. And if you're somebody who doesn't like this message because you like kratom, I'm not telling you that you don't like kratom, I'm telling you likely like kratom because it's an opioid. So again, if you go online and you start asking questions about kratom, again, you're going to see these two camps. You're going to see the kratom is terrible, it's addictive, it's everything bad camp. And then you're going to see the other camp out there very vocal as well, talking about how kratom helped them avoid other things that are worse. And this is an argument that, frankly, I don't think we want to lean on, right. The idea that substance A is not as bad as substance B. And that making substance A unavailable is just going to send everyone running for substance B. That's a weak argument, frankly. I heard this argument around cannabis. And by the way, I think pretty balanced about cannabis. If you listen to the episode I did on cannabis, I think you'll agree that I believe that cannabis has its therapeutic applications. I also believe that young people, especially young males with a predisposition to psychosis, should not be taking high-concentration THC cannabis. Because the data tell us they are already at risk of psychosis, and they are at a much greater risk of psychosis if they do. So I think I'm pretty balanced about the story on cannabis. But I often hear the argument oh cannabis isn't as bad as alcohol and, therefore, cannabis is good. That's simply not rational. What we should be saying is whether or not it's cannabis or alcohol or kratom or any substance for that matter, what are the potential benefits, what are the potential risks? And again, this is far too much than we can go into in this AMA. And we will go into in a future full-length episode of the Huberman Lab podcast. But the other thing to really keep in mind is the lack of regulation over kratom supplements. Now as many of you know, I am a fan of many, not all, but many supplements in certain conditions. I always say behavior is first, then nutrition. Then if and only if it's needed, rely on supplementation. But supplementation is a big category. But when we're talking about supplements that are opioid compounds, I start to get nervous because of the high abuse potential and the high addiction potential of opioids. And kratom is included in that category. A couple of other key notes about kratom. While death directly from kratom is fairly rare, it has happened. Now hydrocodone and morphine suppress respiration. Actually, suppress breathing by way of a mechanism that, if you're a listener of the Huberman Lab podcast, you know about. Which is the so-called physiological sigh. Many of you have heard me talk about the physiological sigh. Is something that you do voluntarily the double Inhale through the nose and then a long exhale in order to rapidly reduce your level of stress. As far as we know, that's the fastest way to deliberately lower your level of stress. But the physiological sigh was discovered in the 1930s as a spontaneous pattern of breathing that occurs involuntarily in sleep in order to reinflate the lungs and offload carbon dioxide and bring oxygen back into the system on the subsequent breath. When I interviewed Dr. Jack Feldman, who is a professor at University of California Los Angeles and really the pioneer of the modern neuroscience understanding of respiration, he talked about some studies in his laboratory that were exploring why people die when taking opioids. This is a major issue associated with the opioid crisis. And what he mentioned was that the opioids bind to particular receptors in the brain stem locations that generate physiological sighs. So opioids, when taken as drugs, suppress physiological sighing and do so during sleep. And lack of adequate respiration, meaning people stop breathing during sleep, is one of the primary reasons why people die when they take opioids. Now kratom is not known to suppress respiration when taken at low to moderate dosages. But when combined with any other opioids, and certainly when combined with alcohol, it can suppress respiration. And while the data on this are fairly scant, there is some evidence that kratom-induced death is caused by suppression of the respiration system. So again, death due to taking kratom at the dosages that are recommended on most commercial packaging is fairly rare, although it has happened. It's unclear if it happened because it was taken in combination with other compounds. That seems likely. But we can't forget that a lot of people are taking kratom at much higher dosages and, in fact, progressively higher and higher dosages from these over-the-counter sources. And with increased dosage, there is, yes, an increased risk of respiratory failure. So again, all of this points to the fact that kratom is simply not a benign substance. So if we're going to be very honest, the addictive potential of kratom is real. It is exacerbated for some people compared to others, but it is real. It's very similarities to other more potent forms of opioids are what make it attractive for some people who are trying to come off those more potent form of opioids. But the goal, of course, is to completely come off all opioids. And kratom itself can be a bit of a trap. It can be a trap in the sense that people who have never taken other opioids can become addicted to kratom itself. That is absolutely clear that can happen. It has happened in a great number of people. It's also clear that kratom can potentially be a trap. Notice I said potentially. Because if people are trying to come off other more potent forms of opioids and then they use kratom to do that, and then they're ratcheting up their dosage of kratom such that they're now matching the endogenous response to kratom in a way that doesn't really distinguish from the effects that they were getting from morphine and hydrocodone, well then they're just using a different form of morphine and hydrocodone. And I'm sure that some of you are out there saying that is ridiculous. You cannot compare the effects of kratom to the effects of hydrocodone. But the potency is about one-sixth of hydrocodone. And there are people out there who are just increasing and increasing both the dosage and modifying the type of kratom that they're taking so that they're getting the kratom that has a particularly high concentration of one of the alkaloids that hits that mu-opioid receptor hardest. And in doing so, sure, they're not getting the pure hydrocodone effect, but they're getting really close. So my advice would be, if you haven't touched kratom, don't touch it at all, ever. If you are taking kratom, you need to take note of what we just discussed. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these, Ask Me Anything sessions plus, to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research. In particular, research done on human beings. So not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels. Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth. And allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And, again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Transcript Language: English
Andrew Huberman: [INTRO THEME MUSIC] Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Maya Shankar. Dr. Maya Shankar is a cognitive scientist who did her undergraduate training at Yale University, her PhD thesis as a Rhodes Scholar, and a postdoctoral fellowship also in cognitive science at Stanford University. Dr. Shankar also served as a senior advisor to the White House, and she founded and served as the Chair of the White House Behavioral Science team. Dr. Shankar is also the host of her own podcast, entitled A Slight Change of Plans. And indeed, Dr. Shankar herself is no stranger to having to make major changes to one's life plans, as you'll learn today. Prior to all of those incredible accomplishments that Dr. Shankar has achieved, she was a student at the Juilliard Conservatory of Music, preparing her life to become a professional concert violinist, but as you'll also soon learn, she then experienced a career-devastating injury, forcing herself to have to reframe everything about her life plans and her own identity. And that's really what we talk about today. We talk about identity. Not just Dr. Shankar's prior and current identities, but, of course, your identity. We pose a number of questions geared toward getting you to ask, who am I really? Do my goals align with who I am and what I want? Dr. Shankar shares with us the research on identity, goals, motivation, and plans, as well as many practical tools to answer those key questions that guide us down either the correct or incorrect trajectories in life. She shares with us, for instance, how to assess on paper goals of the sort that you would see on a CV. So, which school, which job, which salary, which spouse, etc., etc. and how to relate those to the deeper feelings that relate to one's ability to continually pursue a given goal, knowing that it's the right goal for us. We also talk about the science of feelings, what they can and cannot tell us and when they should or should not serve as a compass for guiding our everyday and longer-term decisions. By the end of today's episode, you will realize that Dr. Shankar is essentially handing you a science-supported roadmap for how to determine and assess your identity and goals and how one influences the other. That is, how your identity influences your goals and how your goals influence your identity in becoming the person that you want to be. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast, in solo episodes and with guests about the need to get approximately 1 gram of high-quality protein per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition. Now, there are many different ways that one can do that, but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that by ingesting excessive calories. Maui Nui Venison has the highest density of quality protein per calorie, and it achieves that in delicious things like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky and bone broth. I particularly like the ground venison. I make those into venison burgers probably five times a week or more. I also like the jerky for its convenience, especially when I'm traveling or I'm especially busy with work and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient dense, high-quality source of protein. If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison, you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman and get 20% off your first order. Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. Sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance. When we're sleeping well, and enough, everything in life goes much better. And when we aren't sleeping well or long enough, things in life get worse. We know that from data. We all know that from our own experience. One of the essential things to getting a great night's sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment needs to be such that your core body temperature drops by about one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, and then increases by one to three degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. With Eight Sleep smart mattress covers, you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment so that it's ideally matched to your temperature needs. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover a few years ago and it has completely transformed the quality of the sleep that I get. So much so that I actually loathe traveling because I don't have my Eight Sleep mattress cover when I travel. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman, and you'll save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the U.S.A., Canada, U.K., select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Dr. Maya Shankar. Welcome. I'm so happy you're here. Maya Shankar: Thanks, Andrew. It's great to be here. Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of questions about identity, about goals and motivation, and about change in general, but I'd like to start off with identity, and I'd like to divide it into two segments. The first is how we form an identity, and we'll get into your story in, I hope, a bit or more of detail, but when we're younger, we tend to ask questions about ourselves, but also about the world around us. We want to learn what our parents do for a living, what the workers on the street are doing that for, etc. How much of our early identity do you think is formed by observation of what we are doing versus observation and labels of the people that are around us and closest to us? Maya Shankar: Yeah, it's a great question. I think a lot of it is based on what we see around us, and what we see is deemed successful and society privileges. And there's a concept called identity foreclosure, where actually, when you're young, it's not just that you're observing what your parents are doing or what your peer group is doing, they impose their own structures on you. And so what that can do is it can really limit your mindset in terms of what it is that you want to achieve and what it is that you're capable of achieving. And so oftentimes when people experience identity foreclosure, they have to take a lot of active steps to overcome whatever biases or limitations they experienced as a young person, given what they were projected to do or believe. So, identity, it can be about what you do. It can also be about what you believe in the world, and so a lot of those belief systems are also passed down. You inherit belief systems from the people that surround you when you're young, and if there's one thing that I've learned, it's that we tend to put a huge premium on what it is that we do. We tend to define ourselves by what we do. And you can see this in the questions we ask young children. What do you want to be when you grow up? We never say, who do you want to be when you grow up? What kind of person do you want to be when you grow up? We say, what do you want to be? And the consequence of that kind of mindset is that we end up anchoring our identities very firmly to what it is that we do. You were alluding to my personal story, right? I started playing the violin when I was a little kid, six years old, became absolutely obsessed, and for the large part of my childhood, I was first and foremost a violinist. I mean, if I had met you, I'd be like, hey, Andrew, I'm a violinist. And then the second up would be, I'm Maya. That's how tethered my identity was to being a violinist. And then fast-forward to when I'm a teenager. I have these huge dreams of going pro and becoming just, like, hopefully, a professional violinist for the rest of my life. And then I tear a tendon in my hand. My dreams end overnight, and suddenly there's this profound loss of identity, because what I hadn't realized is that in losing the violin, sure, I was losing the ability to play the instrument, but I was actually losing a huge part of who I was, and that was so destabilizing and so disorienting for me, because when you define yourself by the what, then as soon as the what goes away, you're like, oh, my gosh, who the hell am I? Andrew Huberman: What do I do? What value do I bring to the world? And what I experienced at the time is known in cognitive science as identity paralysis. Maybe you felt this way during various transitions in your life, but basically, who you are and what you're about is suddenly called into question, and you end up feeling really stuck. You don't have the courage to imagine what a future could look like, and I certainly fell prey to identity paralysis. And it took me a long time to kind of figure out what my path would look like moving forward, but I learned a really valuable lesson from that very formative experience I had with change about how it is that I should define myself. And for what it's worth, I don't think our desire as humans to have identities is going anywhere. We're not going to be able to dispose of identities, and we shouldn't, because our self-identities bring us so much meaning and purpose in our lives. Maya Shankar: You're a podcaster. I'm a podcaster. You're a scientist. I'm a scientist. These things are actually really helpful and motivating. So we don't want to do away with identities altogether, but what we can be more particular about is what we anchor our identities to. And I have learned in my adult life to anchor my identity to why I do the things I do rather than what I do. And I found this to be a much more durable, reliable relationship. So to make this concrete, let's think about the violin. Sure, I loved playing. I loved how music sounded. I loved the way the violin felt. But when I stripped away all the superficial features of the violin, what I really, really loved and was so drawn to as a young child was the emotional connection that I could form through my music. So that might have been with my orchestra mates, my chamber musician friends, playing solo and performing in front of an audience. And ideally, we all feel something new that we haven't felt before. It's kind of an intoxicating feeling when you're little to have the ability to inspire new feelings in people, right? And I was so drawn to human connection, and when I realized that human connection was at the heart of what it is that drives me as a person. Like, what lights me up every single day is a desire to connect with others, to understand other people, to understand their psychology, to understand how their minds work. Then when the violin was taken away from me, even in terms of the narrative I tell myself about my life, I could still find that same core underlying feature elsewhere, and I have been able to. I found it as an academic, as a cognitive scientist who studies the science of connection and emotion. I've seen that connection play out in the work that I did in public policy when I was at the White House. Obviously, with my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. You're forming these intimate connections with people every day. And so even though it feels in my life like I've done such disparate things, there actually is a powerful through line that connects all of them, and that is my desire to connect emotionally. And so what I would recommend to people who are listening, especially if they're in the throes of change, and they're feeling destabilized by that threat to identity, that loss of identity, is to try to figure out what their through line is. What are the underlying features of the things that you used to do that you absolutely loved? And can you find the expression of that elsewhere? Andrew Huberman: I love that, and I have so many questions. The first one relates back to childhood identities and how we often can project onto children what they are likely to become. I see that as mostly benevolent. You observe a child playing with trucks in the sandbox, and we say, oh, they're going to become a contractor. We tend to project roles that are fairly high up within the occupation hierarchy. Like any parents, you wish for the best possible life for your kids. But I can see the perils of doing that if then the kid starts to think, well, that's what I'm bound to become, because it is restrictive. I also am fascinated by the fact that when we are adolescents and teens, there's a tendency to ask questions about identity, like, who am I? I don't know many 40-year-olds that say, who am I? At one's core, one's essence, and we might change careers, change relationships, change geographies, all sorts of things. But there must be something going on in the brain in those adolescent and teen years that forces this question of self, of who am I? And teenagers are notorious for trying on different uniforms, different friend groups, different behaviors, as a way to sort that out, sometimes in ways that support them and sometimes in ways that act as pitfalls. So I'm curious about what's known about how we develop our own identity from the inside out as well as from the outside in. Maya Shankar: Yeah, no, that's really interesting, and it's also something I'm very curious about. I mean, we know from neuroscience research that there are significant changes that the brain undergoes during puberty and other periods of adolescence, and the primary change that we see is a desire for independence. And so one reason why we see teenagers grappling with this question of who I am is that they're actually breaking from these structures that they grew up around. The imposed structures, the identity foreclosure that they might have experienced and are starting to figure out for the first time, or wanting to ask the question for the first time, who do I want to be? What do I want to do outside of the systems that I've grown up in? And I think this is one of the primary reasons why we find that during teenage years, this sort of question is asked more commonly. I think that one challenge that we can face, because you said this one word that really caught my attention, which was, what's my essence? And one of the things I studied as a cognitive scientist, is the psychology of what's called essentialism. So our underlying belief is that there are essential qualities to people that are immutable, and there's lots of studies with young children and adults showing that we really believe that people do have these essences. And it's unclear what that even means in a metaphysical sense, I don't know what that would even mean. I think that the challenge in believing that we have essences is that it leads us to believe that there are these truly immutable states about ourselves that we're incapable of changing, and I think this can give rise to feelings of shame, for example. So what is shame? Shame is not the feeling, oh, I did something bad. Shame is the feeling, I am bad. It's not that I lost at something, I failed at something, it's that I'm a loser, I'm a failure. And so the problem when we try to figure out the essence piece is that it doesn't give you the kind of malleable way of thinking that actually there might not be something that's so defining about you that you're incapable of changing. As humans, maybe all we are are collections of behaviors and thoughts. And there's nothing more to it than that. And I find that way of thinking a bit more freeing when it comes to who we are, because I think it allows us to cultivate more of a growth mindset. I think it prevents us from engaging in these very harmful self-narratives that a lot of people tend to have about themselves. Probably a lot of people listening to your podcast are self-critical. I'm a very self-critical person. We listen to this because we want to improve. I'm a fan of your show because I want to be better and I want to improve. But that also is often accompanied by a lot of self-berating and questioning of self. And so, yeah, I think I've just tried to have a slightly more capacious understanding of who I am and also recognizing that there might not really be these essential features that are immutable. I don't know if you resonate with this notion of the desire to feel that we have essences? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I used the word essence without thinking too carefully about exactly what I meant, but what I was trying to say when I said essence is as a child, I did certain things, and I enjoyed some of them, didn't enjoy others, and I really disliked others. A very famous neuroscientist who's at Caltech named Markus Meister, people literally refer to him as the great Markus Meister, once said, and I totally subscribe to the fact, that neural circuits in the brain basically divide our sensory experience along the dimensions of yum, yuck and meh. There's not a lot of in between, because the circuits ultimately have to drive either forward movement toward more repetitive behaviors, as in nerdspeak, or aversive leaning out, I don't want that. Or just kind of a neutral response, a yum, yuck and meh seems to be the trinary response. And there is this component of childhood, I think, where we are foraging naturally, using our senses, experiencing yum, yucks and mehs and hearing yum, yucks and mehs from our parents. That's good, that's bad, that's whatever. It's neutral. But at some point, I certainly have had the experience and I've observed others, I think, having the experience of feeling something that's on a different dimension entirely, which is this notion of delight, which is that it sort of fills your body with a sense of so much yum that it gives you energy to do so much more of it in a way that is almost on a different plane. And I'm not trying to be spiritual or metaphysical about it, but it feels distinctly different. And I don't know what it represents, but I think that's that piece that perhaps, even as a scientist, I don't really need to assign a neural circuit to. Maya Shankar: Sure, do you think what you're describing in part is the feeling of awe? Like, when you talk about delight, do you think part of it is a feeling of awe? Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Like the first time I went to New York City as a six-year-old kid, I remember thinking, and I still feel every time I'm there, I can't believe this place exists. It's like a human tropical reef. Like everywhere you look, there's life. So that was awe and delight. Although I saw some things, this was New York in the '70s, there were some things like Times Square in the '70s. If anyone's seen that show, "The Deuces," it looked like that, especially as a young kid, it was kind of aversive. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: So it wasn't always awed, but the delight for me was in learning, and certain animals and certain things for you as the violin. And I want to make sure that I-- -- Maya Shankar: And awe, by the way, I mean, it can be aversive. So awe isn't necessarily, I think, in the Western world, we think of awe-inspiring experiences as having a positive emotional valence, but they can also have a negative emotional valence. So, the two criteria for satisfying an awe-inspiring experience, and a lot of this work comes from Dacher Keltner, professor at Berkeley, is one, there should be some element of perceived vastness. This is all reference dependent. So it's all based on your own frame of mind, but there's this sense of mystery and wonder at just how vast either the physical apparatus is, like Times Square. It's this massive set of buildings, and it kind of overwhelms your senses because of all the lights and sounds that are hitting your visual system and your auditory system. There's also conceptual vastness. So we can feel awe when we feel the delight of a new scientific discovery, right? Or in my case, like for the first time reading a book about how the mind works. I just remember marveling at this organ and just being completely in awe of how it works. And then the second criteria for an awe-inspiring experience, which I think might have been met as well when you were in New York, is what's called a need for accommodation. So it's just a fancy way of saying that we have a certain mental model of the world. And typically in the presence of awe, we need to assimilate this new information with our existing model because it challenges it in some way. And it actually leads us to have more open minds because we realize, wait a second, I have this existing vision of what the world is like and now I'm experiencing this new thing and I need to kind of make it work. I need to integrate it with my existing understanding of the world and that's the mind-blowing part of it. But I absolutely remember my childhood experience kind of mirroring your experience in New York, I was twelve years old or maybe eleven years old. I was at a summer music camp. It was late at night. I had my Discman, which is how we listened to things back in the day. I recall I had a CD in there. It was the Beethoven violin concerto by Anne Sophie Mutter. I was so young, Andrew, so I still don't know how to use words to describe how it is that I felt something that was so powerful and so transcendent. But I remember listening to the first movement of this violin concerto and it consumed me. I mean, I felt chills up and down my spine. My heart would race along with the melody. It felt otherworldly, right? And I think that was kind of what you're getting at before where it's like it's this altered state of mind. And the language I've used since to code that experience is that it was an awe-inspiring experience because I think both things happened. I was impressed by the vastness of the experience. It also sent me through time in this interesting way, back to the time of Beethoven. So the vastness can exist along a temporal horizon and then the need for accommodation, which, you know, I didn't study cognitive science at this point. So I remember thinking, I cannot believe a collection of musical notes arranged just so can make me feel this way and that if you were to tweak it just slightly, just like, take the E flat and move it down the stream a little bit, emotional resonance is completely gone from the passage. And there was just something so simple and magical about that realization. So, anyway, I resonate with this kind of delight and awe experience that you describe. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'm so glad you described it. That, you know, this isn't a discussion about my experience, but for me, I realize now that New York was awe-inspiring. Prior to that, the only thing similar was discovering animal specialization, something I'm still fascinated by, the sensory systems of animals and how they experience the world and how humans experience the world. And then ultimately, it was, well, then I went into skateboarding and that whole landscape, and then eventually into neuroscience. The difference between the New York experience of awe, and I do think that that's what it was, and biology, animals, and eventually neuroscience, is that, like your experience with music and realizing that the movement of a note could change something fundamentally, when it came to learning about biology and neuroscience, I felt not just awe, but a sense of delight in that. I felt there was a place for me there. And what came out of what you just described really resonated in terms of this moving of a note, because it took something from a passive experience, I believe, of that's this incredible thing over there, like New York City, was awe. But I didn't see myself having any kind of verb state within it that would change it or alter how it is, or for me. Whereas with music, for you or, I think, neuroscience, when I realized that you could do experiments, you could actually do some sort of manipulation, and through that, hopefully unveil something fundamental about how the brain works, I thought, there's a place for me here. And so I think there's something about the experience of something just from a raw sensory perspective, music or animals or neuroscience in the examples we're using here. But then realizing that there's a verb state of self like that, I could enact something within it that could give me more of that. Whereas I think when, as a young kid in New York City, I just didn't feel any way that I could plug into it except in a passive way, because it's the difference between a kid who — and this wouldn't have been me — who sees a game of soccer or football or baseball or watches the Olympics and goes, that is amazing, and the kid that says, I'm going to go do that, in fact, I could do that, and I could maybe do that even better, or even half as well. And so the delight, I think, is in the possibility of engagement, and I'm fascinated. A friend of mine who's a trauma therapist, he's not a neuroscientist. He always says nouns are just very slow verbs, but verbs are far more exciting because they create this anticipatory activity. Anyway-- -- Maya Shankar: Before you move on from that, I love that you said that, because you're helping me realize something really important about how I saw my role as a violinist. I'm never going to modify the notes on the page, because obviously, I'm going to be faithful to what Beethoven wrote. Andrew Huberman: This is what made you a great musician. And me, by the way, I was a failed violinist. They pulled me out of it because the neighbor's dogs howled. I was in the Suzuki method. I was so terrible at it that they literally made me stop playing music just to protect the neighborhood. Maya Shankar: That's adorable. And we'll talk about the science of quitting. Maybe later, but that was a great choice for you. But what I'm realizing is that there was that element of defining self through the pursuit of the instrument. And I saw a place for myself exactly like you did, where I thought, I decide how this phrase unfolds. I decide how much vibrato I use. I decide exactly what the angling of my bow is and the cadence and the pacing and the emotion that I bring to the experience. And when you see a place for yourself, that takes an awe-inspiring experience. And then, actually, there's a translation process where you become something bigger than what you thought you could be. And actually, it's so interesting you mentioned this, Andrew, because I've been chatting recently with a guy named Reginald Dwayne Betts, and he spent nine years in prison, and he's now an internationally renowned scholar. So he committed a carjacking when he was 15 years old and then went to an adult prison for nine years. Andrew Huberman: As a 15-year-old? Maya Shankar: He just turned 16 by the time he got his sentence. Yeah, it was totally wild. Andrew Huberman: Brutal. Maya Shankar: And he actually talks about the fact that there was this underground library in the prison system, and he didn't know what he could be in the prison, what identity he could take on when everyone seemed to be defined by what crime they had committed. It felt like his imagination was so limited to the... talk about identity paralysis. I mean, you're denied all your basic freedoms in this environment, right? So you really don't even have the ability to imagine what more you could be. So one day he gets a book called "The Black Poets." And in the book, he read a poem by Etheridge Knight, who had also spent time in prison and had written this incredibly stirring poem about the criminal justice system. And he goes by Dwayne, but what Dwayne shared with me is he said, I was awe-inspired by what I was reading. But the most important thing that happened in reading that book and understanding the author's history is that it gave me something to be. I saw a place for myself in this world. And he was so prolific. He wrote like a thousand poems in the year after he stumbled upon this book, and he ended up winning the MacArthur Genius Award. He went to Yale Law School. I mean, he's just crushed it ever since. But I think you've stumbled upon a really important point, which is there's a fascinating science of awe and all the benefits it can confer to our well-being, but it can also serve as an entry point to helping to define our identities in new places. And I just love that. I think that's a wonderful way to think about it. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. When we see ourselves entering the sphere of experience that is evoking awe, I do think something about it converts to this delight. Although I have to acknowledge that language is insufficient to describe a lot of what we're referring to. Right. Even the most reductionist language of biology can't grab the higher order emotions and complexity. Not yet, anyway. We just don't have a language for it. I'd like to talk more about the violin, not just because I failed miserably at the violin, but actually, I figured out pretty early on I wasn't going to be a musician. I still have absolutely no ability to read music. I can memorize lyrics very easily, and I love music, and I love classical music as well as other forms of music, but zero musical talent. You, on the other hand, got quite good at violin. It was interesting for me to learn that the violin was a bit of a rebellious choice for you, given your family history. And you and I do both share this fairly unusual fact that both of our fathers are theoretical physicists. So did you feel pressured to be a scientist or something else? And being a musician, was that initially looked at as a route to poverty or a bad choice, or were your parents a bit more cautious, like, oh, okay, that's great, but maybe make that a supplement to your other studies and pursuits. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So I'm the youngest of four kids, and kind of stereotypically, my three older siblings were total math whizzes, they were, you know, taking the SAT when they were very young because they were so talented. But I think one antagonist to some of those cultural forces is that my mom, when she had grown up in India, had felt very stifled by her environment. Like, as a young woman who was very capable and very smart, I mean, she majored in physics. She was mostly kept to the spaces of domestic chores, occasional singing lessons. But mostly her job was like, do your homework and then help with cooking. Right, and cleaning and whatnot. And so when she moved to this country with my dad in the 1970s, she was actually very excited. She was 21 years old, by the way. So, long story short, she had met my dad 20 days prior to their getting married. So it was an arranged meeting. And my dad is doing his postdoc at Harvard in physics at the Society of Fellows. And my mom just joins him after a winter break in the dorm. And everyone's like, hey, man, how was your break? And there's like, I went snowboarding and I went, whatever, to Tahoe. And my dad's like, I got married. And so this new couple arrives, and my mom was so lonely in this country. I mean, this was before you could text your parents overseas or use a WhatsApp group. So she could only handwrite letters to her family back home. And her goal was, you know what? I'm going to create a little army around me in the form of children. So she had four kids, and she was absolutely intent on exposing us to as many extracurricular activities as she could. So I have two older brothers and I have an older sister, especially her girls. She said, you can do whatever you want. I'm going to give you lay of the land when you're young, but when you find something that you're passionate about, I really want to give you the opportunity to explore it. So I think I really benefited from the fact that she had been denied that kind of exposure and the ability to pursue her dreams, artistic or otherwise. And so she was really hell-bent on making sure that we kids were able to. My older three siblings played musical instruments, so, like clarinet, trumpet, flute. I think they were surprised by my affinity for it because when I was six, my mom brought down my grandmother's violin from the attic. So my grandmother had played Indian classical music. So that's where you're sitting cross-legged on the floor and your violin's facing the ground. It's a very different style of music. But as, like, a parting gift, my grandmother had given it to my mom and said, hey, bring this with you to the U.S. So she opened the instrument that day, and I just instantly fell in love with it. And I asked very quickly for a quarter-size violin of my own. And while my parents had to nudge me to do all sorts of things, they really never had to push me to practice, which felt extraordinary at the time. Like, okay, clearly the violin is something that Maya has intrinsic motivation for, because how is it that we're not asking her to have to practice all the time? Similar to you, Andrew, I never to this day, I have a really hard time reading music. I never, I was a terrible sight reader. I couldn't, if you put a piece of music in front of me, I would not be able to tell you probably what it would sound like. Today, I learn entirely by ear. So I started with the Suzuki method, which, as you know, is entirely by ear. And then I had an extremely kind, awesome, but very inexperienced teacher. I was his first student. My mom went backstage at a symphony concert in New Haven, which is where I grew up, and just asked the concertmaster, like, hey, will you teach my daughter? And he's like, sure. Never taught anyone before, but I'll give this a go. And so we just made things up along the way. I mean, he would play stuff and I would mimic it, and I would let my emotions and whatever innate musicality guide me. And eventually, I think what that did actually is really interesting, from a skill-building perspective my technique absolutely suffered in the long term from not having a more structured approach, but I was able to fall in love with this endeavor much more quickly than other kids who had drill sergeants that were forcing them to practice their scales every day and practice etudes. I mean, that stuff is so boring, right? And when you're a little kid, you just want to bang your head against the wall when you're put up against that, when there's so many barriers to actually enjoying the fun parts, which are actually playing the pieces. So the one kind of fun aside about my musical journey is I got to jump straight to the fun stuff, and I think that helped me cultivate a much more natural love of the instrument. Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin-mineral-probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. From now until August 12th, 2023, AG1 is giving away ten free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman , you can claim the special offer of ten free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2. The intrinsic motivation part is so key. I've talked a few times before on the podcast about this. I think of a now-famous study that was done at Bing Nursery School, at Stanford, where they observed what kids did during free time, and then they rewarded them or didn't reward them, and then they later removed the rewards. And the essential takeaway is that receiving rewards for something that a child was initially intrinsically motivated to do undermines some of that intrinsic motivation. So I have to wonder whether or not the fact that your parents neither encouraged nor discouraged your violin playing might have allowed you to fully express and lean into your intrinsic motivation, as opposed to... for instance in my case, we are distantly related, not closely related, but there is a great violinist by the name of Bronislav Huberman, who has a street named after him in Israel. There's a famous picture of him and Einstein playing violin together. And I was told about that early on. And when I failed to play well after a couple of practices, I was convinced that there was no way I was going to live up to it, and I quit. Maya Shankar: That's a high bar. Andrew Huberman: It's a high bar. Maya Shankar: I didn't have any such role models that I was trying to be like in my family. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, it turns out, but exactly! And so I think that there's actually more opportunity in kids leaning into, and adults probably leaning into the sensory experience of what they're doing and not putting that up against some benchmark. I worry about that today so much with social media and with video games, where in a video game we're on social media, you can see something being done at the very highest level, often by someone quite young or early in their career, to the point where it can be a little bit overwhelming. And I think then we start measuring ourselves against metrics that are not about the experience. That said, your parents, whatever they did worked out well enough that you became very proficient, right? You succeeded in getting into Juilliard, which, at least from my understanding, is the most competitive music preparatory, is that how you refer to it, that one can possibly go to? And so at that point, had your identity merged with the behavior, and were you still enjoying yourself up until the point where you had this injury? That we'll also talk about. Maya Shankar: Yeah, I was still enjoying myself around the time when I auditioned for Juilliard, in particular, because of exactly what you said, which was that everything was kind of beating my expectations and my parents' expectations up until this point. Which is that we didn't really have any, and so it all just felt like icing on the cake. Wow! Our kid's found something that they really love. This is great, right? It can sometimes take you years, decades, to figure out what it is that you love, what you're passionate about. And I think we go through this renewal process often in our lives. I've had to have moments in life where I'm like, what do I like again? What do I love again? And so it's not also a onetime experience, but there was a thrilling aspect to my musical life when I was young, which was, again, everything kind of felt like, it's like, a bonus. So one story I love sharing is about how I even got into Juilliard in the first place. So my dad's a theoretical physicist, as you mentioned. My mom helps immigrants get green cards to study in this country. Neither of them had exposure to the classical music sphere. So they're, like, the opposite of tiger parents. Like, even if they wanted to be tiger parents, they wouldn't know how to be tiger parents in this domain, because they lack the connections and the wherewithal to figure out what it would mean to go pro and to access the best teachers or whatever. So my mom, who is a very fearless person by nature, she knew that at some point, my passion for the violin was surpassing her ability to connect me with the right resources. And so one weekend, we were in New York, awe-inspiring New York, and I had my violin with me because I had another audition, and we were just walking by Juilliard, the building. And my mom was just eager for me to see it from the outside because it's just really cool as a kid, right? It's like, all your musical idols went to this place. I just wanted to see it and imagine what it would have been like for Perlman to go in and out and Midori to go in and out, Yo-Yo Ma, like, it's so exciting. And as we're passing the entrance, my mom looks at me and says, hey, why don't we just go in? And I was like, what are you talking about? She's like, let's just go in. What's the worst thing that can happen? And I'm like, security guards and a lot of other terrible things, Mom, right? But I had a useful enthusiasm that propelled me into the building that day. She strikes up a conversation with a fellow student and her mom, finds out that she's studying with a top teacher at Juilliard, asks if we can get an introduction. Within an hour, I'm auditioning for this teacher on the spot. Right. No idea that this was going to happen. Andrew Huberman: Wild! Maya Shankar: Yeah, he tells me... he has what I refer to as a muted enthusiasm about my playing. Doesn't think I'm great, but, sees something, he told me later he liked my personality, my enthusiasm. So I got the personality card coming out of that music audition. Great. And what he did is he said, look, I'm with you. I don't think that you're ready. You would not get into Juilliard if you auditioned today. However, I take residence at a summer music program in Colorado. If you come there for five weeks, we can do an intense boot camp where I try to skill you up and get you to learn your first scale and your first etude, which you will need to pass the Juilliard audition, and also maybe, hopefully get you to read music a little bit better than you can right now. And I went to that summer camp, and I worked my butt off. I mean, you're also in this incredibly intensive environment where everyone your age is there and they're all practicing like their age equivalent, right? And so I felt very inspired by that. And I ended up getting into Juilliard in the fall. And it was such a wonderful reminder that when opportunities are not served on a silver platter for you, you just have to have this kind of imaginative courage. And what my mom had that day. To figure out a path from point A to point B, she really just created a plate for me and said, like, okay, you're prepared for this thing. We're going to get you in front of this teacher. And that's a lesson I've used time and time again. When I felt like there was something cool I could be doing, the opportunity did not exist. So, for example, when I was in the White House, the job that I wanted, which was to be a practitioner of behavioral science, did not exist. And so I sent cold emails and I pitched them on the idea of creating a new position for a behavioral science advisor. And then I said, hey, by the way, if you create this position, could you also consider hiring me to play that job, even though I've had no public policy experience and I've been an academic for the entirety of my adult life? And they said yes. And so it was such an energizing lesson to learn as a young kid, which is like, you can do the cold call. Oftentimes there's few consequences. You'll just get rejected. I mean, that's truly the worst thing that's going to happen. But it's one thing to be told that, it's another thing to have lived the experience out and to see how amazing the aftermath can be. And that's what I got to experience as a young kid. Andrew Huberman: Amazing. So let's all express some thanks to your mom for barging in the door, and to you, because you also had the agency to do the audition on the spot. I think a lot of kids and adults would have thought, I'm not ready, I'm not going to do this, but it takes a certain gumption to just do it, right, and also to integrate the feedback. And then I'm curious about this camp. I went to a few camps of different types, crashed a few camps. That's a different story. Turns out if you show up, you can get by for a few days before they realize that you're not one of the main, oh, yeah, no, there's a whole other set of stories there. Maya Shankar: I love it. Andrew Huberman: But I'm curious. You're among very driven, maybe even obsessive kids. Were they nice to one another? Do you recall the kid that was the best? Maya Shankar: Oh, yeah. Rachel Lee. Andrew Huberman: There you go. Isn't this incredible? Maya Shankar: Oh, my God. Andrew Huberman: We remember these names. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Total prodigy. I bristle when people say, Maya was a young violin prodigy. I'm like, no, I wasn't. And there's no false humility in my saying that. I just actually saw what prodigies were like and I was not one of them. I mean, truly, just talk about awe-inspiring. I'm like, how is it that music comes so effortlessly to Rachel? I feel like she was born with a violin in her hands. I mean, that's how it felt whenever I watched her play. And it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you're deriving inspiration from the incredible talent you see around you. On the other hand, you feel demoralized so often because you're running up against whatever limitations exist when it comes to your natural talent and your work ethic. At the end of the day, I was never the hardest working violinist. My mom insisted that we were well-rounded kids. I played soccer all through elementary school. I auditioned for the school play, "Really Rosie," I did art classes. It was just really important to both my parents. I think that we had just, like, relatively normal lives. And I was studying alongside kids who had literally left half their families behind in their home country, had moved with one parent to a studio apartment in Manhattan or in Colorado for this camp, and were devoting their entire lives to this pursuit. And so I felt like, I was a super envious kid. Like, I was always looking around, being like, I suck, and they're great, right? We talked about having a self-critical personality-- -- Andrew Huberman: I think a lot of kids feel that way. I think at that age, and this sometimes extends into adulthood, we have this tendency to try and find benchmarks of where we are. And sometimes that turns into a hierarchical thing, sometimes very lateralized. But trying to figure out where you are in the landscape of things, it just seems like it's fundamental to the teenage experience. Maya Shankar: Yeah, your universe shrinks, too, right? So you're no longer getting access to what the average kid violinist sounds like. I mean, you're in the elite of the elite. And so it's so intimidating. And I felt like what happened is, especially when I became a teenager, so two things happened when I became a teenager. The first is that my violin life just started to speed forward. So Itzhak Perlman invited me to be his private violin student, considered the best violinist in the world. It was an incredible experience. I felt so overwhelmed, even by the opportunity. I'd also stumbled upon MTV and was like, do I even want to do classical music? Like, Britney Spears is doing much cooler things? So that was my version of teenage rebellion, was coming home from school, and when I should have been practicing, watching MTV. But the other thing that happened is I went through the natural teenage process, which is I became very self-conscious. I became more insecure. I was trying to figure out who I was, who I am. And I think that was the period of my life, my high school years, when I was the least happy as a violinist. So I described to you earlier that incredibly awe-inspiring experience of listening to the Beethoven violin concerto and it feeling otherworldly and feeling like I could see a world beyond my own personal wants and needs and desires. It really made me feel small against the backdrop of this magnificent world. And I liked that feeling of smallness. And when I was in my teenage years, we're all in this highly narcissistic state of mind. We're consumed with ourselves and how we feel. And I just felt like I gave some of my worst performances when I was a teenager. And I often found, to your point, about these pressure cooker environments. My best performances were actually just to the public. My worst performances were when I was in my little studio, having to play for my peers. That just sapped all the joy out for me because I was just, like, really tough on myself. And that was a period of time where I lost touch with what it is that I loved about music. And of course, there's an ebb and flow. I had magical experiences playing the violin when I was a high schooler. But I just think if you were to do the average of joy, like pre-12 and then post-12, the average joy was much higher before I became a teenager. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, there's so many things to extrapolate from that. I really feel that when we get into a mode of trying to hit milestones that are extrinsic, that it really can undermine our love of what we're doing. But if we keep going and we can reframe what those external rewards are, in part by just realizing that they're so transient compared to the delight that we can experience. What I mean is that I don't think of delight as something that wells up in us and then dissipates. I think of it as something that changes our nervous system in a way that gives us access to new abilities. I really do. I mean, being a faculty member at Stanford, you look to your left, you look to your right, and it's like literally in the building, I mean, I've got a Nobel Prize winner below me. Like the people by me, I've got MacArthur Award winners all over the place, like everywhere you turn, and these people do other things, too. So also D1 athletes, and they've got five kids, and all their kids seem to be doing great. Who are these people? And it becomes very important in that environment to just shrink your spirits, like, what's one foot in front of you and just keep going and not pay attention. But it's hard to do, not by way of comparison, because I actually get excited about being immersed in a group where everyone's doing well. I do think being among all these other incredibly talented and driven, although you carefully said, and importantly said rather, that you did not see yourself as talented, it's very clear that you have a ton of grit and hard work clearly went into it. I think that word talent can be a little bit misleading, so we want to underscore the fact that you've worked incredibly hard. But I think that it's a tough thing. It's hard for us to develop much in isolation, and it's also hard for us to stay connected to the source. Maya Shankar: Yes, exactly. Andrew Huberman: And that's a word that I stole from a former guest on this podcast and a good friend of mine who's the great Rick Rubin, one of the most successful music producers, rock and roll music producers, of all. Maya Shankar: I loved that interview. Andrew Huberman: He talks about the source, so there are so many different trails we could go down here. Just one thing, briefly, is I, again, am completely miserable at music, but I once saw Itzhak Perlman in the airport with his family. I was with my father, who's a huge classical music fan, and we watched him, and he said, watch. And it turns out he was getting onto our plane. He sat in first class next to his, I presume, Stradivarius violin. His violin got a first-class seat. He got a first-class seat, and his family sat across from him. And my dad said, his violin is so important that it gets its own first-class seat. I couldn't believe it. So great. In any event-- -- Maya Shankar: I think, just one thing to your point, one reflection I've had, and this kind of goes back to this question of identity, which is when you are in these very competitive environments, and again, I'm sure a lot of people listening are in very competitive environments, you feel that so much can be taken away from you, just in terms of mental well-being, because you're always looking at the world through a comparative lens. You're benchmarking yourself, as you said, like there's a benchmark, and where do I fall on the continuum of mediocre to great? I don't know, and yesterday I had a terrible performance, so that's going to set me back, etc., etc. I have found that when I reanchor myself to what Rick Rubin referred to as the source and identify the characteristics of music or other pursuits, that really energizes me. It feels like I'm actually insulated from a lot of the external noise, and I bring a lot more clarity and focus to the work that I do every day. So there's two things that I think define me as a person — at least right now, I allow for that malleability. One is that I'm a deeply curious person. And the second is that I really relish getting better at things. I love seeing progress internally. And in my violin life, no one could take those two things away from me. In my current life as a cognitive scientist, as a podcaster, you just can't take those from me. No one can take that joy from me. And it feels protective in a really important way, which is, for example, just like you. I mean, I see the labor of love that you put into the Huberman Lab podcast. It's extraordinary. I put so much time and energy and thoughtfulness and love into making A Slight Change of Plans, but at the end of the day, when you put the episode out into the world, you just don't get to control what the reaction is, right? Your favorite episode might not be everyone else's favorite episode, and that's just something you have to deal with. But what I found is that if I really relished the process of making the episode, it fed that curiosity. And I got better as an interviewer, I got better as a thinker. I got more clarity on a topic that I was curious about. I mean, it gives me a foundation that feels really sturdy. Do you know what I mean? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well, those things are intrinsic to you, and they are, I guess, now we're using nomenclature, but they're not what we would call domain specific, like the curiosity, the desire for progress through effort and through focus. Those are music. They're not music irrelevant, but they're music independent. And that actually brings me to a very important component of your work and your life arc, which is this notion of recreating and refinding identity in new endeavors. So if I understand correctly, and hopefully you'll embellish on this, you had the unfortunate, perhaps unfortunate experience of playing the violin and then injuring your finger very badly to the point where it was, at least for your music career, career-ending, absolutely. And that happened when you were how old? Maya Shankar: I was 15. Andrew Huberman: So given how much of your identity and energy was put into violin, that must have been devastating. And yet you've obviously, I don't want to say re-created yourself, because I like the idea that this essence within you has many opportunities and forms. And I like it as an example for everybody having some essence of many things that could give them delight, and that it's something about the feelings associated with a given choice of occupation or hobby or behavior, or perhaps relationship. Relationships end sometimes by decision, death or otherwise, and people are devastated. Their identities are completely, at least in their minds, obliterated. And then people have this amazing ability to re-create themselves and new circumstances. So if you could take us back to the time when you were 15, you have this injury. What was your initial mindset in the days and weeks after that, and then, if you would, could you link that up to some of what I see as incredibly important work that you've done, helping people understand not just who they are, but how to identify the components of who they are that are truly indomitable, that just cannot go away. Like, your drive for curiosity and hard work--. -- Maya Shankar: And human connection. Yeah. In the days and weeks and months and year after, I felt terrible. It was awful because I think, in my case, also, when you're a kid who's really bubbly and energetic, you just kind of move forward, and you don't always think about how identity-defining the thing you're doing is, you just do it. And so it was really interesting, I think, in losing the violin, that's actually when it became so salient to me how much the instrument had meant to me and had defined who I was. And so I felt a dampening of some of my more organic traits. Like, I was less curious for a long time. Andrew Huberman: I'm going to interrupt you on purpose. I apologize. But at the same time, I'm not apologizing, because there was something that you said in a prior discussion that just keeps ringing in my mind, which is that your body and your nervous system actually grew up around the violin. That, to me, was just... I will never forget that statement. I want to also thank you for it, because that, to me, is perhaps the most profound way to describe an experience of identity, is that your nervous system in your body isn't growing up with something or alongside it, but that much like a relationship of a human kind, humankind, that your body is actually developing around this object. Maya Shankar: It absolutely developed around the ergonomics of playing the violin. So, to this day, my right shoulder is slightly elevated relative to my left because of all the hours I spent doing this. It makes strength training really annoying because I always have this slight imbalance, and I have a light scoliosis in my spine as well, also from this posture. And, yeah, it feels intimate in a way. It's like, wow, the shape of my body. Like, my architecture was defined by this instrument. And so it's left this indelible imprint on me that will never go away. And I think that a lot of us feel this disorientation, right? So it might not be that you lost the ability to do something you love. It could be that you lost someone that you love. It could be that you lost your mojo or whatever. I mean, there's so many types of loss and so many kinds of grief we all experience as human beings. And I think in all those cases, again, it really feels like the rug has been pulled out from under you because this thing that gave you so much meaning and so much purpose and so much energy in life no longer exists. And so I think, for a while, yeah, I felt kind of like, lost at sea, and I assumed I'll never find anything that I'm as passionate about. And I think, what my dad did for me at that, you know, theoretical physicist. So he's an academic, and he said, I think you should just read a lot. Just, like, read a bunch of stuff. And I was like, okay, I mean, I'm supposed to be in China this summer touring with my classmates. I am at home in Connecticut with my parents, perusing their bookshelf. So, like, slightly less cool summer situation. But I had a lot of time on my hands because I wasn't in Shanghai. So I started perusing the bookshelf, and then I came across this pop-science book called "The Language Instinct," by Stephen Pinker. And that was a turning point for me. I mean, I was headed to college maybe later that year. I opened up this book, and it detailed our marvelous ability to comprehend and produce language. And up until this point in my life, I had completely taken language abilities for granted, just like something that I did, and I just kind of learned it along the way. And when Pinker pulled the curtain back and revealed how sophisticated and complex the cognitive machinery is that's operating behind the scenes that gives rise to language, my mind was truly blown. I was like, wow. I never thought about it, it's not like we are with three-year-olds, not like we sit down with them and we're like, this is a gerund. This is a past participle, whatever. They just learn because they have these kind of light switches in their brain that are activated on and off depending on what language they're learning. And it was so fascinating to learn about language development, about neurolinguistics, about syntax and semantics. I just remember thinking, language is fascinating. Cognition is fascinating. And I'm also now wondering about all these other systems that are in place. So this is what's involved in language. What's involved in the complex math equations our dads do, right? Like, what's involved in, what's the mental processing behind a new discovery or an insight or an aha moment or falling in love or falling out of love. I mean, it just lit up my imagination. And very similar to you, Andrew, I love that we have this connection. You said when you learned about neurobiology and neuroscience, you saw that there was a place for yourself in there. And I remember reading this book, and because it was a pop-science book, and I love pop-science books because sometimes, even if they don't fully do justice to the science, they can take someone who's never had any exposure to the subject matter, and it's thrilling to learn about the thing, right? I would never have gotten the same experience had I opened up an introduction to cognitive science textbook. It would not have had the same impact on me. So, like, shout out to pop-science folks everywhere. Andrew Huberman: Thank you for saying, just thank you, because I think that many of my colleagues in academic science at Stanford and elsewhere feel that way, but I think many don't. They think of it as "dumbing down" of things. But I'll tell you, rarely, if ever, does somebody just wander into a university classroom and hear a lecture by accident . [ Maya Shankar: LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: I mean, maybe if your mom was at the helm, they all would. So mom's everywhere, barge right in. But I think it's actually, I'll go a step further, and I'll do this so that you don't have to. And these are not your words. These are mine. I think that there's actually a pretty intense arrogance to the idea within the established scientific community that pop-science books, while they might not be exhaustive, provided they're accurate and they're making an attempt to educate and draw people in from all sectors, amen to that. I just can't hear a counterargument in my head or elsewhere where that's not one of the best things that people can do. So regardless of people's motivations for picking them up in the first place, I mean, they brought a lot of people into the curiosity and delight that is science or music or... I think that the more positive, benevolent, safe sensory experiences that we can expose young people to, the greater probability that we're going to flesh out those professions with the greatest number of diverse minds who are going to have the best ideas. I think that there's a ton of foresight in what you're describing, that picking up a book is now, you're also now a Ph.D. in cognitive science, and you did your postdoc at Stanford. I mean, you're a scientist, presumably because you went into the bookshelf and picked up that book. Maya Shankar: A hundred percent. And I think it was also role modeled for me because my dad, despite being in a very, very technical field, spent a large part of his career actually working on the translation of complex subjects and trying to convey them to general audiences. And I loved witnessing this because it's like, if you can figure out a way to communicate about theoretical physics to a general audience, I mean, wow, that's a masterful pursuit, right? Andrew Huberman: Feynman. Richard Feynman. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Richard Feynman. Exactly. Andrew Huberman: No one really knows what Feynman did for his Nobel Prize work except physicists. You know that most people, you ask them, what was Feynman's Nobel for? And they're like, I don't know. Maya Shankar: I don't know. Andrew Huberman: He said something about birds and taxonomy and how it's less interesting than, you know, quantum mechanics. Maya Shankar: And one of the reasons that I love Huberman Lab, and I just love the work you do, is that you are taking concepts that might have been inaccessible to the average person, and you're making science accessible. And I feel so much gratitude to every scientist out there, every researcher out there who thinks that it's worth their time to be a practitioner of their work. Because ultimately, think about how many lives you're changing through the show by trying to break down some of these more complicated things into concepts that people can understand and relate to and actually act on. And it also reminds me, part of my job when I was in the Obama administration was translating insights from behavioral science, from cognitive science into interventions that my government agency colleagues could implement in the Department of Veterans affairs, in the Department of Defense, Department of Education. And that same translation process was part of that effort, too. And I think it's really, really hard to do well. I respect it so much. I respect pop-science writers who do a good job so much. And yeah, I think it's a wonderful service. They don't have to spend their time writing these books. They could just publish more research papers, which is the currency that academic institutions care about. And so I see it as just like a public good, what they're doing. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I do, too. And right back at you, because you're doing it as well. And so we're all better off for it. So thank you. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones and so on. But you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is, to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etc. mean, and behavioral supplement, nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health. InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APO B and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So I want to go back to this injury, to summer at home, to discovery of something new. Was it at that point that you realized, the feeling of excitement that I'm getting from learning about neurolinguistics and related topics is somehow similar to the excitement that I was feeling about the violin, or maybe even superseded that excitement? I mean, at what point were you able to make the pivot with confidence that this is the new trajectory? And an important component of that that I'd like to understand is you also had to cut ties with the past, something that's very hard to do. I mean, I grew up with a number of kids who became very successful teen athletes, really. And some of them, once they ceased to keep up or they had an injury or something, their identity stayed attached to the past in a way that did not allow them to move forward. Fortunately, many of them did find new identities in business or in other endeavors. Some became quite successful. But I've seen very often that when people achieve early success and then they hit a cliff, that it's very hard for them to part with that former identity. There's one of the perils of early success. Maya Shankar: Yeah, I wouldn't say that it superseded the excitement that I had with the violin. I would say the quality of the excitement felt very different. And that's actually important to convey because I think when someone loses the ability to have a passion, they're seeking exactly the same sensory experience, exactly the same high that they experienced the first time around. And I think that's a really high bar. And sometimes it's more of an apples-and-oranges-type situation. So with the violin, there was a really deep sensory aspect to the experience. I mean, I felt things, right, you're playing and then you're feeling things emotionally. And it all felt super visceral, and that was where the passion emerged from. It was just this very visceral feeling of, like, this is so beautiful and awesome, and I love it. With the cognitive science stuff, my intellectual brain was delighted, and it's just like a different expression of passion. I think the big pressure test was not if I had held myself to the bar of, do I love this as much as the violin, there's no way that I would have been confident enough to pursue anything at that point. So instead, I really think the question I asked myself at that time, which was a service to me and my more compromised psychology, was, am I curious enough about this thing to ask more questions about it? Do I want to learn more? And I found, naturally, three days later, I went to the library, and I got another book on the cognitive science of language, and then I got a book on the science of decision-making. So there was curiosity, and honestly, that was all I needed. That was the little seedling that I needed to see if it could go somewhere more. I took that as a very strong signal. Like, I care to learn more about this, and I don't care to learn about everything, right? And I remember perusing the course book of my undergrad institution, and they had a cognitive science major, which was awesome because not all schools had one at the time. It was a very new major. It's interdisciplinary. You approach questions of the mind from multiple perspectives. So from the perspective of neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, computer science, and anthropology. So you're just like a bunch of different disciplines. But that was when I thought, ooh, I can at least see if I can get into this major. I remember it was, like, a selective major. It was selective. And so I freaked out, of course, and had super impostor syndrome. It was like, I'm not going to get into the program. But thankfully, I got in, and I think that's where I was able to connect, like, this little seedling of curiosity to the actual pursuit of the thing. And that's a really important translation, because there can often be a mismatch. You're really passionate about something, but you actually hate the process. Like, you hate the actual work that's involved in getting better at it. And I was lucky in my undergrad because I fought my way, my mom style, barging into classes that really would only accept seniors or juniors, and I was like, I'm a lowly freshman, but accept me. And I was able to run experiments on adults, and I was actually able to see what it would be like to be a researcher, to ask novel questions and to get the delight that you feel, right, when you're in a lab and you're actually testing out new hypotheses. And so it was really important that I saw that I not only was excited, but that I could actually enjoy parts of the process of getting better. Andrew Huberman: I love your description of curiosity because it makes me think that in some way, it has something to do with a deep motivation and desire to figure out what's next or what's around the corner without an emotional attachment to the outcome. Curiosity is really just trying to figure out what's there as opposed to hoping that something specific is there. And sometimes even the surprises are more exciting than our predictions. I think the quote was initially from Dorothy Parker. I think this is debated, but I think it was. "The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity." Maya Shankar: Oh, that's awesome. I hadn't heard that. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I believe it was Dorothy Parker, sometimes misattributed to Agatha Christie, but I think it was Dorothy Parker. And what I love about it is that there's something about curiosity, that when it's genuine, it's self-amplifying. It's an upward spiral, because there is no endpoint. Right? I mean, that's one of the things that you learn early in science, is you learn, you test hypotheses, you get answers, and you get more questions, and you form hypotheses, and you do that until you die, basically. And they can be a little bit dark. But when you think about it as a journey, that it's just so much fun along the way. If you're just really interested in knowing what the answers are without getting too attached to the answers, it just feels like, even as I'm describing it now, they just can just fill you up, and it provides more energy for the next round and the next round. And that really came through in your description of cognitive science. I also find it interesting that you couldn't read sheet music, at least not very well. You were so deeply immersed in an endeavor, violin playing, that is not of verbal language. And then you went into a field that's about, or initially, you were sparked an interest in a field through an understanding of verbal language. And earlier you said that the thing that bridges the violin and what came next as a passion and pursuit was this desire for human connection. At what point did you realize that? And here I do want to emphasize that while we're talking about your story, I hope, I can only imagine that people are starting to think about what are the intrinsic points of motivation for what they're doing and what they've done, asking the sorts of questions that I hope everyone is asking. What is it really that motivates me to love this and to see a place for myself in that? Because those are ultimately, I think, the questions that everyone should and can ask. Maya Shankar: Yeah, it took me a really long time. It's actually only been in the last few years that I've discovered this. I discovered this as a result of creating A Slight Change of Plans. So my desire to create the show came from a very personal place, which is that I'm terrified of change. So even though I've had these formative experiences with change, I'm a creature of habit. I'm willing to change my habits. For example, I now take caffeine 90 minutes after I get up. Andrew Huberman: How's that working for you? Maya Shankar: Very well, even today. Okay. I'm a good disciple. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Well, I like to think that people afford themselves some flexibility if you got to run to the airport-- -- Maya Shankar: Sixty to 90 minutes. [ Andrew Huberman: LAUGHS] Sixty and 90, or the occasional within 30 minutes if you have to, but nobody's perfect, nor should we strive. Maya Shankar: I'm a student. I'm willing to update my habits, but I'm a creature of habit. And there's a couple of reasons why we, as humans, are scared of change. And I think one of them, which is incredibly relatable, is that change is filled with a lot of uncertainty, and we hate uncertainty. We will go to irrational lengths to avoid uncertainty. So one of my favorite studies coming out of cognitive sciences is one involving electric shocks. And what they found is that people are far more stressed when they're told they have a 50% chance of getting an electric shock than when they're told they have a 100% chance of getting an electric shock. So we would rather be sure, certain that a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any feelings of uncertainty and ambiguity. Andrew Huberman: Right. That result, I love that you brought up that result. It still is bewildering to me, because if you think about it, 100% trial-to-trial shock means you have to take on the, okay, bring it, just bring it on kind of mentality. But if you did that for every trial, and then half of the trials, you don't get shocked. We know there's a dopamine release from the lack of punishment, so the ideal strategy is the same, and yet somehow, people are averse to the uncertainty. Maya Shankar: Yeah, we don't like uncertainty, even though, again, the uncertainty is what drives that dopamine first. And yet we bristle, certainly, at that uncertainty. And so I definitely am like, please, status quo, everyone, I would love the status quo. Even when the status quo has been suboptimal, Andrew, I've been fine with the status quo. So part of it came from my desire to figure out, okay, how is it... Like, A Slight Change of Plans, marries science and storytelling to help us figure out strategies for better managing change. So I wanted to figure out, how are people coming to terms with uncertainty? One of the things that I realized I learned from the guests on my show and also the scientists is there's this concept called cognitive closure, and it is the need to arrive at clear, definitive answers to things. It's basically the opposite of this open-ended curiosity that you just described, which is with cognitive closure, you have a need to, you aren't indifferent towards what the answers are. You aren't indifferent towards what the questions are. You care about everything. You care about micromanaging every part of the curious process from point A to point B. And there's a lot of research showing that when we reduce our need for cognitive closure, when we become a little bit more open to the unbidden, to mystery, more open to awe-inspiring experiences, we can experience huge boosts in well-being, and we can become a lot more resilient in the face of change. So that's something that I'm working on, which is like, okay, maybe I can reduce my need for cognitive closure. And the other thing that I am starting to appreciate is one reason that we get change wrong and we maybe fear it more than we should is that when we anticipate what a change will be like in the future, we tend to imagine how our present day selves will respond to that future change, right? So it's almost like a magic mirror. It's Maya in present day, going through this mirror, comes out the other side two years from now. She's the one who's overcoming the challenges of a diagnosis or some other life change. And what we forget is that the big changes in our lives can change us in pretty profound ways. And when we recognize and we all fall prey to this illusion. It's called the end-of-history illusion. So, this is work by Dan Gilbert. And basically what it says is we fully acknowledge that we've changed considerably in the past. So you think back to your skateboard days, right? I think back to my high school days, and I think, oh, my gosh, of course I've changed. I would be embarrassed to listen to any interview I gave when I was younger, right? Like, what were the thoughts I was even thinking? So we will see it, absolutely. We were totally different 10 years ago, 20 years ago. But when it comes to thinking about the future and projecting into the future, we are absolutely convinced that who we are right now in this moment is the person that's here to stay. And that can lead us astray when it comes to thinking about how we will respond to change, because we forget that there's actually a lot of wiggle room around who we become. And to your point, I mean, I love the point you made about curiosity. What that means is we want to be curious, not just about the things we do. We want to be curious about ourselves. One huge lesson that I've learned from the interviews that I've had on A Slight Change of Plans is that I need to constantly be auditing myself through my change experience to figure out how I have changed. Because when we experience change, it doesn't happen in a vacuum. So let's say I get a promotion or I enter into a relationship, or I leave a relationship or some other, again, narrow slice of my life is altered. We can think of that change as happening in a vacuum, right? As being confined to just the unique area of our life that change exists in. But, of course, we are incredibly complex creatures. Our psychology is incredibly complex. We live in these remarkably complex ecosystems. Change in one area of our life will inevitably have spillover effects into all other parts of our lives in ways that are extremely hard to predict. I think a lot of your listeners are familiar with the research showing we're really bad cognitive forecasters, right? We're bad at predicting what's going to make us happy, what's going to make us sad, how long we're going to be sad, how long we're going to be happy. Well, one of the reasons for that is that we forget that we are a dynamic entity that might change as well. That our preferences might change, our choice, that might change, we might change in these really profound ways that we don't realize. I think there's an inspiring message coming out of this, which is, one, what we're capable of right now really might not be what we're capable of later, and what I found in my own experience is that it's interesting when it comes to our self-perception, because we have a first-person perspective on who we are, we tend to think that we have a very comprehensive, veridical understanding of who we are. Like, I have a pretty good grasp of who I, Maya, am and what I'm capable of and what I value and what my identity is. But the reality is that that understanding is based on the random set of data points that I've happened to collect over the course of my lifetime, based on the random set of experiences and opportunities and failures and successes that I've happened to have. Right? Andrew Huberman: And if I'm not mistaken, there's a salience to the negative experiences, often for reasons that make sense according to nervous systems that want to keep us safe, etc. But, for instance, you remember the name of this child prodigy-- -- Maya Shankar: Rachel Lee. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Rachel Lee. [LAUGHS] My sister still talks about, I won't say their names because we know that these people are still around, fortunately, the names of some of the girls in junior high school that were particularly popular and perhaps not-- -- Maya Shankar: You mean Kellen Lindsay? [ LAUGHS] [ Andrew Huberman: LAUGHS] Yeah, perhaps not kind to her, right, exactly. Maya Shankar: Were they nice to me? Not super nice, but it's okay. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's a lot of web searching nowadays for what these people are up to now anyway. Not by me, anyway. I have a sister. We occasionally touch into this. She's doing great. Fortunately, there's a salience to the negative experiences. But I think what I'm hearing, and I totally agree with, is that we'd like to think that we have complete or at least adequate self-knowledge, but that we likely don't. What are some of the ways that we can get better data on ourselves in ways that can help us? Is that through the application of mentorship? Is it asking people for an honest assessment of us with, of course, the willingness to hear what they have to say? What are some of the, I love zero-cost behavioral, but what are some of the zero-cost behavioral sources that people have around them in order to ask these, what I think are really fundamental questions. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So there's two information asymmetries, let's say, that we're trying to solve for, so two areas where we might not have full knowledge of who we are for one of two reasons. So, one is that we have an incomplete understanding of who we are just based on the random set of experiences. And the second is that going through this big change actually alters us in some way. Okay, so if we're trying to solve for the ... I think the second problem is actually easier to solve for in that we often just don't even know to look inwards during a big change to see how we've changed because we think, oh, I'll just pay attention to how I'm performing at work because that was the new variable that was thrown into my life. And we forget to evaluate other parts of our lives. Like, what impact has this had on my relationship? What impact has this had on my overall well-being? Am I different? Do I have a different set of preferences? Do I care about different things? So, in the second category, become very inquisitive about who you are over a longer time frame and assume that it's not a static state when it comes to the first bucket, which is how do we develop a more complete and richer understanding of self? I think it's actually about surrounding yourself with a diverse set of people, people that you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards. I think this solves for a bunch of social ills, which is that, again, we tend to live in our silos, and we're really averse to talking to people who have different points of view. But I will tell you, at times I've learned the most about myself, I've learned the most about my weaknesses and sometimes my strengths from talking with someone that I vehemently disagree with. And it's a really hard thing to do. It's very painful. But in terms of edifying experiences go, it's through those conversations that I almost see this mirror reflected back on me. Like, wow, I'm much more aware of how I'm coming across to that person because they disagree with me about something or they're not someone I would normally fraternize with. And it's just bred more self-awareness in me. And so I would encourage people to actually seek out connections in uncomfortable spaces because that will allow you to fill in at least some of the gaps. Now, some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you because of life experiences. So, I'm thinking in my own life, I thought I grieved in a very particular kind of way. And then during COVID my husband and I experienced multiple pregnancy losses with our surrogate, and I found myself grieving in a way that was completely foreign to me. I don't think talking to anyone would have revealed to me that I was going to grieve in this way, where usually I would reach out to people and I would want to stay connected. And I became so shut off and closed off, and I didn't want to talk to anyone for days after the losses. I was so disoriented there. I learned, oh, actually, you can respond in a diverse set of ways to grief. You don't have a singular experience with grief, but I might have only learned that from the actual experience of confronting it. That said, I do think there's a lot of value in trying to fill in gaps in knowledge or self-awareness through these more quotidian conversations you have with people. Andrew Huberman: I love, love, love what you said about deliberately placing oneself into environments where we receive critical feedback from people that we view as quite disparate from us, at least in terms of our experience of them. It was the great Karl Deisseroth, another incredibly accomplished neuroscientist, happens to be a colleague of mine at Stanford who, he's a psychiatrist, and he said, you know, we think we know how other people feel, but we really have no idea how other people feel unless we ask them. In fact, most of the time we don't even really know how we feel. We're not very good at gauging our own emotions. So credit to Karl for making that statement. But with that said, I think getting a sense of how other people see us, and disagreement in particular, can be incredibly informative. Maya Shankar: I just want to say one other point on this, which is I think getting feedback from others almost gets a bad rap these days in society, because it's like you should only care about who you are inside, who you know yourself to be. And I'm like, dude, we are social creatures. It absolutely matters how I come off to others. I think that should be a huge part of my self-identity, should be how I impact others. And I think we should be shameless about integrating that into our understanding of self. If I feel like I'm an excellent person inside and I'm regularly wounding the people around me, that matters, that's relevant to how I see myself. And so I do worry sometimes with the current cultural climate that we're pushing ourselves so much towards the space of, like, all that matters is authenticity and being yourself. First of all, sometimes yourself isn't awesome. You might want to actually optimize or change some things about yourself to be better. I think that's a good thing. And then, second, it's okay to care what other people think. Usually they're great barometers of things that you might not be aware of in terms of the impact you're having. So I just want to be a lobbyist for caring what other people think, just for a moment. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I agree. This is one of the reasons why I say at the end of every episode that I do read all the comments on YouTube. Maya Shankar: Me too! Andrew Huberman: I think I was raised in a culture, an academic culture, where feedback on lectures, student feedback, was critical. I mean, it is important, I believe, to be a selective filter, because in the old days, we'll say, there was an opportunity to map the statements to the grade that the student received, you can no longer do this. So you would often see that some of the worst feedback was, "hated, unclear." Maya Shankar: Exactly. Andrew Huberman: And then you'd look at their grade, and you'd say, well, okay, this helps explain, and yet it was also important to understand where that could have represented some failings on my part. And a classroom is but one environment. I think the online environment is where this gets tricky because of the way that we all differ in our capacity to receive critical feedback. And sometimes the harshness of one form of feedback sends people feeling back on their heels or feeling even ego or emotionally injured in ways that they actually feel traumatic. And I think that's part of the problem, is that we don't really have a way to gauge, I mean, we know inappropriate when we see it, we know appropriate when we see it. But all the stuff in between, because it's on a continuum, really is where it gets tricky. I certainly think integrating the possibility that somebody might be right, what is it that they say in certain forms of personal developments, like, if somebody's coming at you with an argument about you, the best state of mind you could have is you might be right, because that lets you hold your ground a bit. It still maintains a boundary, but you're not saying you're right, and you're not saying you're wrong. You're in a kind of a flat-footed stance where you could move either way. And I like that. This idea of, well, they might be right, and then you could say no or yes. But in any case, I just want to throw up both hands and as many votes as I can, as one individual, to say yes, I totally agree. More direct feedback and disagreement is great. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: It's wonderful. And I think in science, you're used to people saying harsh things about your work until they eventually say, okay, you can publish the paper. [ Maya Shankar: LAUGHS] That is true. Andrew Huberman: I grew up in the culture of skateboarding, where nothing's good enough, and then occasionally something's good. And in the landscape of podcasting, I think the comment section is a great way to get feedback, and that's why I continue to encourage feedback. It sounds like you do as well. Maya Shankar: Yeah, I think, every endeavor that I pursue, I try to approach with a lot of humility. And I think if I were to describe, at work, right, I lead this team, and I think if you were to ask people what my defining trait is as a leader, it's actually not, like, strong convictions. It's actually a willingness to update her opinions on things, her belief systems, her strategy based on incoming information. I really, really pride myself on having a flexible mindset about stuff and not being stubborn. This is true in my marriage. Like, my husband Jimmy and I really pride ourselves, you know, saying, you know what? Based on what you just shared, I'm changing my mind. Like, you're right and I'm wrong. And if you can actually start to value that, if you could start to see that as a virtuous quality. I think historically, when we think about leadership, we've thought about people who are incredibly resolute in their convictions, but that doesn't allow the space to, again, beige an update. Update your mindset when you get new information or you realize that you erred in some way in terms of the logic that you used or what have you. And I've been extremely intentional in every sphere that I've worked in to have this very open mind and to be very open to critical feedback. It does not mean that I take every piece of feedback. Okay, obviously I have some criteria I use to decide whether it's meaningful feedback or it's not meaningful feedback. But the locus of my pride is not in being right or having the strong conviction. It is actually in my willingness to have a more dynamic state of mind regarding lots of issues. Maybe that's just what it means to be a scientist, right? Like, you have to be willing to update in the face of new information. Andrew Huberman: I am nodding, for those that are listening. I'm just nodding and thinking yes and more yes. Because I think that we all need more of that as individuals. And if we can't get it from our work setting or group setting, sometimes asking a friend can be extremely useful. I have a friend. He happens to be a professor at a university back east. I won't embarrass him by disclosing where he's at, but I recall as a junior faculty member because he knows me well. He's a few years behind me in our career trajectories. But asking him for an honest assessment, I asked for the most brutally honest assessment of me that he could give, and some of it stung. Some of it stung. He was relating some ways in which I show up as a friend and I'm super present. Then I have this tendency, I'm pretty introverted, I'll disappear for long periods of time. In college, they called me Dart because I'd show up at parties. I'd be there, and then I would disappear for like two weeks and just be in my books, say hi to people and just keep going sort of in and out of connection. I've worked hard to change that over the years. I think I have. But who knows? In any event, a friend who knows us well that you insist on, all right, don't give me any compliments. Just give me the harsh stuff, that can be very useful. Maya Shankar: And that reminds me of some research by Ethan Kross. So he looks at how we can tame our mental chatter. And if you don't have the friend available to you, there is a really easy distancing technique that you can use when you're in the throes of a problem where you are trying to actively reframe something or maybe see where your blind spots are. And that's by thinking about your problem from a third-person perspective versus a first-person perspective. So you play the role of someone who's giving advice to a friend in your head, but that friend is actually you, and it actually promotes some degree of objectivity and emotional distance from, again, that fuzzy, hazy set of feelings that you have around the emotion. You're trying to get rid of that piece so that you can bring a slightly more sober recommendation to the situation. So that can be really helpful. And then the other thing to do is, I think, when we're facing challenges, when we're going through a hard time, we do have an instinct to want to vent, right? Again, in this era of vulnerability and whatnot, we're told, like, yes, share everything that's on your mind. It can actually be counterproductive to vent. And the reason for that is that when you're venting about a hard situation that you're going through, or something that you're frustrated about with yourself, typically the person you've invited into the conversation, they're a nice, empathetic person. They want to make you feel better. And so what do they do? They offer emotional balm in the situation. They're like, oh my God, that does sound terrible, you were so wronged. I'm so sorry you went through that, instead of playing the role of what Ethan calls like a cognitive advisor, which is actively trying to challenge the narrative you're telling about your situation, actively trying to get you to question whether the way you're portraying the situation is accurate, and actively trying to get you to reframe aspects of the situation. And so when we think about venting, when it comes to, again, filling in those blind spots about ourselves, you might want to tell your friend at the outset, like, you even said, lay off the nice stuff. I just want to hear the hard stuff you want to tell your friend at the beginning. Look, I'm having this challenge with my colleague at work, where this guy at the gym is giving me a really tough time. I don't know what's going on. Here's the situation. Rather than trying to make me feel better about the situation, I want you to actively find holes, poke holes in the way that I'm thinking about this thing so that I can try and find some reframing strategies to see the situation from a different vantage point. So these are all called distancing techniques. Third person versus first person. And actually, there's some really interesting neuroscience research showing that when we view our problems in ourselves from a third-person perspective, neural activity in areas associated with hostility and aggression actually decrease. And so that can be really helpful when it comes to resolving interpersonal conflict or trying to see where you might have been wrong. Andrew Huberman: I love these examples because especially the one where one does it on their own, it truly doesn't require anything. Maya Shankar: You can be the introverted Andrew and still do this. You don't even have to go to the party and then ghost everyone. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well, back then, there were no cell phones, or smartphones, rather. But, yeah, it was a bit of ghosting. I can reset with small numbers of people that I'm close to, but I found at that time a need to go into an isolated space to do what I need to do to reset myself. But I realized there are certain forms of communication that are still required. Like, I'm alive. I still get this from my mother every once in a while. She's like, if you don't reach out, not only do I not know what's happening with you, but I also don't know if you're okay. And I'm thinking, I'm a grown man. Of course I'm fine. And then I, of course, use the worst possible response that any son or child could give, which is, listen, if something happened to me, someone like the police would contact you-- Maya Shankar: They'll let you know. [ LAUGHS] -- Andrew Huberman: or the hospital would contact you, which is not reassuring. So, kids everywhere, call your parents. Maya Shankar: I know. Just call your poor mother, Andrew. Just call her a bit more, come on. [LAUGHS ] Andrew Huberman: I know, I know. Well, still working on it. It is a work in progress. Venting. I'm so glad that you brought this up. I think that there are these buzzwords now, authenticity, I do think that there are certain forms of communication that can be injurious to people, and yet I think having some internal buffers to all that incoming stuff is important. I mean, you can't be online, and I think everyone is pretty much online these days, without having some policies for oneself and how you're going to deal with this stuff. How am I going to be a selective filter? I think knowing the ends of the continuum — like this is clearly benevolent, kind, discourse, this is clearly bad. I'm going to block this or get rid of it, but then within that middle range, having some rules and policies for how to filter it, either by time of day that you look at it or getting input. But considering it might be true, it might not be true what people are saying. Maya Shankar: And like you said, you were talking about memory and how we tend to overweight negative experiences. And I did find myself like, so I gave this speech and it was posted, and I was looking at the comments, and anytime I brain-coded a comment as positive, I just skipped right past it. I was literally just searching for the negative stuff. Andrew Huberman: As if the positive is generic and the negative is somehow genuine. Maya Shankar: Yes. And I had to make it mental, I had to make a mental note. Hey, it's okay to marinate in the messages that are saying that this really helped them in some way and they really enjoyed the thing. Again, for self-critical people, I think it takes an extra step to remind yourself to also read the good stuff and to allow that stuff to count, too. Andrew Huberman: Well, we did an episode on gratitude, and one of the big surprises that came to me in researching for that episode was that the best evidence for gratitude having positive effects on neural circuitry, neurochemistry, comes from when we receive gratitude as opposed to giving gratitude. This is what's often lost in the discussion about gratitude. So all the more incentive to give gratitude and to be aware of when it's coming your way and internalize it. There is a small category of people out there, I think, hopefully small, that so bask in positive feedback that it amplifies their narcissism. But it's clear that you are not one of those people. So zero minus one risk of that happening. I want to talk a little bit about goals as it relates to motivation, because you've done a lot of important work. And what I consider is organization of this, what would otherwise be a pretty complex space. What is more important to most people than being motivated and focused and excited, hopefully on endeavors that they enjoy and that inspire delight. But tell us about what can not just initiate, but what can sustain motivation, because we've talked about the dopamine system on this podcast many times before, but that's a pretty reductionist way to look at it. And you have a different perspective that I've really benefited from learning a bit about. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So when it comes to goals, I mean, it's first important to recognize that there's two parts of a goal. So there's the way that we define the goal, and then there's the way that we pursue the goal. And I think we tend to overlook the first category, how we define the goal, because oftentimes our goals seem like they should be so obvious to us, right? I want to lose weight. I want to avoid sleeping late so that I get a good night's sleep. I want to build muscle mass. Right? Like these are things that just seem like they should just be intuitive, right? But what research and behavioral science shows is that not all goal frames are made equal. In fact, really small tweaks to the way that we frame our goals can have an outsized impact on whether or not we're successful at reaching that goal. So one such framing is whether you frame your goals in terms of an approach orientation or an avoidance orientation. Let me talk about what this means. So an approach orientation would be, I want to eat healthier foods. Avoidance would be, I want to avoid unhealthy foods. So in the context of, say, your social life, approach would be, I want to be in a relationship, I want to enter a relationship. Avoidance would be, I want to avoid feeling loneliness. I want to avoid feeling isolated. Now the reason why these two frames are important to consider is that they can have a different impact on our motivational states, and they can also have a different impact on the emotional response that we have to success and failure in these domains. So what we tend to find is that when you frame something in an approach orientation way, when you succeed, that success is met with feelings of pride and accomplishment. We find that it leads to a boost in motivation, it boosts endurance, it boosts perseverance. When you frame something in terms of avoidance, success is met with feelings of calm and relief. So kind of like a wipe the forehead. Like, thank goodness I avoided that calamitous outcome. Or thank goodness I avoided doing that really bad thing. Andrew Huberman: Back to neutral? Maya Shankar: Yeah, exactly. And so it is fine to frame goals in terms of avoidance. And actually, sometimes it's just personality dependent. Like some people are more driven by fear or they need a lot more urgency to drive them. But it is important to know that the approach orientation is, on average, more motivating. And so you might want to think of reframing your goal in terms of approach versus avoidant. The other advantage to approach is that when you frame something as avoidant. I want to avoid doing X, I want to avoid doing Y. It's really hard to measure success. It's like, are you really tracking every time you're tempted by the chocolate chip cookie and you don't actually eat it? That's really hard to measure. And we do better when we can measure success and failure. It's much easier to track the number of times you approach a salad. You approach something that's healthy. And so, anyway, so it's really interesting to see how, again, this really subtle shift, and we see this across the board in behavioral science, can have such a big impact on behavior. And on this framing thing, I'll just share one little anecdote from my time working in government. So we were trying to motivate veterans to sign up for an employment and educational assistance program, so this is after their years of service. And this is a really important benefit that the government offers for free, because the transition from military to civilian life can be very fraught with a lot of psychological and physical obstacles. And so I remember the Department of Veterans Affairs, they had almost no money to fund a marketing program around this. They said, Maya and team, we've got one email that we're going to send to vets, and have at it. But that's all we're working with. And my teammates and I ended up changing just one word in this email message. Instead of telling vets that they were eligible for the program, we simply reminded them that they had earned it through their years of service. And that one word change led to a 9% increase in access to the benefit. And it's based on a psychological principle called the endowment effect, which says that we value things more when we own them, or in this case, have earned them. And so I shared this example only to say, like, that is such a small change, right? But we just know that, again, these small little tweaks in the way that we talk to ourselves, the way that we frame our goals, can have a really big impact on our behavior. Andrew Huberman: I'm fascinated by that result. Some people hearing it might think, okay, 9%, is that really that great? But we're talking about a one-word change. Maya Shankar: And the scale of the federal government. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Right. Big organizations. Hard to argue that things change quickly in big organizations. Discussion for another time. But eligible versus earned. I mean, again, I come back to this possibility that there's something about words like "earned" that invoke a verb state within us that makes us more action oriented, similar to being able to see ourselves in some landscape that can evoke delight or awe, as opposed to just seeing the landscape that evokes delight or awe. Yeah, I'm really hung up on this because I think one of the major challenges, it seems, for behavioral change is that most people do wait for the stick, as opposed to feeling into the carrot, so to speak. I mean, all you have to do is look at the enormous number of people who are struggling with health-related issues for which there's now a lot of active debate. Is it genetically determined? And setting all that aside, it's just very clear that there are a number of behavioral things, sunlight, sleep, exercise, social connection, nutrition among them, that there's no pill for, there's no injection for, there is absolutely no replacement for. So getting people to change their behavior is hard. Telling people that they're capable sometimes helps, but doesn't seem sufficient. So what are some more of these verb states that people you think can internalize that give them access to the real sense of possibility and get them changing their behavior? Maya Shankar: Yeah, and behavior change is very hard. I sometimes bristle at some of the hacks that I see online because I'm like, I don't think there's a lot of evidence that supports that this works, so, you know, what I'm sharing today is actually backed by really high-quality research. One of my friends and mentors, Ayelet Fishbach, has done a lot of this work at the University of Chicago on goal setting and motivation. A couple other things for people to consider, and by the way, I love this space because I'm obsessed with goals, so I love getting better at things, and I'm using all of these insights in my own life, so it is truly a delight to get to share them. Okay, sidebar. Andrew Huberman: Important sidebar, I would argue, because you live this stuff, right? You don't just research it, you live it. Maya Shankar: Yeah, it's totally " me-search," or whatever they call it. So who sets the goal matters. So a lot of us work with coaches, trainers, mentors, bosses. That's great. It's really, really helpful for people in our lives to bring structure to our goals, to push us along, to motivate us. But when other people are setting our goals, setting our targets for us, it undermines a really valuable source of motivation, which is being in the driver's seat. We love steering our lives. We love feeling agency. We love recruiting our own agency when it comes to achieving our goals. We talked about how people will go to irrational lengths to avoid feeling uncertainty. People will also go to irrational lengths to preserve their agency and control over a situation. So there's some really interesting research that's come out just in the last few years showing that humans prefer to use their judgment over an algorithm that they know performs better than their judgment, but did not involve them, and they're much more satisfied with the outcomes when it's them that's in the driver's seat. And so what this means, I think, in everyday context, is not to do away with, like, trainers and coaches and whatnot. Every trainer and coach who's listening, don't hate me. Okay? You're sticking around. But what they can do is they can build something of a choice set into your day-to-day programming. So let's say that at work you have a certain skill that you're trying to build. Ask for a set of options to choose from. Own the targets more, you will see a boost in motivation. Let's say you're working out with a trainer. They're like, it's leg day, okay, I'm going to own some of my targets, right? Are we going to go heavy, hard on deadlifts? Are we going to go hard on squats? Whatever it is. And so build some agency into the experience, because nothing supplants that kind of intrinsic drive and the feeling that you own the success or the failure. Again, I think to your earlier point, what we're really trying to do with some of these behavioral insights is capitalize on our natural state as humans, right? Like, what drives us. And it turns out we really love being in control. Well, why don't we monopolize on that when it comes to our goal pursuit, right? So we're trying to figure out those areas of psychology that we can leverage. Andrew Huberman: That's fantastic. The word agency is so key here, I think. And it explains that earlier result, the shock experiment. People having agency over their response to 100% of the time, at least it's giving them some sense of control and mitigating it. Whereas when it's random, 50/50, rather, when it's random, 50% of the trials, then even though the outcome is better on the whole, it's perceived somehow as a reduction in agency. There's something fundamental there, for sure. When I started my laboratory and there was an additional pressure to publish papers, this was before getting tenure, I used to ask students in postdocs when the paper would be ready, and then finally I stopped asking and just said, why don't you tell me when the deadline is? And not a single one failed. Or rather, I should put it in the positive light — every single time they succeeded in beating their estimate because they were in control of that endpoint. Maya Shankar: Love that. Andrew Huberman: So it was at times challenging for me, but they set a date. And also, by the way, if they need to extend that date outward, we did. That was their choice. They said they needed more time. The rule in science that I think applies a lot of places is, I always like the phrase "as fast as I carefully can." Because you don't want to rush. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: But that sense of agency, I like to think, translated to more joy for them. Certainly there was a lot of productivity from them, and they might be listening to this. And so they can put in the comments whether or not I'm telling the truth here . [ Maya Shankar: LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Most of them are professors now. Maya Shankar: Well, that probably means they succeeded. Andrew Huberman: They definitely succeeded. The question is whether or not I had anything to do with it. My advisors always said the best thing you could do is support your students in postdocs and then just get out of their way. Because the really good ones, you can't control them. You're just trying to not screw things up for them. Maya Shankar: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of intrinsic motivation there. Andrew Huberman: I'm curious about the difference between lone pursuits and group pursuits, because I know you understand a lot about groups, and I want to make sure that we talk about groupthink, although that has such a negative connotation, but the way that we tend to kind of revert to the mean when it comes to our thinking and our opinions and certainly our explanations of who's right and who's wrong when we are in a collection of like-minded people. This could also be phrased as, what are the dangers of being among like-minded people? And then we'll relate that back to motivation. But what are the dangers of being among like-minded people? Maya Shankar: Yeah, well, in the context of goals and motivation, it can be very, very helpful to be in the context of like-minded people. And the reason for that is we often don't see failure up close when it comes to people pursuing their goals, but if we are in the presence of people whose values we share, who have a similar commitment to doing something, and we see up close that they sometimes have those days where they fail, or we have the vulnerability to show when we've failed, that can actually increase our resolve that the goals that we're trying to achieve are actually possible. I think the danger of being in the like-minded spaces is around how it limits your frame of mind, so when it comes to the ideas that you have, when it comes to the convictions you have around your points of view, it can be very dangerous to only be in the echo chamber again, because I want to give people strategies to challenge their way of thinking without them having to socialize. For all the introverts out there, I have a lot of compassion. I have introverted tendencies. So I get it. One helpful thought experiment you can use when you feel like maybe you're spending a little bit too much time around people who are just reinforcing whatever viewpoints you have is to ask how your belief system and your ideas and your opinions of things might have been different had you been born during a different time period and in a different family or cultural landscape, and what happens when it comes to our viewpoints is that they become so tethered to our identities that we feel like if we were to jettison a certain belief or value, we would be jettisoning ourselves, and that feels way too threatening. It's way too destabilizing to engage in that. But the minute you imagine what it would have been like to have been born in a different family, with a different religious belief system, with a different value system, all of a sudden you transport your same self, right — I'm still Maya — into this new environment, and you start to see how nonprecious some of your beliefs are, right? Maybe they don't have the sacred quality that you thought that they did. And so you might be more open to changing your mind, more open and receptive to challenging your own points of view if you engage in that thought experiment. Andrew Huberman: I recall you discussing a description of people watching a game of sport that involved bad calls. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Controversial referee calls. Andrew Huberman: Controversial referee calls. Yeah. If you could share with us a little bit about that result, because I find it really interesting, especially the part where the experimenters can swap the identities of the teams in theory, and then, well, basically what people come to realize is that our perception of the outside world is strongly informed by the group that we see ourselves in, and often to our own detriment. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Yeah. So this is a study from the 1950s. And to your point, we tend to think, okay, we're human beings. We're really enlightened, we're making decisions, and we're engaging in judgments of things based on data and evidence and facts. And surely my visual system wouldn't lie to me. So whatever I perceive is going to be true and a veridical representation of the world and, like, not true. Okay, a lot of our beliefs, and these are strong beliefs. I mean, again, they're what we believe to be fact about the world, is informed by our group membership. So in this study, loyal fans of two opposing football teams watched these controversial plays, so, where the referee made a call, and they weren't quite certain if it was like, in or out, let's say. And depending on your loyalty to the team, to whatever sports team, whichever side you were on, you were much more likely to favor calls that were made on your team's, in your team's favor. And when you ask people coming out of a study like this, it's not like, yes, I knew I was biased, like, I knew that I was basing my judgment of these referee calls based on my affiliation and my love of Team X or Team Y, you wouldn't think that. You'd think you were an arbiter of truth in this situation. You're just recalling what your visual system saw. And I think that shows how powerful these social forces are, how powerful our group affiliations are, because it can truly change the way that you see stuff. Of course, it can then transform the way that you think about stuff. And so that, to me, is a powerful reminder that when we are in disagreement with someone else and we just try to bombard them with facts, I mean, you're a scientist, so if you're hearing someone say something and you're like, oh, that's not accurate, that's not true. Your instinct probably says, but have you heard about the 2017 study, the peer-reviewed journal article from PubMed? But when you recognize that, actually a large part of our belief system emerges from the groups that we identify with, I think there's an inspiring lesson that comes from this. So we shouldn't be too disheartened by the fact that this is true, but it helps round out our understanding of why it is that people believe the things they do. And as a result, we have more resources at hand to try to understand how we can change their minds. So, one of the guys that I interviewed on my podcast, his name is Daryl Davis. He's a Black jazz musician, and he was confronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klan at one of his performances, and it led, talk about a slight change of plans, I mean, he just went on a totally different life path and ended up convincing dozens of people to leave white supremacy groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. And when it comes to Daryl and his approach, well, one, he recruited people's agencies, so he never implied to them, oh, I'm trying to change your mind. He always says, like, I didn't convince them, Maya. They convinced themselves to change their mind. So he recruited their agency. But he also tried his absolute hardest to not question their fundamental and underlying humanity. So he tried to understand, why are you part of this group, this vile, vitriolic group? And some people would share, well, you know, it's a family tradition thing. My father was in the Klan. My grandfather's in the Klan. Look, none of this excuses being in a hate group, okay? But at least it gave Daryl an understanding of some of the factors that were pushing them towards the group so that he might offer that sense of community, that sense of belonging somewhere else, maybe outside of a hate group. But if he thought that he was actually just fighting over facts, over whether African Americans should be treated equal to everyone else, then he would have lost that argument, because he wasn't even fighting with the right currency. What was relevant? It was the first episode of A Slight Change of Plans we ever released and continues to be my favorite. Because what was so thrilling about this interview is that the strategies Daryl used to convince people to change their minds again of these deeply entrenched, horrific views were totally corroborated by the science of how we change people's minds. So he used a lot of really effective strategies, just intuitively, like, he's just a mastermind behavioral scientist just by virtue of who he is. But he showed genuine curiosity for why it is they believed what they did, which is, again, extremely hard. And I would not have had the equanimity to show genuine curiosity for why someone is in the Ku Klux Klan. But he showed that curiosity. He increased his question-to-statement ratio. So it's really important to ask people a lot of questions, and then he would ask people a really important question, which is, well, what, in theory, could change your mind? Like, what evidence would I have to give you in order to change your mind about X, Y or Z? And the reason that I love asking that question is that it presupposes that someone ought to be willing to change their mind in the face of new information. So this hearkens back to the conversation we were having earlier about the importance of having a malleable state of mind and being willing to update in the face of new info. Now, if the person in response says, literally nothing will change my mind, okay, well, then, you know it's not worth your time to have the disagreement with them. But if they give you a little bit and say, well, maybe I would change my mind on vaccines if you were to tell me X, Y or Z, maybe I would change my mind on immigration reform if you were to tell me this or that. Now you have an in, right? But you do need to get them into the state of mind where they think, yeah, I guess in theory, I could change my mind about this thing that I feel absolutely resolute about. Andrew Huberman: I've never worked in public policy, but I feel very strongly that where I see failures en masse of public health policy or educational policy, almost always there seems to be a failure of even interest in understanding what motivates the other side's position. And this actually gets me frustrated to the point of being motivated, where it's like people are saying, you're wrong, you're wrong. Know this, know that to the point of it's almost maddening. And far more seldom do we see people saying, okay, I'm in a third person myself, or I'm going to put myself in the other person's shoes and say, why might they feel that way? Why would this person be listening to this individual as opposed to this public health individual? And look, without taking any stance on this, because it's a much bigger conversation than we want to have right now, I could look at public health officials that just completely failed to understand the other side's position and vice versa. And that to me just says it's a communication failure. And I'll take this out of the COVID pandemic discussion as it's normally had and say that one thing that we know for sure is that in the 2020 to, really, 2022, but still 2023 landscape, there were so many mental health concerns. Everybody, regardless of where people were on the vaccine debate, mass debate, lockdown debate, regardless of any of that, everyone's stress level was elevated. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: And there were very, very few top-down from, at the level of government, discussions about how to maintain circadian rhythm and sleep health, how to maintain health in general in that landscape. And that, for me, was just really shocking. It was also one of the reasons why we launched the podcast, frankly, is that I really feel that the tools were needed by everybody and should be zero cost to everybody. But what was clear is there was so much pointing of fingers and name-calling and violence even, that no one was saying, like, why would people feel this way? Why would people trust these sources as opposed to these sources? And we can only conclude if we're good scientists that the landscape was ineffective, right? It was just ineffective. And it continues. I mean, if you have the desire to take a reduction in dopamine by going on Twitter and following this back and forth that continues today, it's pretty ugly. Still, none of it seems really solution oriented. There are a few people out there who are trying to make it solution oriented, but not really. And so I don't want to go into the dark aspects here. But it does seem like this willingness to take a look at why others might feel the opposite of how we feel is a very rare quality. And this gentleman, Daryl, what was his last name? Maya Shankar: Daryl Davis. Andrew Huberman: I think I've seen a number of things with him. He's obviously extraordinary, but we call him that because people like him are exceedingly rare. So what can we do to cultivate that kind of mindset? Because I'm not pointing fingers here, I mean, I think we all have this default tendency to gather evidence the way that we gather evidence, draw conclusions, and then stand our ground. And I think it's detrimental to everyone. Maya Shankar: So you're making me reflect on probably the greatest gift that being a cognitive scientist has given me in my life. Obviously, it's fed my curiosity, it's been a delight to study things and learn things, but the greatest gift it has given me is empathy towards people. It is the greatest driver of human empathy to learn how our minds work. And I don't know if there's a substitute for that. Partly that's why I started A Slight Change of Plans. We have story episodes where you hear from people like Daryl, but I interview scientists from all over the world about their areas of expertise. And I genuinely believe that the more we learn about how the mind works, the more we learn from my field of cognitive science about how we make decisions, how we develop our attitudes and beliefs about the world, how we come to be the people that we are, the more we can bridge these empathy gaps. And it's been profound for me. I mean, I feel so lucky to have been steeped in this literature for decades now. But my hope is to invite people into the conversation, because the more you learn about why people are the way they are, the more empathy you can extend. And the more, I'm not even saying you need to extend an olive branch, I'm not saying that you need to compromise your own belief system, but at least you see that there might be an entry point, a reason to have a discussion with this person who believes things that are completely different from you. And we talked about gratitude a bit. In this conversation, I feel immense gratitude that I have a posture of empathy as I move around in this world, because I have strong beliefs on things. I care a lot. I care about reducing human suffering. And then I meet someone who I think is pro a policy that promotes human suffering. And of course, the visceral human instinct is like, to hell with you and your viewpoint, this is horrible, this is intolerable. But because I have this cognitive science hat on. It allows me to walk around with a slightly different viewpoint, and I really feel that I'm a better person as a result of that. And I've heard from listeners of A Slight Change of Plans, when they listen to these science episodes, whether it's the science of loneliness, the science of empathy, the science of meditation — I try to bring this empathetic spin to understanding, again, neuroscience and psychology — they have found that they are kinder to others. And so that's probably the best feedback that I've ever received on the show, is like, people are like, I'm a nicer person to other people now, especially the ones I don't agree with. Andrew Huberman: And presumably to themselves as well. I know you've brought up the topic of empathy as a way to prevent burnout, right? And here we're not just talking about job burnout. We're talking about the burnout that is inherent to any long-term pursuit that's challenging — raising kids, being in a family. What is the great Ram Dass quote? "Think you're enlightened? Go spend a week with your parents, no matter how enlightened you are." I remind myself that I love my parents. I love my parents, but it's just a completely different frame shift. But also kind to oneself. I mean, I think there's starting to be some good neuroscience at the mechanistic level of empathy. Clearly, empathy is not the default state for most people. It's something that we need to cultivate as a practice and that we can cultivate as a practice along the lines of empathy. But also returning to a topic that we opened today's discussion with. We build these narratives about ourselves starting in adolescence, maybe even earlier and through our teen years, and we have various experiences. But I'm curious how we can continue to build narratives about ourselves and the role of narrative, the "I" statements, the "I am" statements, and whether or not you and we should all spend some time doing this. I mean, these days people exercise because we know it's good for us. I hope people get sunlight because they know it's great for them, that people perhaps have a meditation practice or a therapy practice or a journaling practice. But how is it that we can continue to evolve our narratives about self in a way that promotes some or all of the things that we've been talking about today? Maya Shankar: Yeah. So empathy is really interesting because I think we have a lot of misconceptions about it, and we have misconceptions about how empathetic we actually are. I would argue people are more empathetic than they think, and let me tell you why. So, this comes from research by my friend Jamil Zaki at Stanford. There're three distinct types of empathy a lot of people don't know about. So the first kind is emotional empathy, and this is the one that feels very intuitive to most of us. So it's this visceral reaction I have. You tell me that you've had a really hard time. My eyes start to well up. I can truly feel your pain, and I just feel what you feel, okay? And that typically is what people think of when they think of empathy, period. They overlook two other types of empathy. The second type is called cognitive empathy. This is the ability to accurately diagnose what it is that's causing you distress in this moment, and what it is that I could offer up to you to try to help ameliorate some of your suffering. The third kind is called empathic concern, or it's known as compassion as well, which is the actual desire to help, you desire to help another person. And what's so interesting about these three types of empathy is that they don't correlate within people. You can be really high on the emotional empathy scale, right? You can have tears streaming down your face as you hear about your friend's divorce, but you might be really bad at diagnosing what it is that's causing them distress. You might be really bad at actually offering up a solution to their problem. Or you might lack the will. Like, if you're sociopathic, you might just not have the will to help someone. And what's so interesting is that I think in our society, this relates back to identity and the labels we give ourselves. I think our society puts a huge premium on emotional empathy, and we discount people who don't have that visceral response, and we just immediately say, oh, they're not empathetic. And this happens from the time that we're really little, by the way, like the kid who's crying on the playground, comforting their friend, right? They're like, wow, that kid's got a ton of empathy. My older kid doesn't seem to really care about people, but they might excel in cognitive empathy. They might excel when it comes to empathic concern. So one of the things I was talking about with Jamil on A Slight Change of Plans, you know, maybe we ought to think about empathy languages in the same way we think about love languages. People have different ways of expressing their empathy, and we ought to value them equally. And that's been wonderful, because I think even in the past, I would have had a really hard situation, and I go to one of my friends, and they just seem like, a little bit more stoic. And I'm like, do you even give a shit? Why do you not care as much as I want you to care? It turns out they're fantastic at wanting to help me and understanding what's wrong with me. And I love the idea of giving a little more love to those second two buckets, because I think it'll allow us to better recruit more empathy from others and also to see ourselves differently, maybe for those people out there who are like, I'm not a very empathetic person. You might actually be more empathetic than you think. The second thing I wanted to share is about burnout. So you talked a little bit about burnout. People who rate really high on the emotional empathy scale tend to experience burnout at higher rates. So you can imagine healthcare workers, first responders, essentially what you're doing when you feel emotional empathy is you're carrying the burden of the other person's pain. So you can easily imagine how that can deplete you. And I think the instinct that we have when we're empathetic is to say, you know what? I'm just going to shut myself off. I had that experience in 2020. I was like, there's too much bad stuff happening around me. Like, I prefer to just not feel things. Thank you very much. And so I tried to close myself off from natural emotional reactions I would have to things. But what Jamil's research shows is that you don't actually have to. If you cultivate cognitive empathy and empathic concern, those can actually be protective against burnout. So you don't have to do away with empathy altogether. You just have to shift gears and be more selective about the kind of empathy that you're investing in. So I love this research because, again, it just opens your mind up to this whole world of empathy that you might have thought of as more as, like, the singular concept and allows there to be a little bit more gray space. Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that there are different categories of empathy. It will also arm me with a response if ever, hypothetically, someone says, I don't feel like you're really feeling what I'm feeling, and therefore you're not empathic. To my experience, where I rate on these scales isn't important. But this notion of cognitive empathy, I think, is really important and probably one that most people haven't heard of. I certainly haven't heard of it, but I like to think that it really does exist and that it's at least-- Maya Shankar: And you might have it in spades. Andrew Huberman: I don't know. You'd have to ask the people close to me. But that it is at least as important as the emotional empathy. Before we conclude there is something that I unfortunately pushed us past too quickly that I want to return to because I think it's something that so many people care about and live with each day, which is this issue of challenges with ongoing motivation. And forgive me for doing a bit of an anachronism here. I'm sort of jumping back to this because I realized that I pulled us off to another topic, but you've talked about the middle problem before and it's too important to not return to. So tell us about the middle problem and how we can overcome the middle problem. Maya Shankar: And before I do that, do you mind if I give just a couple short strategies around goal setting? I just want to make sure I round out that section. Andrew Huberman: Not only would I not mind, I would be delighted. Maya Shankar: I just want to make sure, again, I share the wisdom that's helped me so much in my personal life. Okay, I'll try to be fast. Andrew Huberman: Please take your time. Maya Shankar: But people have these goals to reach, I got to get them out running. So the first is to make sure that you are, so we've already talked about approach versus avoidant goals, right? We've talked about how who sets the goal matters and how if it's you, it's better. If you have some ownership over your targets. The third thing is to make sure that you're setting goals when you're in the same psychological and physiological state as the one you'll be in when you're actually pursuing the goal. Because we tend to have what are known as ... This is, again, fishbox work. We tend to have empathy gaps between our present day selves and our future selves. And that empathy gap can lead us to be very compassionate towards 4 p.m. on Sunday, watching-TV Maya, and 6 a.m. Maya, who I hope is going to be at the gym, like killing herself with a really high-intensity interval set or whatnot. And so if it is 4 p.m. on Sunday, probably not the best time for you to say, I'm going to go to the gym every day at 6 a.m. If you actually are at the gym at 6 a.m., and you are feeling viscerally the physiological pain, the psychological pain of having gotten up really early to do the workout, then it's reasonable for you to set that goal. But it's kind of the opposite of, like they say, don't go to the supermarket hungry. Actually, in this situation, you want to be in exactly the same physiological and psychological state you'll be in when you're in goal pursuit. It'll make it much more likely that you set reasonable goals and you actually reach them. The second thing that you might want to think about is, so I don't know about you, Andrew, but I feel like I'm a goal purist by nature. So when I set a goal, the minute I, like, fall off even slightly, the goal is gone for me, and I'm like, I messed up. Let's start from the beginning. Let's start from scratch. I need a new goal. I've already messed up, and it doesn't matter. So I feel like unless I achieve perfection in achieving my goals, I get very frustrated and I just fall off the wagon completely. So one thing that researchers have shown is that it's really helpful to build in what's called an emergency reserve into your goal setting, or slack is another way of putting it. So let's say I have a goal. I want to go to the gym every single day this month. It's really important and helpful to give yourself — and you're not going soft on yourself, I promise — to give yourself, for example, three get-out-of-jail-free cards, three days where, for whatever reason, it's okay that you didn't go to the gym, you got sick. Maybe you have kids who got sick. You're just not feeling motivated. It doesn't really matter what the reason is. You didn't go to the gym. But the important thing is that you're still on track to achieving your goal, even if you missed those three days, because you built them into the system. The final thing I'll say about setting the goal is to try to capitalize on a phenomenon known as the fresh start effect. So this is work by my friend Katy Milkman. She's a professor at Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania. So what she's found is that in our lives, we have these big milestone moments where we break from the past and we're entering a new future. This might be moving across the country. It could be getting a new job. It could be getting married. It could be whatever, okay? But one, it feels like a big change, and that's a wonderful moment to try to introduce a new set of patterns into your life, in part because, again, you have a break in identity. But two, it's really easy to introduce new habits when a lot of your environmental circumstances are different. So I take a new job. All of a sudden, I have a new route to work. Probably a good idea to not introduce a pastry stop every time I go to work, because I no longer am passing by that bakery every morning. So you want to capitalize on fresh starts of that kind. There's also more arbitrary fresh starts that exist for all of us, and this is in the form of the first day of the year. So, of course, New Year's resolutions, the first day of spring, even the first day of the week, can be very motivating because we all like clean slates. We like wiping away the past. We like embarking on a new future that's clean of failure and stumbling and whatnot. And so that can be a really powerful motivator. Andrew Huberman: I love these suggestions because I do think that we like a clean start. There's something to that. Who knows why? But I think it's a universal trait. And perhaps shortening the time domain over which we think about our goals and success and failure could help. Like if you just say the clean start is this afternoon, because this morning didn't go so well. Maya Shankar: Yeah, you don't have to surrender the whole week just because you messed up on a Monday morning. Andrew Huberman: That's right. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: I'm sensing the perfectionist in you. And I know that it's a continuum. Some people don't, I don't want to say suffer from perfectionism, because I think it's a great attribute in certain domains and can be challenging in others. But I love the idea of having a little bit of grace with one's goals. And also what you said earlier of making the carrot compelling and not so much focusing on just the stick, making the carrot more compelling, so much there. What about the middle problem? Yeah, because I do think that people do tend to go hard out the gate, as it were, and then people drop off. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So, yeah, all the stuff we talked about so far has been around defining the goal. And now we need to think about how we sustain our motivation to pursue the goal. And this can be super hard. Again, behavior change is incredibly hard to sustain. So the middle problem. So the middle problem refers to the fact that we don't have stable amounts of motivation over the course of goal pursuit. We tend to have a boost in motivation at the beginning of the pursuit. We all feel this viscerally, right? I've decided I'm going to do intermittent fasting, or I'm going to make sure I look at the sun every morning the first moment that I get up, or whatever the goal is on that first day, you are so motivated to get it done right. In fact, the first few days, the first few weeks, and then you experience a boost in motivation, a higher amount of motivation towards the end of the goal. So we experience at the end of a goal what's known as the goal gradient effect. So we tend to experience monotonic increases in motivation the closer we are to the finish line. So we might even see it in marathon runners, right? They're like, okay, I only have this remaining part to go. I can expend all my energy now to try to get over the finish line. There's a lull, though, in motivation in the middle of goal pursuit, and that's something that we want to get ahead of, we want to solve. For now, obviously, we cannot eliminate middles. Mathematically impossible to eliminate middles. So what do we do? Well, we do something that you already alluded to, which is actually we shorten the time duration of our goals. So rather than setting an annual goal, right, let's say that it's the New Year, you're inspired to try to make 2023 the best year ever. But the problem with that is when you set an annual goal, now your middle is months long, so you're going to experience that decrease in motivation for a healthy chunk of the year, which is not ideal. If you set a weekly goal, by contrast, all of a sudden, your middle is a lot shorter, right? All of a sudden you're dealing with like a few days, maybe a day or two. And so you want to be mindful of the duration of the goal. Another thing that can help keep motivation high is to do what my friend Katy Milkman calls temptation bundling. So this has, number one, been my go-to strategy for having done every unpleasant activity in my life that I've had to do, okay? Folding laundry, doing the dishes. I actually really like working out like you do, so I don't need as much motivation, but sometimes I still need that for high intensity days. I do need the motivation to do, like, the hard cardio. So to get on into working out in that way. So what is temptation bundling? You're pairing an unpleasant activity like folding laundry, doing dishes, taking out the trash, with an immediately rewarding, enjoyable activity that can be listening to your favorite podcasts, which are, of course, the Huberman Lab, and A Slight Change of Plans. Obviously, it could be listening to your favorite pop music, but the really critical piece of the temptation bundling is that you have to forgo the indulgence of enjoying that rewarding activity in all other spaces of your life. So, for example, for me, I feel like a good pop song. I have, like, 25 really good listens, and then it kind of becomes old hat. So just, like, the excitement of the song wears off a bit. So there have been times where I'll be, like, cooking with my husband, and he's like, hey, why don't we play, you love Kasey Musgraves, why don't we play that album? And I'm like, no, that's an album I can only listen to when I'm, like, lifting weights. Andrew Huberman: Maintain the potency. Maya Shankar: You have to maintain the potency, right? You don't allow yourself to get the joy and edification of the Huberman Lab when you're not taking a walk and getting exposure to that morning sunlight. And it's such a simple strategy when you think about it. But I have found myself looking forward to really annoying tasks that I have to get done because I know I'm going to get the enjoyment of something really fun that accompanies it. Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. Is it important that the thing that one enjoys be done simultaneously? So folding laundry while watching the Netflix thing or listening to a particular piece of music? Maya Shankar: Yeah, you want them to coexist, because then again, you get that immediately. Most of the time, the things that we lament doing have really positive long-term outcomes. If I'm in the habit of keeping my house clean, there's long-term benefits. If I'm in the habit of exercising or eating healthily, there's long-term benefits. But I don't often feel the rewards in real time. So what you're trying to do is give yourself that rush of joy and excitement that accompanies the immediately rewarding activity so that in your mind, even just, like neurally, the two things are coexisting. Andrew Huberman: I love it because it has such firm grounding in the neurobiology of reward and aversion and how to overcome aversion. There's deep neuroscience around this, but I've never heard it presented that way. So thank you for those incredibly clear and actionable tools for motivation, because so many people struggle with that. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: And I hear that all the time. Maya Shankar: And I think you talked about aversion. And actually, this is really important. So when we think about returning to our goals, which is often the hard thing. So you do it on a Monday, and you have that same goal on a Tuesday, and then on a Wednesday, and on Thursday, and by Thursday you're kind of like, oh, my God, it was so hard the first few days. Do I really want to go back and do the same workout on a Thursday? What's really helpful here to avoid some of that aversion is to be mindful of the way in which our minds process memories. So when we reflect back on how much we enjoyed or didn't enjoy an experience, we don't give equal weight to every moment. Each moment doesn't get uniform weight. Instead, we tend to give more weight to what's called the peak of the experience. So the experience that was most emotionally intense, the part of the experience that was the most emotionally intense, and the end of the experience. So this is work done by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator, Amos Tversky. So the peak end rule is what this is called. So you put a lot of weight on, again, that really emotionally intense moment of the experience and the end. Now, researchers have studied this in the context of lots of unpleasant activities. So in some studies, people are forced to submerge their hands in ice cold water, or they looked at colonoscopies, for example, and how unpleasant those are. And what they found is that this is so interesting. Okay, I'm nerding out a little bit because I just think that this field is so cool. Andrew Huberman: Nerding out isn't just tolerated. It is encouraged on this podcast, Maya Shankar: I'm having a moment with cognitive science. But this is such cool research, because what these researchers did, it's so clever. If you elongate the unpleasant experience by a couple of minutes, let's say, so, the hands in freezing cold ice water or the colonoscopy, but you make those last few minutes of the unpleasant experience slightly less unpleasant than the end of the experience would otherwise have been. Right, had you just ended the colonoscopy procedure as planned, had you just taken the hands right out of the ice bucket by, for example, increasing the temperature of the water by a degree, or use your imagination, whatever the equivalent. Andrew Huberman: How can you make a colonoscopy less? [ Maya Shankar: LAUGHS] There are mechanisms by which the pain can be less. [ Andrew Huberman: LAUGHS] Physicians everywhere know them, but we are oblivious to them. Maya Shankar: Anyway, you guys can do the mental work of figuring out what the equivalent is on Google. What they find is that people look back on the experience more favorably. They have a more positive impression of the experience. Now, again, this is what's so miraculous about this finding. The overall duration of the unpleasant experience has been extended. There are more minutes of overall suffering, right? But the last few minutes are less bad than they would have been otherwise. And so people are, they view the experience more favorably. In the case of the colonoscopies, they were actually more likely to return for follow-up visits, for their annual checkups. And so what does this mean in daily life? Well, what it can mean is, let's say you are literally killing yourself at the gym. You have the hardest workout that you've ever had. Tack on a few minutes to the end of the workout that are still unpleasant, so you're still coding them as being part of the unpleasant working out experience, but are a little bit less intense and less painful than the workout end would have been otherwise, you might be more likely to return and actually do the hard workout. Andrew Huberman: Can we also say if somebody really enjoys their training, that the opposite would be effective as well? That perhaps if they really want to push it hard at the end, because that's the sensation that they particularly enjoy, that that could serve, presumably, the memory systems and the reward systems of the brain such that they are more likely to return to the workout again. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. You raise a fantastic point, which is when we talk about enjoyment in these contexts, it is all subjective. So I actually kind of love the feeling like, I'm going to die, because my heart is racing. So, I mean, for whatever reason, I'm just wired to love exercise, right. And I love a heart strength-training workout. And so for me, what enjoyment might look like at the end is really intense. Right. That might be what brings me back. But in other domains, absolutely not, like the colonoscopy situation. I do not want that to be an unpleasant experience. And so there are lots of other domains in life where if you just tack on a few of the few minutes onto something that's really tedious or really hard or really painful, it can make you more likely to commit to it later. But it's an excellent point. In all of these studies, you have to consider who the person is and what their natural psychology is like. And for everyone listening, you want to tailor these recommendations to who you are as a person. Andrew Huberman: Well, there are certain life demands that I find incredibly aversive, so I'm going to use this approach for those. I'm also going to use them in the context of things I really enjoy. Because if one has the opportunity, I believe, to further reinforce the things that bring us joy, why wouldn't we? Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: Fantastic recommendations. Listen, I could ask you 1,000 more questions, and my hope is that you'll come back-- Maya Shankar: I'd love to-- -- Andrew Huberman: so that I can ask you those 1,000 plus more questions. I have to say, it is exceedingly rare that I talk to somebody either on the podcast or elsewhere, frankly, in my life, that has such an incredibly wide breadth of knowledge and yet has so much depth of knowledge as well. It's clear that your many experiences through music and cognitive science, podcasting, and by the way, we're going to provide links to your podcast in the show note captions so that people can hear more from you, as they should, and also your work in policy. You've put yourself in a lot of different domains, and I think that itself is inspiring. And whether or not it's by way of curiosity, human connection, or both, presumably it's both and many other things as well. I know I speak on behalf of many, many people. I just say thank you so much for doing the work that you do, for continuing along these pursuits. I'm excited to hear where it might evolve in the future still, and frankly, just for being you, because it's clear that your enthusiasm, your curiosity, and your generosity with useful information is immense. So thank you ever so much. Maya Shankar: Well, that's so gracious and kind of you to say, Andrew. And these conversations, like the one we just had, I mean, it's why I do the work. It's so much fun and so interesting, and you've given me so much food for thought. It really was a conversation, not an interview, and that's such a gift. And so I just feel gratitude that I can share my body of work and all the insights I've learned along the way with your listeners, and I really hope it's helpful to them. Andrew Huberman: It certainly is, and it's been an honor to have you here. So let's do it again. Maya Shankar: Yes, let's do it again. Thanks so much. Andrew Huberman: Thank you.

Title: How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset
Published: 2023-07-17 12:00:02 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we're discussing growth mindset growth mindset is one of the most interesting and Powerful Concepts in all of psychology growth mindset is essentially a way of embracing Challenge and thinking about your bodily and brain's response to challenge in a way that allows you to optimize your performance growth mindset consists of many things which we will discuss today and of course we will discuss how to implement growth mindset but some of the key features of growth mindset are developing an ability to distance your identity from The Challenge you happen to be embracing now that might come as a bit of a surprise to many of you for instance we grow up hearing we hope from time to time that we are smart that we are talented that we are a good athlete that we are a good artist you know we like to think that we are good at something or perhaps many things but it turns out that the kind of Praise or feedback that we receive that attaches our identity to Performance can actually undermine our performance and believe it or not this is especially problematic for people that perform well in their Endeavors that's right if you are somebody who performs well in school or Athletics or music and you are told that you are very smart that you're an excellent student that you're an excellent athlete or that you're an excellent musician you have much to lose if you at any moment do not perform well and that's because your identity has been integrated with your performance somewhat counter-intuitively growth mindset is the process of distancing your identity from performance and rather attaching your identity and your efforts and your sense of motivation to effort itself and to the process of enjoying learning and getting better at learning anything so today we are going to discuss what growth mindset is and what it isn't because it's often discussed in terms that frankly are not accurate to the science we will also talk about another mindset which is the stress is enhancing mindset that it turns out can act synergistically with growth mindset such that when you combine growth mindset with the stresses enhancing mindset you and anyone it's been shown can vastly improve your performance in essentially anything so today's discussion will of course explore the classic work of Carol dweck who was really the founder of the growth mindset field as well as some of the newer research from people like David Yeager Ali Crum and others who have explored how growth mindset and stress as enhancing mindsets can be applied both in and out of the classroom in children and adults and really in people of all backgrounds by the end of today's episode you will have a rich understanding of the science as well as many tools that you can apply in everyday life in essentially any Endeavor before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity there's absolutely no question that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're sleeping well and we're sleeping long enough everything in our daily life goes that much better now a key component to getting a great night's sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your core body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees con conversely in order to wake up feeling refreshed your core body temperature has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep mattress covers you can cool or heat your mattress at the beginning middle and end of your night in order to optimize your night's sleep I started sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover about two years ago and it has dramatically improved the sleep that I get each and every night if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to eightsleep.com huberman and save up to 150 off their pod 3 cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eightsleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Roca Rocco makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roca understands all of those challenges at the level of the eye and the visual system within the brain and they've designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that no matter what environment you're in you can always see with Crystal Clarity originally their glasses were designed for sports and as a consequence all of their glasses are extremely lightweight and as well they won't slip off your face even if you get sweaty however despite being designed initially for performance Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses include a lot of different styles that are designed for you to wear to work or out to dinner as well as the what I call the cyborg style they're designed for cycling Etc if you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses go to Roka that's roka.com and enter the code huberman to save 20 off your first order again that's Roca roka.com and enter the code huberman at checkout let's talk about growth mindset growth mindset as the name suggests is the idea that we can get better at things that is that our abilities are not fixed but rather that our abilities are malleable and at the core of growth mindset is the idea that our brains can change and indeed they can we refer to that ability as neuroplasticity or the the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience now I've done several episodes about neuroplasticity so that's a topic unto itself but suffice to say that neuroplasticity Brain Change can occur throughout the entire lifespan it is far more robust early in life from birth until about age 25 neuroplasticity is sort of the default process our brain is being shaped by our everyday experiences but certainly from age 25 and onward and certainly well into people's 90s even it's been shown the brain can change if we want it to it can change for the worse of course through injury or disease things of that sort but it also can change for the better through deliberate focused bouts of learning we can learn new languages we can learn art we can learn music we can get smarter we can get better at essentially anything if we devote our attentional resources to learning those things so really any discussion about growth mindset has as a subtext a discussion about neural elasticity although today we aren't going to focus so much on neuroplasticity meaning we aren't going to focus so much on the neural circuit and neurochemical changes that underlie neuroplasticity because I've covered those on previous episodes we'll talk about them a little bit today but we are mainly going to talk about the data the studies from the field of psychology applying growth mindset in and out of the classroom in children and adults and we are going to talk about tools everyday tools that you can use to enhance growth mindset for yourself and perhaps for those around you if you care to teach growth mindset which is you'll learn later turns out to be an excellent way to reinforce your own growth mindset and we're going to talk about how to apply those tools in a bunch of different domains musical athletic intellectual and on and on no discussion of growth mindset would be complete without mentioning that growth mindset is the brainchild of my colleague Carol dweck in the department of psychology at Stanford University today you'll learn how she discovered growth mindset and you will learn how others have taken that Discovery and expanded upon it and especially its application in and out of the classroom to start off our discussion about growth mindset however we need to Define what a mindset is I think most of us think we know what a mindset is we think oh it's kind of a a mental stance where you know we are positive or we are negative or we believe something or we don't believe something but a mindset actually has a very specific definition and here I'm referring to the definition provided by Dr Ali Crum Ali Crum is also a professor of psychology at Stanford she runs her own laboratory working on stress-related mindsets and other mindsets she's actually been a guest on this podcast previously highly recommend you listen to that episode if you haven't already Dr Crum defines a mindset as quote a mental frame or lens that selectively organizes and encodes information and I think the key thing to highlight there is organizes information because as you all well know we are constantly being bombarded with information from the outside world sensory information about what's going on with our visual system what we're hearing what we're seeing what we're feeling we are also bombarded with internal sensations of how full or empty our gut feels are we hungry are we tired are we anxious are we calm Etc so tons and tons of information funneling into our brain and mindsets really help us organize that information such that we pay attention to certain things and not others and we respond to certain things and not others okay so here I'm not trying to put additional language on something simple in order to make it complex I'm trying to put a little bit of language that is that a mindset does many things but it mainly organizes information I'll add to that for specific actions or inactions in a way that allows us to simplify our world in a way that allows us to make certain choices and do away with thinking about and acting on other types of information the other thing about mindsets is that they include entire narratives and most of the time we aren't even aware of how those narratives are operating meaning we don't walk around looking at opportunities in the world like the opportunity to get better at Fitness or a sport or music or arithmetic or languages or anything for that matter thinking okay what is my mental frame or lens that selectively organizes and encodes information we don't do that instead what we have are stories and those stories are usually attached to our sense of identity like I'll just use myself for instance I do not think of myself as a good musician in fact I can't read music I'm terrible at playing instruments I like listening to music but I consider myself a terrible musician right I've really assigned a value or I've assigned my value to music and my relationship to music right we tend to do that we can also do it in the opposite direction right I'm running a laboratory for a long time been in science for you know close to three decades so if you ask me you know do I feel proficient at science I'd say yeah I'm proficient at science I know how to do experiment setup experiments write research papers write grants Etc I'm pretty good at it right we tend to decide if we are good or bad at things and we tend to integrate those with our identity somewhat or a lot to depending on whether or not you know we're a professional or amateur how much we engage in an activity the point being that mindsets include all of these narratives and often those narratives are visible to us if we think about them but most of the time we are moving through the world meaning school work relationships and all our endeavors without a lot of careful thought about the narratives we carry and the beauty of growth mindset is that it forces us to step back and ask ourselves some simple questions these are questions that you could ask yourself right now and in fact I highly recommend you do you could ask yourself for instance what have I been told I'm really good at you should also ask yourself what have I been told I'm really poor at that I'm just not good at what have I told myself I'm really good at and what have I told myself I'm really bad at and then a second set of questions is what am I good at and why did it come naturally to me did I apply myself for many years meaning did I apply a lot of effort to learning that thing or perhaps both right and then it's also important to ask yourself why am I not good at other things is it simply because you've never applied yourself with those things or is it because you tried and had an early failure or perhaps you tried and tried and tried for many years and you continue to fail at that thing or you just didn't reach a level of proficiency that made you want to pursue it further in asking yourselves those questions you are asking yourself not just what you're good at and bad at and why you should also be thinking about where the messages of being good at something or being bad at something arrived from did they arrive from outside you meaning from your parents from your coaches from your teachers or was it the case that despite a lot of positive feedback you just sort of decided you weren't good at something or conversely was it the case that despite a lot of negative feedback that you would never be good at something or that you weren't good at something that you continue to persist because there are certainly people like that the more negative feedback they get the more they dig their heels in to prove themselves as capable of becoming good at something so I do recommend as we March forward in this conversation you think about those questions what am I good at what am I bad at why am I good at those things why am I bad at those things and ask yourself to what extent your labels that is your identity is attached to the things that you are good at or bad at and the reason I'd like you to ask yourself those questions is that next we're going to talk about some research from Dr Carol dweck's laboratory that was really the seed of the entire field of growth mindset it relates to a specific set of experiments that really show that the specific feedback we get meaning whether or not we get feedback that is attached to our identity like a label like smart or great athlete or talented sends us down a very different path of performance in the short and long run as compared to whether or not we receive feedback that's based on effort meaning you tried really hard or you really seem to apply yourself under conditions where you're getting the right answer over time because you simply refuse to quit those are two very Divergent sets of feedback and as you'll learn in a moment the sorts of feedback that we get especially early in life or early in an Endeavor so this doesn't just apply to young kids this applies to adults too who are taking on a new skill or trying to expand on an existing skill those two Divergent forms of feedback get integrated into our core beliefs about what we think is possible for us in a given Endeavor and the great news is we can also modify those core beliefs simply by changing the feedback that we give ourselves the research paper I'd like to discuss briefly that beautifully embodies the runway that led to the discovery of growth mindset is paper from Dr Carol dweck as well as her colleague Claudia Mueller and the title of the paper essentially says it all the title is praise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance right that should be surprising that praise for intelligence can undermine motivation and performance I would have thought and I think many people probably believe that if you tell a child or an adult that they're really good at something and you're genuine about that feedback meaning they're performing well and you say great you're doing really well you're so smart you're so talented that their performance would continue to improve that it would bolster their motivation to engage in that activity which hopefully they enjoy but regardless provided that it's a safe activity it's educational or what have you that it would serve to encourage them right the kid thinks not only am I engaging in this activity but I'm getting positive feedback presumably from people that I care about or whose opinion I care about wouldn't that serve to elevate performance it does not in fact the exact opposite happens so I'll just give you a few of the key takeaways from this study the way it was done is very interesting they essentially gave feedback about performance that was linked up with a child's intelligence telling kid they're smart they're talented that they can learn things really easily or that they're very good at learning this sort of thing and they call that intelligence feedback or they gave them what was called effort feedback the simple way to think about effort feedback is that it's more attached to verbs as opposed to labels so effort feedback consists of things like you tried really hard on that problem it was great the way that you applied effort it was great the way that you persisted it was great the way that even when you got the wrong answer you spent 10 minutes thinking about it and then you tried again and again or in some cases even if they didn't get the right answer telling them well even though you didn't get the right answer it's really terrific that you continue to try Okay so intelligence feedback was the sort of feedback that was tied to labels of identity things like smart talented Etc whereas effort feedback was tied to verbs choices behavioral and cognitive choices that children made in an effort to learn or get better at something so in this study which included over 100 children they either got the intelligence type feedback or the effort type feedback or there was a control group that didn't get either the intelligence or the effort type feedback and then they looked at a number of different outcomes so I'll just highlight a few examples of what they found first of all the kids that got the intelligence-based feedback when they were then later offered problem sets that were either challenging or were of the sort that they knew they could perform well on they tended to select problems that they knew they could perform well on these are what were referred to as performance goals in other words they picked problems that allowed them to continue to get the praise that they had received previously about being smart or talented whereas the kids that got feedback about their strong effort when later presented with problems that were either easy or hard more often than not they picked the harder problems that stood to teach them more so that's striking it says that if you tell a kid that they're smart or talented and that's the reason why they perform well when they encounter challenges they are likely to go with the least amount of challenge so that they can continue to receive that praise or feedback whereas if you receive praise and feedback for your strong effort then later you tend to pick environments problem sets Etc that allow you to exert the very effort that got you the praise in the first place so in both cases these children are essentially attached to the praise right in some sense I mean we like to think that they enjoy these activities and they're benefiting from them as well but in both cases the praise really serves to reinforce a certain pattern of behavior but in the case of giving intelligence feedback the kids are really just trying to reinforce being told that they're smarter talented as opposed to reinforcing the engagement in the activity that got them the praise in the first place and the converse is also true when kids are told hey you really tried hard and that's great or I like how you persisted or you're so persistent I can really see how persistent you are in trying to get the right answer even if you don't get the right answer well then when you present those kids with additional challenges they work very hard to stay in Challenge and guess what no surprise the kids that are rewarded for effort and that continue to pick harder problems outperform the kids that are given the intelligence praise and feedback by a large margin so what does this tell us this tells us that the narratives that we hear from others of course reinforce certain patterns of behavior what else does this tell us this tells us that if you're a parent or teacher you have to be very careful about giving feedback to a child that is attached to their identity around an endeavor especially if they're performing well at that endeavor right now of course if a child is not performing well at something you also don't want to tell them that they're stupid right you don't want to tell them that they're deficient right but that's a rare occurrence in the classroom one would hope that's a rare occurrence on the field one would hope but what's very common very very common is that when we see children or adults performing well we tend to give them identity labels as a way to try and reinforce whatever Behavior we observe and we like now the other thing they looked at in the study besides whether or not these kids would pick hard or easier challenges down the line where the actual raw performance on cognitive problems and these data I must say are just so interesting they took the kids and they gave them all the same problem sets and all the kids across the board whether or not they were getting intelligence praise or effort praise or they were in the control group we're performing more or less the same way they were getting some of these questions right some of these questions wrong then they gave them praise after they completed those problems they either got intelligence praise you're so smart you're so talented or they got effort praise you tried so hard you really persisted that's fantastic then later they gave them another set of problems and they looked at performance now remember the first time around all the kids got some of the questions right and some of the questions wrong so there's room for improvement for everybody what they found was absolutely striking the kids that were in the control group so they didn't get any specific form of Praise they perform more or less the same way as they did before so if they were getting 75 percent of the answers right the first time they got 75 percent of the answers right the second time 25 wrong in both cases the kids that were in the intelligence praise group that you're so smart you're so talented praise group their performance went down significantly whereas the kids that were in the effort praise group their performance increased significantly okay so this is a bi-directional effect where giving intelligence praise reduces performance and giving effort praise improves performance which is absolutely striking and tells you everything you need to know which is if you're a parent you're a teacher and of course as we all give ourselves feedback rewarding yourself for effort is the best way to improve performance rewarding yourself based on identity labels so smart so talented you're a great athlete Etc all that stare in the mirror and do self-affirmation stuff can actually undermine performance and in fact it does undermine performance it may not do it right away but eventually it does and in a moment I'll explain why the other thing this study looked at that I just have to mention is this notion of persistence so remember earlier I said that the kids that got intelligence praise tended to pick easier problems down the line whereas the kids that got effort praise tended to pick harder problems it turns out that the kids that got intelligence praise also tended to take on fewer problems overall they tended to limit the total number of challenges that they engaged in whereas the kids that got the effort praise that you worked so hard you're so determined that was so impressive how you just kept going even when you got some answers wrong those kids not only opted for harder challenges they not only performed better but they also took on many more challenges so these data really made clear that the effort praise is the way to go now I know many people have heard this whole thing about don't reward the person reward the effort reward the verbs as I'm referring to it but it's actually pretty rare that we hear effort rewarded in everyday settings and it is very common for us to overhear intelligence praise or Talent praise you know a kid comes home with a trophy and we tell them you're a great athlete right a kid comes home with a great report card you know you're so smart congratulations a kid comes home with some sort of win in their world and we tend to give them a label because we like to think that that label will get internalized and they'll start to view themselves as a winner we tell them you can do anything you're a winner you're a winner and of course you don't want to tell children or yourself or any other adult you're a loser right we do not want to do that you don't want to undermine performance that way but it's very clear based on This research and a lot of other papers similar to it that we all have a giant blind spot sitting in our psychological field when we are getting and receiving praise that really it is the sort of praise that's attached to the very efforts that led to the results that will lead to even improved results over time okay so this paper is really truly important it's a landmark paper in the field of psychology motivation learning and performance and that's why I'm discussing it in such detail here but it actually includes one additional piece of information that I also think everyone should know about and that is the tendency for children who get intelligence praise to misrepresent their performance on subsequent efforts what do I mean by that basically what I'm saying is in this paper they had the children perform on a given task and then they either got intelligence praise you're so smart you're so talented or effort praise you worked so hard you're so diligent you kept going even when you were faced with results you didn't like and then they had them do a series of other tasks and then report their results to other kids and what they found is that children who get intelligence praise when they need to report their scores either by walking up to the board and putting a little Mark where their particular score is or telling another student what their score was or even writing it down on a piece of paper covertly so that's not visibly being compared to all the other scores the kids that got intelligence praise tend to lie about their score and as you could imagine they tend to lie in the direction of making themselves appear as having performed better than they actually did so this is a pretty Sinister aspect of intelligence praise that we don't often hear about even if you've heard telling a person that they are smart or talented can ultimately undermine performance rarely if ever do we hear that telling someone that they're smart or talented can increase the probability that that person is going to misrepresent their performance in the future and that's true regardless of whether or not they perform pretty well or not in the past I mean you could imagine that the kids that were told that they were intelligent that they're talented that those kids you know if they were doing well and then suddenly did poorly that they Slide the score up a little bit we don't want anyone to do that but you can imagine how a young kid might do that to kind of preserve their ego but no in some cases these kids are already performing pretty well they're not getting 100 but they're performing in the top bracket and yet if they received intelligence praise they're still more likely to lie about their performance increasing it further still whereas the kids that receive the effort praise do no such thing they Faithfully represent their performance and as I mentioned before for many reasons that we'll talk about in a few minutes meaning the mechanisms and what's really going on in the heads of these kids that get effort praise they're performing better than everybody else so just to illustrate how important the findings in the study really are the paper was Paul published in 1998 but just two years prior in 1996 there was a survey of parents asking to what extent do you believe that intelligence is fixed and 85 percent answered that they thought that intelligence was fixed that means they believe that the brain was sort of a vessel of fixed size that of course when we're born into the world it's kind of empty we don't have any knowledge but that the job of schooling was to teach kids things and reveal an intelligence capacity that was innate and that couldn't be increased upon whereas nowadays we really understand mainly through our deeper understanding of neuroplasticity and how the brain learns that indeed the brain can learn and that intelligence is not fixed however in 1998 when these studies were done most people were of the core belief that intelligence is fixed that it cannot be improved upon and these results really drive home the fact that the type of feedback we get about our performance even when our performance is good can undermine our future performance or if we receive feedback of the effort praise type the you tried so hard you're so persistent type that our abilities can indeed improve and when you look at any intelligence test if you look at standard IQ test or you you know go way out onto the other end of the Continuum in terms of intelligence testing you look at emotional intelligence it is very clear that anyone and everyone can improve their scores on those exams and in fact can improve the various aspects of intelligence because in fact there are many different forms of intelligence through dedicated effort so this paper was really ahead of its time and it's really what seeded the entire field of growth mindset and the understanding of what that is so now I'd like to shift our attention to not just how getting one form of Praise or another form of Praise can diminish or enhance performance but really to ask why that would be how that is because in that understanding there's a very simple set of tools of narratives that you can tell yourself or that you can tell a child as they are attempting to learn that can greatly enhance your or their ability to learn before we go any further however I know many of you are listening to this with an eye toward the tools meaning you want to know what the tools are that you can Implement well earlier I had you ask some questions what are you good at what have you been told you're good at and how did you arrive at being good at those things I also encourage you to think about what you've been told you're bad at or less good at and what you tell yourself you're bad at and less good at and how you arrived at that conclusion right now I'd like you to ask yourself what is your typical narrative when you are engaging in things that you believe you are good at and what is your typical narrative meaning your internal dialogue in your head when you're engaging in things that you are not good at or if you're not engaging in those things when you think about engaging in those things and the tool that's very effective to apply even just in your own mind is to start shifting your narrative from those performance narratives of being really good at something or bad at something which are In fairness are the labels I'm using here but that's for sake of discussion and Clarity and to start to shift those narratives towards effort related narratives so I'll use myself as an example I'm pretty good at learning and remembering things cognitive information I'm pretty terrible at playing music in fact I'm downright terrible if I were to step back from those two statements I could take an intelligence type praise narrative and tell myself okay I'm um I have a great memory right that's that's a intelligence praise type narrative or I could tell myself the truth which is I tend to spend a lot of time with information in different forms I listen to it I read it I write it down I highlight it I put it up on a whiteboard I tell myself that information again in my head I think about it in different contexts I tell other people about it that's how I developed a good memory for certain types of information and that's still how I continue to build my memory and my information Bank in my head to this day it's not because I have a quote unquote great memory it's because I engage in certain verb processes to build up that memory okay I can also take a look at the let's call it the negative statement I am abysmal at music which frankly is a fair statement and I could say okay I'm just a terrible musician I have no musical sense I have no musical ability those are labels of the intelligence type labels or I could look at the verbs this is also true I have never really spent a lot of time trying to learn an instrument I failed early on at least in my mind I failed to get the results I wanted and so I stopped playing I made the dog next door Howell which by the way I did so I stopped playing I ceased the effort process and so in looking at it through that lens yes I'm a terrible musician but I'm a terrible musician as a consequence of having never really engaged in the types of behaviors and effort over time that would have allowed me to be anything but a terrible musician now I'm not asking you to do this exercise simply as a way to Puff yourself up about the things you're good at and reward yourself for all the effort that went into it nor am I asking you to look at the things that you're not good at and trying to take away some of the shame and blame although that would be a good thing as well that led to the fact that you're not good at these things the reason I'm requesting that you ask those questions of yourself is that they can start to give you a sense of the actual tools and how those tools are implemented in order to get better at the things that you want to get better at and and this is a very important and to not set yourself up for getting worse at the things that you already think you're good at because as we'll soon talk about when we attach performance labels to things that we are really good at we internalize that sense of self oh I'm good at this particular thing in my case if I gave a performance label or an intelligence label it would be of the sort okay I have a great memory but what happens when someone gives themselves or hears a performance or intelligence label around something that they're good at and then has an error or has a period where they're not that good at something well if you internalized a sense of identity around performing well at that thing and then at some point you don't perform well you will also attach your identity to that diminished performance whereas if you attach effort verbs to why you got good at something as well as why you are not good at something well then there's only room for improvement why do I say that well when we're talking about effort we're talking about verbs that is inherent to you if you did it in one context you can do it in another whereas ability and performance it's not the case that if you have a good memory You Are by default a good musician that might be the case but in my case certainly it's not the point being that when you think about the effort processes that you've engaged before and over and over again that allows you to continue to get better in a given domain even when or perhaps we should say especially when you stop getting the results you want or you start getting poor results and that effort process of practicing a lot many repetitions analyzing why you didn't get something right that can be engaged in a lot of different Endeavors across domains as we say so when we talk about verbs like effort or persistence or practicing a lot or analyzing errors and why you did something incorrectly and then getting back to the drawing board as it's called when you start to think about your successes and your failures through those lenses through the lens of verbs then you're really talking about something that's Central to who you are it's how you're wired it's Machinery that exists in your brain and nervous system and body that you can engage that time and anytime as many of you know I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012. so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast eg1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs now of course I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals

supply of vitamin D3 K2 okay so I've been talking about cognitive or psychological processes and the basic take home is that labels of intelligence labels of identity undermine performance and a striking aspect of that by the way which I failed to mention earlier but I should have is that if we receive those labels of being a high performer smart talented Etc either before or after a given task or game or exam it still has a detrimental effect in both cases meaning you tell someone heading into something you're a great athlete you are so smart you're going to do so well on this exam you undermine their performance or if they take the exam and afterwards before you see their scores or even after they score let's say they get an A plus they get everything perfect and you say you are so smart you are so talented you are undermining the performance on the next exam that's how striking these results are and again they've been shown again and again in different populations of students and adults conversely it's striking how powerful the effort labels can be at improving performance conversely and fortunately the same is true for effort-based praise so if before a kid or adult heads into a competition or exam or preparation for a competition and exam you say you know what I know you to be a really dedicated worker you really persist you know how to do hard things you really dig your heels when it gets hard and you overcome challenges if you do that before that child or adult heads into challenge they will perform better and if after an exam or performance or practice whatever the effort happens to be you tell them you really worked hard I love the way that even when you know you got kicked in the shin and you're limping along there and you're hurt you continue to play or even when you know everyone else went to sleep and you continue to study although by the way I do encourage people to get enough sleep there are times in which let's face it the person who stays up latest studying provides they get enough sleep they're getting the extra hours in right I might have been that kid in college or tried to be that kid in college if you reward effort after the effort you also set the mind the brain of that child or adult up to provide more effort to future endeavors so it's very clear it doesn't matter if the timing of the praise comes before or after a given bout of effort or performance you give identity praise before performance diminishes you give identity praise after subsequent performance diminishes you give effort praise before performance goes up you give effort praise after performance goes up so I know I sound a little bit like a broken record but we hear so often about growth mindset about giving the right form of Praise but it's not often that we are told when to give that praise and the short answer of course is doesn't matter in fact we should always be striving to give others and ourselves praise that is correctly attached to genuine effort and that word correctly is important here I'm not saying you know take a kid who performed poorly on an exam because they kind of loafed or the kid that was just shuffling their feet out on the soccer field and say hey great you know you you worked so hard when they didn't you know we know when we're being lied to or when we're lying to ourselves but that should give you a sense of control not a sense of lack of control because ultimately effort is something that we can control in fact whenever I hear the term control what you can control I get a little bit nauseated and a little bit irritated too because it's never clear what people are referring to when they say control what you can control focus on what you can control what's the thing that we all really can control it's our level of persistence and our level of effort and of course we all have different circumstances such that persistence and effort can be harder in certain circumstances and for certain people certainly but at the end of the day at the end of the year and at the end of our life really the only thing that you really truly can control is where you place your attention and where you place your effort those are the two things that are really inherent to you and your nervous system no one can do the effort for us no one can direct our attention for us things and people can try and divert or distract our attention and our effort but ultimately effort and attention that is intrinsic motivation come as the name suggests directly from us okay so it's clear that we have a striking set of results in the literature and again major hat tip to Carol dweck and her colleagues for making this discovery right it is what eventually led to the discovery of growth mindset and it's what we're really building up to here okay so this early work from dweck and colleagues and by early I mean late 90s right is really spectacular it really transformed the way that we think about education and learning in general and in fact neuroplasticity but what it didn't answer is why you know why is it that effort praise leads to better performance and intelligence praise identity praise leads to diminished performance and it turns out that the answer resides in how people respond to errors how they respond to feedback that they did not want and there's a really nice study that looked at this mechanistically in the brain to ask what's going on under the hood meaning within the brain when people who have one mindset or another adopt a growth mindset that is the idea that if they engage in effort that they can get better at things or if they have what's called a fixed mindset this idea that if they're not performing well it must be because they just simply can't perform well they don't have the capacity or the ability to perform well so the study I'm referring to is a study first author mangles last author no surprise Carol dweck and it's entitled why do beliefs about intelligence influence learning success a social cognitive Neuroscience model I'm not going to go into all the details of the study but the study used what's called erps event related potentials event related potentials are measured by putting a cap on the skull that has a bunch of electrodes but they don't penetrate the skull they're picking up electrical potentials that correlate with shifts in brain activity now an advantage of erps is that it's pretty non-invasive you can even do it on babies you don't have to cut into the skull you don't have to remove any skin as you would if you were going to you know put electrodes down into the brain which essentially is neurosurgery and it's not as disruptive as being put into a functional magnetic Imaging machine where you're put into a tube and you have to lie motionless for an hour or more actually it was in an MRI machine not for any clinical reason but just as a diagnostic scan recently and nowadays they allow you to watch Netflix in there or do something but you have to stay very very still so it's hard for a lot of people to do that but it can be done if you need it to be done you do it but erps are great because people can come into the laboratory put on this skull cap it's got this funny thing or it looks funny with all these little wires coming out of it and you can get a fairly good measure of Global levels of activity across the brain you can't really pinpoint fine structures and you can't look at brain activity deep in the brain that's probably the major drawback of looking at these erps but you can see global shifts in activity across the brain and the other Advantage is you can do that while people are engaging a lot of different types of tasks you can move around a lot whereas when you're in an MRI machine you're in that little tube you can't really do much so this study had people equipped with these skull caps looks like a kind of like a hoodie with a bunch of wires coming out of it and they had them play a game basically what they did is they were asked questions these are trivia type questions like what's the capital of Australia Australians you're not allowed to answer that question but everyone else should try and then here I'm paraphrasing people indicate their confidence in how accurate they were with the response okay so they ask them a question like what's the capital of Australia the person would answer and then they say how confident are you on a scale of say one to ten that you got the answer correct and then they were given two pieces of feedback and the first piece of feedback provided information only about their response accuracy were they right or were they not right and then the second feedback was they got the correct answer so this is a pretty clever experimental design because it allowed the researchers to look at people's thinking as they're trying to get the right answer then compare that to how confident they were that they had the right answer right you could imagine that if someone was really confident like if you ask me what's your name and I say Andrew what's my confidence that my name is Andrew 75 just kidding 100 okay 100 whereas if you asked me um I was confronted this the other day uh in your physics class when they talked about the right hand rule which is if you're listening don't don't worry about it it's just when you put out your index finger your middle finger and your thumb with your right hand in the right hand rule is the magnetic field the the middle finger the index finger the thumb and I'm pretty sure that it's pretty sure that it's the the magnetic field is the the middle finger that's the vector of the middle finger but how confident am I in this result I don't know maybe 50 because it's been a while since I've looked at this stuff and I should know this but I haven't looked at so 50 when you give people these kinds of questions while recording brain activity you're getting a lot of information you're looking at accuracy you're also looking at confidence you're looking at lack of confidence and you can correlate that with different patterns of brain activity now they had essentially two groups of people in the study one group had an intelligence mindset they believed intelligence was more or less fixed the other had what we call a growth mindset they believed that through effort that intelligence was malleable that people could learn new information including themselves they could learn new information and you wouldn't necessarily think that these two groups would show different patterns of brain activity in response to getting things right or wrong while their brain was being imaged but in fact that's exactly what happened there's a certain waveform of activity the name isn't really important you call it the P3 wave in these Erp experiments P3 wave is a certain pattern of activity that emerged during the presentation to the subject that they gotten something wrong so the P3 wave it's just a little blippin neural activity in the brain correlated with when people were told nope you got that one wrong okay and what was really interesting is that the height of the P3 this let's just call it an error signal because it correlated with the error signal this nope you got it wrong signal in the brain that signal was larger in people with a fixed mindset as opposed to in people with the growth mindset now what was especially interesting is that the location of that activity was above a brain area called the interior cingulate cortex the ACC the anterior cingulate cortex is a structure involved in many different functions in the brain but one of its primary functions is that in the front of the ACC what we call the rostral or anterior ACC ivity there tends to correlate with emotional responses it tends to correlate with our internal sense so-called enteroception whereas in the dorsal ACC meaning the top of the ACC activity there tends to correlate with cognitive information and cognitive appraisal meaning this structure has a lot of different functions but it's got a little area within it that tends to be more related to our emotional or somatic responses to things and it's got another area inside of it the tends to be more related to our thinking our cognition and what was really interesting is that in the group that had the fixed mindset when they were told that they got something wrong there tended to be a greater signal in that rostral or anterior ACC meaning they had a bigger emotional response to it or at least the neural activity suggested that whereas people with a growth mindset when presented with ah you got something wrong the error signal the error signal within their brain tended to reside or even to shift toward areas that are associated with cognitive appraisal and so the conclusion of this study as well as other studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging that have looked at similar tasks is that when people have a growth mindset and they are presented with the information that they got something wrong rather than just feel it as a somatic response or an emotional response they tend to appraise it they tend to direct their attentional resources toward trying to understand what the error was and why they got that error and this I believe is absolutely fundamental to understanding the distinction between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset because perhaps you've seen these lists these you know side-by-side lists that you know a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset you know a fixed mindset is one in which you're trying to look smart that you're not so focused on effort that your response to setbacks is to give up you know and your academic and other forms of performance tends to be low whereas in a growth mindset your goal tends to be to learn you tend to Value effort more you tend to respond to setbacks by working harder and your performance is higher and I'm not trying to make light of these lists these lists are important because they help us organize our information and differentiate between a fixed versus growth mindset but they don't tell us why focusing on effort and engaging more effort would actually translate into higher performance for instance you could imagine a scenario where the exact opposite is true right we can make up a just so story where if your identity is so rigidly fixed to high performance you're likely to outwork everybody right that seems like a logical conclusion as well but that's not the way it plays out it's when your identity is attached to yourself sense of ability to engage in ongoing effort especially when you receive signals that you're getting things wrong or not performing well that is tied to elevated performance in the study using erps tells us that's likely to be the case because of how people who have a growth mindset Focus their attention when they're told nope you got that wrong or when people think they got something right right they give an answer and they say what's your confidence level and they say 90 maybe 99 maybe even 100 percent it's wrong people who have a fixed mindset focus on the emotional response to that more of their brain resources are devoted to I got it wrong I thought I got it right then the people who have a growth mindset who are thinking wait okay then what was that answer and how could I possibly get that answer wrong I'm going to figure that out okay now as you're hearing this you're probably thinking oh no I'm somebody who reflexively gets disappointed when I get something wrong well fortunately this is not just about that 100 milliseconds to five seconds after you're told something is wrong you can shift from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset response in fact that's an important tool that we all need to learn how to implement we all suffer from fixed mindset all suffer from fixed mindset in certain Endeavors and when we get things wrong especially when there's some embarrassment or shame which often accompanies when we think we were very right we're convinced we're right that fixed mindset can really hijack our emotional response but there are a lot of data that point to the fact that at those moments if we think okay I'm going to step back from that and I'm going to just think about the error I'm going to think about what led to the error and I'm going to start devoting my intentional resources to that process that process itself can be built up over time such that we start to outweigh the fixed mindset with growth mindset simply by devoting our attentional resources to the error acknowledging it happened maybe feeling something about it maybe not it's really hard to control our feelings what we can control as I mentioned before is our effort and our attention so focusing our attention on why we got something wrong and really digging into that that's growth mindset in action so you'll notice as we have this discussion about the more mechanistic underpinnings of growth mindset is that we're not talking about psychological terms as much we're not talking about ego protection we're not talking about identity now all of those things are extremely important but the problem with things like ego protection and identity is that when we are faced with results that we don't want and we are faced with those results in a real world context like we're not getting the results we want in school in work in athletics in relationships Etc we hear these messages and we try to for instance you know set our ego aside or you know not attach our identity so much to what is happening but it's really really hard and it's really really hard because statements like set your ego aside or don't attach yourself to it so much are wonderful aspirations but there's no actual process that one can go through by oneself that allows you to immediately disentangle yourself from your ego right I mean there's this whole process of ego dissolution that we talked about in the episode with Robin cardard Harris but none of that was directed at specific challenges that one is undertaking in real time right so when you're faced with results that you don't like you can't simply step back nor should you expect yourself to be able to step back and say oh I'm not going to get upset about this error right it makes perfect sense why you would get upset about not getting the results that you want however once you start to understand some of the mechanistic underpinnings of what will allow you to rescue your performance that is to start focusing on those errors from a more cognitive and a slightly less emotional stance or even a combination of emotional and cognitive right because it's very hard to suppress our emotional response to something but oftentimes we can enhance our attentional or cognitive response to Something in parallel with that and in doing so we can kind of Rob some of the emotional response and when we do that sort of thing it's hard and anytime we do hard things we generally want to know that the doing of those hard things is working that it's in service to something and the study I just reviewed as well as what I'm going to talk about next really points to the fact that building up a practice a capacity of focusing on one's effort on focusing on the errors one made from a cognitive standpoint and really trying to understand what led to those errors is the basis it's the Cornerstone of building up growth mindset it does however require that we don't just tell ourselves to focus on effort and the errors and analyzing those errors it also requires an additional piece which is what we're going to talk about now I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tests out there you get information back about blood lipids about hormones and so on but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids what those hormone levels etc mean and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term Health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both apob and of insulin which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off okay so by now I like to think that we all understand what growth mindset is and what differentiates it from a fixed mindset however just understanding what growth mindset is and how having a desire to implement it and a bit of understanding of how to implement it turns out to be necessary but not sufficient there's an additional piece that we need to accomplish the good news is that additional piece is very straightforward to understand if we zoom out and we start to really understand that growth mindset is really a way of connecting motivation to cognition it's taking this thing that we call motivation which is of course what we all want we all want to be motivated we all want to be effort driven Etc and we take motivation and we tie it to a set of specific thoughts or thought processes that we can control that is Far and Away different than looking at motivation simply as an emotional or an internal state of quote unquote feeling motivated and in fact that's what most people including myself default to we want to feel motivated so fortunately we try and get good sleep which is essential that really helps for daytime mood focus and alertness and thereby motivation we hydrate we exercise we might even drink caffeine as a way to increase our level of alertness and motivation and all of that is finding good in fact all of that is encouraged although I would say that the caffeine part is optional but all those other things are encouraged toward mental health physical health and performance and motivation but what growth mindset is really about is it's taking this thing that we call motivation and it's saying okay what are the specific types of thoughts and actually the specific thoughts the specific cognitive processes that will allow us to feel more motivated especially under conditions where we feel something is hard where we are not getting the results we want and in order to master that process we need to embrace another mindset that's right in order to access growth mindset it's very clear that we need to be able to think about errors and we need to overcome errors and we need to devote our attention to errors and we need to devote our attention to reframing what's going on in our head when we're feeling not motivated Etc and all of that is really hard to do from a purely psychological standpoint but there's this additional mindset which has to do with our mindset around stress and frustration itself that can allow us to access growth mindset far more easily and this mindset around stress actually has a name it's called the stress is enhancing mindset and there's a very straightforward way to increase your stress is enhancing mindset so first I want to step back and acknowledge the person who really made some of the key fundamental discoveries in this area that we call stresses enhancing mindsets and that's Dr Alia sometimes referred to as Dr Ali Crum she's a tenured professor of psychology at Stanford she also is a former division one athlete and a licensed clinical psychologist she's an absolute Phenom and I promise you that she is so successful in all those categories by way of immense amounts of effort in addition to that she also happens to be an incredibly kind person and generous person she was a guest on this podcast previously you can find that episode in the show note captions or by going to hubermanlab.com and simply searching for mindset crumb c-r-u-m her personal story and her work and the tool she offers are absolutely spectacular however you don't need to go to that episode just yet I'm going to talk about some of those tools now and I'm going to talk about how using those tools can allow you to access growth mindset and then I'm going to talk about how the combination of applying a stress is enhancing mindset with a growth mindset acts synergistically to even further improve performance in the short and long run the stresses enhancing mindset is the outgrowth of many different studies and not just from Dr Ali Crum but from others as well but for the time being I want to focus on one paper in which Dr Crum was the first author so this work was done before she arrived at Stanford the paper is entitled rethinking stress the role of mindsets in determining the stress response and the key takeaway from this paper is that how we think about stress impacts how we react to stress so much so in fact that what this paper illustrates is that if people are given even just a short tutorial about some of the negative consequences of stress on learning and performance and their physiology and their health they experience a lot of negative consequences of stress when they are put into a stressful circumstance conversely if people are taught about the performance enhancing aspects of stress then those people will experience performance enhancement when they are confronted with stress in a learning or other performance type environment so what we are talking about here is not the placebo effect I want to be very clear about that we are also not talking about lying to people in order to shift their response to stress what we're talking about here is two different conditions one condition where people are exposed to information that is true about how stress can diminish performance and another condition in which people are exposed to information that is also true about how stress can enhance performance now you might be saying how can it be true that stress is both performance diminishing and stress is performance enhancing and ah therein lies the key takeaway from this paper it depends on what you believe about stress in fact a different way to umbrella this whole discussion is to say that how you think about stress impacts the stress response in profound ways so this paper rethinking stress the role of mindsets and determining stress did a very simple set of manipulations they had people in one group listen to a lecture that effectively was titled quote the effects of stress are negative and should be avoided and that lecture included information about how stress diminishes performance and how it can diminish health and vitality learning and performance productivity it increases uncertainty Etc okay and all of that information is true a separate group listened to a lecture entitled quote experiencing stress improves health and vitality and again that information is true now I realize that some of you are probably still asking how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance and the answer lies in two things one the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress the duration over which the stress response occurs but the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress Okay so we've got a condition here where people are being informed very differently about what stress does in one case it's the stresses bad message in the other case it's the stress is good message and there are many different experiments within this paper but one of the more interesting ones I believe is where they looked at work performance both in terms of performance of what they call soft tasks so these are somewhat easier tasks as well as hard tasks and when you look at the group that was given information about how stress diminishes performance in the soft tasks okay so the somewhat easy task You Don't See Much change in their performance as you compare the before the learning about stress is diminishing to after the learning whereas the people who learn that stress is enhancing actually experience some improvement in work performance even though the challenge that they're facing isn't that great so again what this means is that learning that stress can enhance performance by providing people true information about how stress can enhance performance can increase performance even in the context of stuff that's not that hard not that stressful even more interesting is that when you look at performance on tasks that are considered hard and you compare the stresses diminishing group meaning the group that was taught that stress is diminishing and compare that to the stresses enhancing group you see a really Divergent response the people that learn that stress diminishes performance did not improve at all whereas the people that learn that stress can enhance performance enhance their performance significantly now keep in mind all they are doing is learning that stress can enhance their performance and then they're given the task and they're performing better so that's pretty spectacular right there's no training session that they went and did they didn't practice these items that they were being tested on in between they weren't given a bunch of you know drills to do and they didn't take a lot of time to do it they just heard a tutorial about how stress can enhance performance and that I believe is remarkable because what it says is that our cognitive appraisal about stress which we all are going to experience in life right elevated heart rate narrowing a visual Focus you know shifting of blood away from the periphery all of these things are characteristic features of the stress response that we learn especially in this day and age because it's talked about a lot in popular culture that oh you know all of the these mechanisms were put into us in order for us to get away from the saber-toothed tiger or the or the line that's trying to eat us let's be fair the stress response is there for a lot of reasons not just because of saber-toothed tigers and lions I mean that's kind of a story that we make up the stress response is inherent not just to us but to other species as a way to mobilize us either away from things or toward things right we need to have somewhat of a stress response in order to engage in adaptive challenge yes it's true that hundreds and thousands of years ago those adaptive challenges probably involved hunting but they probably involved Social Challenges as well do you think it was you know easy for cavemen and women to engage socially and you know kind of settle out their romantic interactions Etc do you think it was easy for them to raise children no of course not the stress response is there for a variety of reasons not just to get away from predators the really exciting thing that's been discovered in the course of Ali krum's work and other work in the last couple of decades is that the stress response is neither good nor bad the stress response depends on whether or not you believe the sensations that you're experiencing elevated heart rate narrowing a visual Focus Etc are serving to enhance your performance or diminish your performance and this study really points to the fact that just learning that it can enhance performance can enhance performance now I know a number of you are probably saying wait but stress doesn't feel good right and oftentimes we experience stress under conditions where we're trying to learn or get good at something or listen better or do something and it actually is diminishing performance I think it's important to acknowledge that this study and studies like it are not saying that stress becomes pleasant as a sensation in the body nor is it saying that it always leads to improved performance I don't want you to think that's the take-home message sometimes it does it can as was demonstrated in this research paper but oftentimes as we know stress diminishes our performance it takes us away from the landmarks we want to hit it takes us away from the grades we want to get it takes us away from quote unquote showing up how we want to right no one wants to have the blotchy skin and the sweating and the quaking of voice when we're trying to do public speaking and things of that sort no one wants any of that what's important to understand is that learning that stress is a way of mobilizing resources in the body does two things first of all it allows us to dampen or adjust the stress response in real time and it allows us to understand that that stress response heightens our level of focus in a way that allows us to pay attention to the things that are going wrong in a way that allows us us to make correction to those errors in the future so if you think back to that study that Erp study where they measured brain activity and they looked at people who had a fixed mindset versus people who had a growth mindset and the people who had a growth mindset were paying more cognitive attention to what was happening during errors and after errors well this stress is enhancing mindset is very powerful because what it does is it shifts one's attention away from the kind of somatic experience of oh my goodness my heart rate is elevated I'm sweating I'm quaking I'm just I sound terrible I feel terrible I look terrible Etc to a mode of allocating more of our thinking toward analyzing why things might be going wrong and something else powerful happens when we Embrace a stresses-enhancing mindset as well when we Embrace a stress is enhancing mindset it turns out that some of the very physiological processes that we call quote unquote stress shift in important ways some of those include the duration over which the stress hormone cortisol is released and in fact I don't even really want to call it a stress hormone because cortisol does so many other things as well and it's not bad you need cortisol believe me you want cortisol especially released early in the day and in response to acute stressors what you don't want is for cortisol to stay elevated for long long periods of time and you especially don't want it to interfere with your sleep okay so much so that I think at times I wonder whether or not our philosophy on stress should be that stress is fantastic for us except when it interferes with our sleep right and when stress becomes terrible for us is when it starts to be chronically elevated and especially when it starts to inhibit our ability to sleep well enough and long enough okay so the point here is that when we Embrace a stressous enhancing mindset we are able to have shorter duration release of cortisol we are also able to engage what's called increased stroke volume under conditions of stress this gets a little bit technical but the amount of blood that your heart can pump with each beat turns out to be a key metric of stress when we are very stressed even though we need to mobilize a lot of resources somewhat paradoxically our total stroke volume can actually be reduced and we tend to shuttle blood and other resources towards the core of our body and towards major Limbs and away from things like our brain and our periphery so one of the key measures of how a stress response quote-unquote is going is how much peripheral blood flow there is and when we are more relaxed under conditions of stress there tends to be more peripheral blood flow when we are more anxious more panicked under conditions of stress peripheral blood flow is lower and in a remarkable set of experiments Ali Crum and colleagues have shown that when we are just taught that stress can be enhancing and then we are placed into a stressful environment either because we are imagining stress or we are experiencing real stress and then our physiology is measured what is observed is that the total amount of blood that the heart can pump with each beat is actually increase peripheral blood flow increases and our ability to maintain cognition to think clearly under conditions of stress increases and again the only manipulation here is a tutorial about how stress can be enhancing which is essentially what I'm telling you right now in fact for those of you that perhaps have heard stress reduces testosterone levels stress reduces estrogen levels Etc that's true it is also True by the way that when you are informed about how stress can be enhancing of performance it becomes anabolic that's right it actually can lead to deployment of androgens and estrogens things that many not all people desire to have increased or certainly desire to not have diminished below their normal Baseline so there's a lot of false stories out there about stress not false because what you're hearing is wrong because indeed chronic stress chronically elevated cortisol can reduce testosterone reduce estrogen diminish sleep diminish immunity Etc but it is also true that stress under conditions where one believes that stress can be enhancing can be anabolic it can be pro-testosterone pro-estrogen it can be pro-cortisol regulation in ways that allow you to focus your cognition and so on and so forth now that's exciting but I do realize that for some people it might be sufficiently vague to make you wonder well how do I know if I'm getting the right response from stress or the wrong response and the simple answer there is the more that you can learn about how stress can enhance performance and the more that you place yourself into safe I want to underscore it safe yet stressful adaptive circumstances these are going to be circumstances where you stand to learn or grow in some positive way not circumstances where you stand to hurt yourself or others of course the more that you can place yourself into conditions of stress and then to cognitively just tell yourself ah this elevated heart rate this um quaking of my hands this you know sweating Etc this is my body mobilizing resources and the more that you can tell yourself that that's actually affording you an advantage in being able to allocate your attention to specific things maybe why you made an error and analyzing that or maybe why you succeeded at something and thinking about the steps that led to that success the more that you can link that back to the processes that are taking you in the directions that you do and don't want to go and thinking about them because indeed that's what stress can allow you to do the more that you are shifting your mind away from thinking about just the raw uncomfortable sensations of stress you're putting a cognitive appraisal on a physiological process you are thinking about stress in a way that is changing what that stress is doing and you're taking your brain and body from a negative State just to put a little bit of subjective valence on it negative right nobody wants to have the bad stress response to a positive State and when you develop a stresses enhancing mindset you not only are going to feel more comfortable under conditions of stress but you're also developing the perfect tool to plug into the whole process of building up your growth mindset in a way that allows those two things growth mindset and stress is enhancing mindset to synergize and to dramatically improve performance in the short and long term and that's not just a statement that I'm making that's what the research tells us so let's take a look at that research so now I'd like to shift our discussion to some very recent findings about growth mindset and how growth mindset combined with the stresses enhancing mindset can powerfully change outcomes for the better and can do so in a huge variety of real world contexts and the work that I'm referring to is the work of a person named David Yeager Dr David Yeager is a professor at the University of Texas Austin he did his graduate work with Carol dweck at Stanford and he now has his own laboratory in Austin and both when he was a graduate student with Carol and in his own laboratory he's been doing very impressive large-scale studies meaning many thousands of subjects so that itself is important and using subjects from diverse areas rural urban Etc different levels of affluence lack of affluence and finding essentially that when students are taught about a growth mindset what it is how it's different than a fixed mindset and when those same students are also taught about what a stress is enhancing mindset is and cultivating that again simply through information tutorial watching a video about growth mindset watching a video about stress is enhancing mindsets and then confronted with stress confronted with Tess confronted with opportunities to embrace hard challenges or easier paths across the board the results show up again and again as students who are taught about a growth mindset and are taught that stress is enhancing perform better now jaegering colleagues have shown that across a huge number of different experiments in fact there's a paper published quite recently this was about a year ago in July of 2022 in the journal Nature so Apex Journal published as a full article in Nature and Science and elsewhere they have letters and shorter formats like reports and then there are the Articles which correspond to major major findings so they published The Following results as an article in nature in July of 2022 the title of the paper is a synergistic mindsets intervention protects adolescents from stress and what I absolutely love about this paper is that it includes a lot of different kinds of experiments so for instance they looked at high school students who simply anticipated a stressful event and had been instructed on growth mindset or stress's enhancing mindset or both or control conditions where they weren't informed of those mindsets right It's always important to have control experiments where you're getting the same amount of information but it's not the same information and what they found was that anticipatory stress right the stress that we feel in anticipation of something that we think is going to happen is reduced when we are educated about growth mindset and we are educated about a stress's enhancing mindset and the basic takeaway from that experiment was yes indeed being educated on what a growth mindset is and how it differs from a fixed mindset which you now have been educated on definitely buffers you against stress in addition being educated on how stress can enhance performance can buffer you against anticipatory stress but it is clearly the case that when one is educated on both of those things growth mindset and stresses enhancing mindsets that one observes the greatest buffering or offset of the stress response in ways that can improve performance now that is but one experiment of the six yes six experiments included in this single Paper now I'm not going to go through each of those six experiments in detail and just as a side note I've invited Dr David Yeager to be a guest on this podcast and he has agreed so when he's a guest on this podcast I'm sure he will detail all the intricacies of those experiments in order to inform us about exactly what was done and how so that we can benefit from that information but just by way of example another experiment in this paper use what was called the trigger social stress test and the reason I'm going to highlight this a little bit is because I think it relates to a lot of things that many of us have experienced and that will experience that are considered stressful and of course we would all like ways to buffer ourselves against stress and or leverage that stress to improve our performance as well as adopt a growth mindset so the try our social stress test is a kind of standard mode of stressing people out in the laboratory or in the classroom where basically a subject comes in you tell them to wait a little bit of time then you measure their stress response at rest you're looking at their heart rate their blood pressure you might have them spit into a little tube and use that saliva to measure cortisol because that's how you measure cortisol then you're going to tell them that they're going to prepare a speech for presentation in front of a small group of actual people then they actually have to deliver that speech in front of that audience during that speech sometimes the people who are observing it are giving feedback like frowns crossed arms Etc then there's a pop quiz where they get a hard arithmetic test in front of that audience and when they get answer is wrong they're told they're wrong in front of that audience this all might seem kind of playful and silly to you but most people do not experience this as playful and silly almost everybody who goes into one of these experiments as a subject feel some level of stress especially those that don't like public speaking especially those that don't see themselves as very proficient in arithmetic or that don't like to work out problems in real time in front of people you can see how this would be stressful and all the while measures of psychological and physiological reactivity are being measured peripheral blood flow the thing we talked about earlier among those what I just described is pretty extensive but I provide all that as a backdrop so that you can understand what happened before which was people were simply educated on growth mindset how it differs from fixed mindset and or stress enhances performance mindset or not so basically what we have here is a condition in which people are just getting information right there's no pill there's no treadmill there's no going home and doing a bunch of problem sets and what they observe in this experiment and all the other experiments contained within this quite massive paper is that the mere learning about growth mindset and stresses enhancing mindsets allows these students to shift their physiology so enhance peripheral blood flow changes in hormone secretion like cortisol n shifts in their psychology such that when they feel stressed they start to see that and experience that as an opportunity for Challenge and to lean into that challenge and where they are told that they got the wrong answer where they are told that they are not performing well they are able to think about that and to allocate their mental resources such that they do start to perform better and the major takeaway from the study is that across the board in all six experiments in Imagine stress in real stress laboratory stress actual classroom stress and in embracing future challenges just the learning about what stress can enhance your performance mindset is allowed students to do just that now another really interesting feature of this study put out by Jager and colleagues was that the interventions were one time and relatively brief or we could even say extremely brief whereas a lot of previous experiments had looked at growth mindset interventions that were on the order of you know four to six to eight tutorials lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour each this experiment employed just one 30-minute intervention so when I heard about these results and read the paper I got very excited I wanted to know what is this magic intervention exactly and I'm sure you're thinking the same so I contacted Dr Yeager and he was gracious enough to provide me some examples of what's contained within this tutorial so that I could give you those examples in real time during this episode so basically the tutorial starts off with a question about stress it actually has a little field where you can fill in an answer to the following question can you recall a time when you experienced stress and what was that stress related to and here I'm paraphrasing so what I put in response to this because I actually filled out the form itself was when I was a postdoc which by the way is the four to six year period of time that comes after your PhD training I wrote when I was a postdoc I was under a lot of competitive pressure to try and finish my projects I was working under a diminished income meaning I wasn't getting paid very much relative to the cost of living in the area I lived at the time and I was also socially isolated from a lot of my friends that previously I had lived very close to that was a stressful time that I could recall in fact no other time in my life as I recall was as stressful as being a postdoc which is not to say that I didn't enjoy being a postdoc I delighted in doing the science I did and being surrounded by the people I was surrounded by but it was very very stressful for those and additional reasons so that's how this tutorial starts off and I believe that the reason that they asked that question at the beginning of the tutorial is to kind of cue up cognitive mechanisms that surround one's own understanding of stress and then as you click through the tutorial it starts to explain of all things neuroscience and neuroplasticity it says research from Neuroscience tells us that through effort our brain can change it can form new connections that we call synapses so of course I was delighted to see all that information I'm very familiar with that type of information It also says things like and here I'm reading directly from the tutorial difficulty struggle and frustration when you're learning something are not signs that you've reached your limits they're signs that you're expanding your limits okay then you go to the next field and it says let's hear from a scientist Urie triceman is one of the top calculus professors here's what he tells us students on the first day of class quote everyone in this class will struggle no matter who you are questions are going to be flying at you that you cannot answer and when that happens you're going to experience stress and if you don't understand that stress you'll think it means oh no I don't belong here but in fact that stress is an indicator that your understanding is deepening it's not a sign that you're not learning it's a sign that you are learning okay so I could read this entire tutorial for you but that would take up far too much of our time but I think you get the essence of it which is that with each slide within the tutorial you're being told that the thing that you're experiencing that could potentially feel negative because it means negative things you're not learning you're suffering you're suffering health-wise you're suffering performance wise is reappraised it's telling you no the frustration the agitation the thought that you're not capable and you're not capable of getting better it's actually the opposite so what this tutorial really is is it's an information based tutorial it tells you something about the brain's capacity to change it gives you some True by the way mechanistic information about how synapses can change and brain circuits can change because indeed they can and it's telling you that the negative somatic bodily and cognitive thought-based experiences of stress that those represent you getting better that's simply what it is and despite it being simple in its specific message that message turns out to be incredibly powerful how can we say that it's truly powerful well we could turn to essentially any page in this study that Jaeger and colleagues did and see that for instance the intervention again this is the combination of learning about growth mindset and learning that stress can be performance enhancing led to 40 Improvement in self-regard so self-regard is something that can be measured we can have very negative or very positive self-regard 40 improvements in self-regard there was a 14 Improvement in passing of courses that were of the particularly challenging type and there was also a significant Improvement in passing of courses that were less challenging in addition to that people who watched and engaged in this 30 minute tutorial also took on additional hard challenges in the future long after the intervention had ceased now there are a number of other features of the David Yeager work that I think are especially important to consider but rather than go into the specifics of those experiments I'm going to frame them in the context of some very specific tools that I've spelled out for sake of this episode based on the scientific literature that you can use in order to build a growth mindset and in order to build the stress enhances performance mindset now in some sense all of our discussion during this episode up until now has served as a tutorial about growth mindset and about stress enhances performance and how those two things can be combined in order to get a synergistic positive effect nonetheless I do think that it's useful especially when thinking about cognitive tools which are often less concrete and clear to people how they can Implement them compared to say exercise tools like you know get two 100 minutes of Zone 2 cardio per week or get six sets of resistance exercise per major muscle group per week Etc all of that stuff in the physical domain is very concrete whereas stuff that relates to tools in the cognitive domain sometimes can feel a little bit abstract so for that we reason I'm just going to take a couple of minutes and list off some of the key elements to building up a growth mindset and a stress enhances performance mindset that are gleaned from the literature that I've talked about now and related literature the first tool is that whenever possible if both the teacher and the student can adopt a growth mindset and a stress enhances performance mindset that's the best case scenario this has been shown in the classroom and it's been shown in other contexts as well and again it simply means learning about what growth mindset is and how it differs from fixed mindset it also ideally means learning how stress can enhance performance now if that means spending some time with the discussion that we had around Dr Alia crum's data that would be great if it also means just thinking about the stress response and understanding that that stress response indeed is mobilizing resources it's focusing your vision more narrowly right you sort of lose the forest through the trees and yet that allows you to really analyze carefully whatever it is that you choose to focus your attention on well then that's going to be performance enhancing again these tools are purely cognitive but they are well supported by the data and the data also tell us that when teachers and students both adopt this mindset the teachers are viewing the students as less fixed in their abilities and the students are viewing themselves as less fixed in their abilities the next tool which is a really fundamental one to everything we're talking about was actually mentioned at the beginning of the episode which is whenever giving praise or giving feedback of any kind to others or to yourself perhaps even especially to yourself make the effort to make that feedback about verbs not labels okay to really think about praising or in some cases maybe giving feedback about how effort could have been better but ideally you're saying great effort it was great that when you missed that shot on goal that you ran back to your side of the field it was great that when you didn't perform well on that math exam that you went back to those problem sets and that you conversed with other students about why they had performed a certain way and you really dug through it and figured out why you got things wrong now a key aspect of this tool of focusing on verbs not labels is that it is especially important to do this when you've performed well I talked about the reasons a little bit earlier but I cannot emphasize this enough when you've performed well if you tell yourself or you tell somebody else that they're just a great athlete they're just a great student they're talented they're brilliant I promise you you are undermining their future performance when they inevitably encounter challenge if however you give yourself or the other person feedback that's really grounded in effort and persistence in problem solving you are absolutely going the right direction now if you are going to give feedback about errors either to yourself or to somebody else the question really is do you paint that with rose-colored glasses do you try and make it seem like the errors weren't that bad that's not actually what we're talking about we're not talking about what do they say putting lipstick on a pig what we're talking about is looking at those errors and thinking about what led up to those errors and trying to put more of our cognitive attention on the verbs the things that led to those errors and less of our attention on the emotions related to those errors we really need to be analytic about those errors and admittedly we often need to take a day or two or maybe even longer before we can do that process effectively right nothing that I've said thus far has said that we have to do all of this immediately after an error or immediately after a poor performance sometimes we are so caught up in the emotional experience of having performed not as well as we would have liked that there's simply no way that we can allocate our mental resources toward error analysis ideally we can but oftentimes we can so we have to be how do they say gentle with ourselves and allow ourselves to move through that process and then get back to error analysis that's absolutely key but we really want to focus on the verbs leading to those errors not putting labels on the stupid ridiculous silly fill in your blank with whatever negative label you might happen to come up with okay so verbs verbs verbs for analyzing why we did well and verbs verbs verbs for analyzing why we did poorly now you may have noticed that a few minutes ago I mentioned that oftentimes it's beneficial that when we make errors that we seek out others who either performed well ideally but also those who performed poorly in order to get some understanding as to why we did not perform as well as we wanted and that raises another key tool there are a lot of data now to support the fact that one of the key ways to analyze our errors is to get help and this is one of the things that really differentiates the high performers from the low performers over time and yes there I just used a label well I guess I could have said the high effort which leads to Performance people versus the low effort which leads to low performance people but in any case you get the idea people who perform well over time regardless of labels that we place on them tend to be people who seek help in order to understand why they didn't perform well so this is a core component of not just trying and building a growth mindset but really solidifying a growth mindset and a stress can enhance performance mindset so seek help from others in understanding where you didn't perform as well as you like and I would say Seek input from others as to what were the verbs that you think might have led to your heightened performance because we like to think that we have really good Optics on why we did well oh yeah it was because I spent X number of hours practicing but oftentimes those around us have additional perspectives that we can't access and learning about those perspectives of why we've performed poorly but also why we performed well in the context of these verbs not labels is also tremendously beneficial the other thing that's clear from the literature on growth mindset and stress can enhance performance mindset is that all of that stuff all those tutorials are most effective when both teachers and students Embrace those mindsets now that's a wonderful situation if teachers and students are both available and willing to learn those mindsets however for many of us we don't have a teacher we don't have a mentor we're doing all of this on our own and so what's fortunate is that there are also data in the literature showing that under conditions where either the teacher or the mentor is not there or is not embracing a growth mindset or stress enhances performance mindset we actually can serve as our own teacher by using a simple tool and the simple tool that was actually the same tool that was used in one of the Jaeger studies is to take maybe a three by five card or an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper and write out a letter as if you're writing a letter to the next person coming along trying to get good at the thing that you're trying to get good at and explain to them what growth mindset is and how it differs from a fixed mindset explain to them what the stress enhances performance mindset is how to adopt it and how it can amplify performance that simple exercise of writing a letter which is essentially to oneself but you're sort of pretending that the letter is for somebody else although I suppose you could and perhaps should give it to somebody else so they can benefit that simple exercise has been shown to improve one's own performance and to do so in dramatic ways not just in the immediate term but also in the future now the final tool I'd like to share is one that I've come up with but it's one that's really grounded in the Neuroscience of neuroplasticity and believe it or not that's grounded in our understanding of exercise physiology and that is to reframe this idea that the mind is like a muscle I know we hear that over and over again the mind is like a muscle you know you exercise a muscle it gets stronger you exercise your mind you put it through some strain and you can learn those statements are absolutely true but this statement that the mind is like a muscle that analogy falls short I believe in an important way that can lead a lot of people astray when they try and embrace growth mindset and the stress enhances performance mindset and the reason I say that is the following exercise with weights or resistance training of any kind whether or not it's body weight or machines or free weights has an incredible property to it in that it increases blood flow to the muscles that we're training right this is something that really distinguishes resistance training from other forms of training like long distance running when we train our muscles with resistance the blood flow into that muscle the so-called pump gives us a sort of a hint or a window of the growth of that muscle that is likely to occur if we allow that muscle to recover after that resistance training in other words resistance training provides us a kind of hint of the results we are likely to get so when we hear the analogy that the mind is like a muscle I think it falls short because when we strain to learn something with our mind we don't actually get to feel what it is to perform much better as we are trying to learn that thing actually quite the contrary in fact much of what we've been talking about today is the fact that the stress and strain and the disappointment that is so reflexively felt when we look at our diminished performances we're trying to learn is actually the trigger for invoking the learning itself so what I'm saying here is that it is not the case that when we go in to learn a language or a new skill or mathematics or something new that for a moment we are fluent or partially fluent and then we lose that ability when we walk out of the classroom or the tutorial that's what makes it different than the gym where you go and you lift weights or you use a resistance training of any kind and you get this sort of window into oh this is what the muscle will feel like and look like when it's larger so the mind is like a muscle analogy sort of works in the sense that if you properly stress a muscle using resistance training and then you give it an adequate amount of time to recover it indeed will get bigger and stronger and it is true that when you go in to try and learn something if you provide the adequate stress which is hitting that point where you're not understanding the information it's not sinking in and you give yourself some time to recover which requires sleep by the way then you'll learn that new information over time but where the mind is like a muscle analogy really Falls away I believe is that the mind is not like a muscle because you don't actually get to experience the good growth that you're seeking as you're trying to learn it rather everything we've been talking about today is about learning how to experience the strain of trying to learn the agitation of trying to learn as the learning process itself and understanding that while you might feel back on your heels a little or a lot during that process that you might and in fact very likely are going to experience all the category of things that go along with stress elevated heart rate frustration you know maybe even a little headache or strain difficulty maintaining Focus Etc that if you understand that all of those things are actually creating the specific neurochemical and neural circuit conditions to invoke learning well then that learning will occur so in some ways a better analogy would be if it were the case that when you do resistance training that your muscles actually got smaller during the training and then rebounded to being even bigger than they were prior to the training that would be the appropriate analogy for the mind is like a muscle I say all this because yes adopting a growth mindset is incredibly valuable adopting a stress can enhance performance mindset is incredibly valuable and even more valuable is combining those two mindsets because they do indeed improve performance synergistically however none of this process is expected to be reflexive for most people perhaps for anybody and the process of building up these mindsets involves another mindset which is the one that umbrellas them all or gathers them all together and makes them really work which is the idea that mindsets are indeed powerful that they can have a real effect and that while they do take time to cultivate they can be cultivated thank you for joining me today for our discussion about growth mindset what it is and how to cultivate

Title: Dr. Robert Malenka: How Your Brain’s Reward Circuits Drive Your Choices
Published: 2023-07-10 12:00:17 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Robert Malenka, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine who has made numerous seminal discoveries of how the brain changes (neuroplasticity) in response to learning and in response to rewarding and reinforcing experiences. We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.

Transcript Language: English
Andrew Huberman: [OPENING THEME MUSIC] Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Robert Malenka. Dr. Robert Malenka is a professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is both medical doctor, an MD, and a researcher, a PhD. His laboratory is famous for having discovered some of the key components allowing neuroplasticity, that is, the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. In addition, Dr. Malanka's research is considered central to the textbook knowledge about how reward systems in the brain are organized and function. Indeed, Dr. Melanca's research over the last ten or 15 years has merged what was once two disparate fields, the first being the study of neuroplasticity, again, the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience, and the other field being the field of dopamine as it relates to pleasure and addiction. His laboratory has shown, for instance, that when we seek out particular forms of pleasure, regardless of whether or not they are healthy for us, that changes the way that our reward circuitry works and actually changes the way that dopamine is released and how it impacts the brain. And his work has also informed how we seek out healthy pleasures, including healthy food and social connection. Today's discussion explores all of these topics, and by the end of today's discussion, you will have a rich understanding of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin work in parallel, to reinforce that is, to increase the probability that we will engage in certain types of thinking and behaviors. So if you are somebody interested in neuroplasticity, that is, how the nervous system can change in response to experience and or you are interested in reward systems, what motivates us, and what we are likely to pursue in the future, given our choices of past, and if you are interested in things like social connection and empathy, or lack thereof, today's discussion encompasses all of those topics. It is worth mentioning that Dr. Malenka is a true luminary in all of the fields I just mentioned, as well as several other fields. In fact, when you look out on the landscape of modern neuroscience, what you'll discover is that a very large percentage of the top laboratories studying neuroplasticity and reward systems and so on, all stemmed from having trained in Dr. Malenka's laboratory. So it's a real honor and pleasure to be able to host him today, and I'm sure that our discussion is going to greatly enrich the way that you think about brain function, neuroplasticity, and reward. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA understands those challenges and the biology of the visual system such that they've designed sunglasses and eyeglasses that always allow you to see with crystal clarity. Now, initially, ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for sports performance, and as a consequence, all of their glasses are designed to be very lightweight and to not slip off your face if you get sweaty. However, the design of the glasses includes some that are specifically for sport and others whose aesthetic really allows you to use them for sport, as well as out to dinner or to work, etc. And that's how I use them. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code HUBERMAN to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's roka.com, and enter the code HUBERMAN at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose, or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels, to maintain energy and focus. Throughout the day, you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or dips. Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations, as well as food timing and things like exercise, combine to impact your blood glucose levels. I started using Levels a little over a year ago, and it gave me a lot of insight into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards, as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy. And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on, such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman right now, Levels is offering an additional two free months of membership. Again, that's levels.link L-I-N-K /huberman to get two free months of membership. And now for my discussion with Dr. Robert Malenka. Dr. Melanka, Rob, welcome. Robert Malenka: Yeah, thanks for having me. Andrew Huberman: Delighted to have you here, both for sake of your medical knowledge and training as a psychiatrist and of course as a luminary in the field of neuroplasticity, dopamine and reward systems, social systems, your knowledge of autism and social interactions, a newer interest in, or perhaps old interest in psychedelics and what they're doing and potential for mental health. There are just so many things that you've done in this field. I've been a long, longtime fan of your work. Since your days as an assistant professor, I've tracked your career. I've learned a tremendous amount from you by observing you and from being your colleague. So really delighted to have you here. Robert Malenka: You're making me blush, and I don't blush easily. Andrew Huberman: Well, it's all true. Robert Malenka: Thank you. Andrew Huberman: And I will say as well, you've also trained an enormous number of incredible scientists. Karl Deisseroth, the Karl Deisseroth, Anna Lemke always speaks incredibly highly of you as a mentor and somebody she's learned a tremendous amount from and pretty much anyone that's worked on neuroplasticity, on dopamine and reward systems, addiction, and now in the fields of autism and soon psychedelics as well, references you often, and you've been mentioned many times before on this podcast, if not by name, by work. So again, thank you for being here. I'd love to kick off the conversation by talking about something which is very fundamental to everything we're going to talk about, but certainly fundamental to our daily lives, which is dopamine. We hear so much about dopamine. People talk about dopamine hits. People think about dopamine as pleasure, dopamine reward for the novice. How would you frame the dopamine system? I mean, it does a bunch of different things in different areas of the brain and body, but to you what does dopamine represent as its major function in the brain? And could you give us a kind of general contour of the neural circuits that allow this chemical to more or less put value on our experiences? Robert Malenka: Yeah, that's very well put. As you point out, dopamine is one of the major, what we term neuromodulators in the brain, a chemical signaling messenger that the brain uses to mediate a complex array of actions. Its best well known function is in what we call the brain's reward circuitry. So this is a circuit in the brain. And when we use the term circuit, what we really mean is one part of the brain communicating with another part of the brain. Because the brain is this very complex, it's the most complex organ in the universe, with lots of different nerve cells talking to each other simultaneously. And as neuroscientists, we try to parse what different brain areas are doing and what different neuromodulators might be doing, and dopamine was discovered, oh, I should know this, many decades ago. And it's, as I said, the major chemical messenger molecule in the so called brain's reward circuitry. And when you're talking about, so what is the brain's reward circuitry? This is a part of the brain that tells us something is reinforcing in our environment. Some stimuli is "rewarding," makes us feel better or good, although that's a gross oversimplification. Before getting into the details of dopamine and its function in the reward circuitry, I think it's useful to talk about, why do we need a reward circuitry? Why do we need something in our brain that tells us, this feels good or this feels bad, and it goes back to evolution. I am a biological scientist. That means I believe in evolution. And if you think about the evolution of our species, everything is driven by developing mechanisms that increase our survival. And it's really useful, you need something in your nervous system that tells you some stimuli in your environment is important for your survival, or some stimulus in your environment is dangerous. So it's not magic that sugary, high fat laden foods are highly reinforcing and rewarding. It's not an accident. There has to be a mechanism in the brain that tells us that. It's not an accident, that most of the time, for most of us, a sexual experience is pretty reinforcing, is pretty rewarding. It's not an accident that warmth feels really good when you're cold. That water tastes much better when you're really thirsty. What evolved is a mechanism to tell our nervous systems and tell our brains, this feels pretty good, I should repeat the behavior that leads to that rewarding experience. And similarly, it's really important when there is an event in your life that's highly dangerous for some mechanism in your brain to say, whoa, I don't want to go back to where that lion was. And we can get into that. So this was a long winded way of saying what the reward circuitry tells us is this event, this stimulus. It could be an external stimulus, like I said, a Krispy Kreme donut, which I happen to love. And I have to be very disciplined, so I don't eat too many of them. It could be a drug of abuse, and maybe we'll talk about that a little bit. All of these stimuli seem to activate and cause the release of dopamine in this brain's reward circuitry. So now we need to get into a little bit of detail. Neuroscientists use these very unfriendly terms to describe different brain regions. So the home of dopamine cells, or brain cells, are called neurons. So the home of dopamine neurons are in a part of the brain, sort of what we call the lower midbrain. The dopamine neurons that are part of the reward circuitry are found in this area called the ventral tegmental area, which, I'm sorry to have to use such technical jargon, we call it the VTA. That's the acronym. Andrew Huberman: I think the roof o f the midbrain is the tectum, it means roof, and the base of the midbrain, it means floor, which is the tegmentum. So there's a rationale, but it doesn't help much at all to know the names. Robert Malenka: And, in fact, you are absolutely correct, and I always forget that. So thank you for pointing that out. Andrew Huberman: It's a side effect of teaching neuronatomy. Robert Malenka: Which I once did back in the early 80s, but I've forgotten everything I taught. Anyhow, so these dopamine neurons, and we can talk about other types of dopamine neurons, they send messages, what we call projections, using telegraph wires that we call axons. They send projections to many different brain regions, the key one in the brain's reward circuitry being an area, again, with a very complicated name called the nucleus accumbens, and maybe Andrew. You know, I actually don't know how that name evolved, the nucleus accumbens. And I'm sure I should know, because I've been studying it for 30 years, but I have never looked up the genesis of that name. Andrew Huberman: Well, the fortunate thing about this podcast is it's both on audio platforms like Spotify and Apple, but also on YouTube. And so now we can be absolutely sure that somebody has put it into the YouTube comments underneath this episode, and therefore everyone will learn, including us. Robert Malenka: So I don't know the origins of t he word nucleus, and it's a gross oversimplification, but it's the activity of these dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area that then cause the release of this powerful neuromodulator, dopamine, in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of another brain structure with a tough to remember name called the ventral striatum. And then magic happens, and when I say magic happens, even though we've been studying how dopamine modifies the properties of cells in this nucleus accumbens, the truth is, we don't have a deep mechanistic understanding why, when dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens, we experience that. As I'm being very cautious here, the simple way would be to say as highly rewarding, but it's a little more complicated than that. What it tells us is that there's something really important happening in our environment. Andrew Huberman: So could we say that it cues the arousal system? Robert Malenka: It gets the arousal system going. There're close ties to our memory systems, which hopefully, intuitively, makes some sense if something really important is happening in your environment. Because, again, I think what's helpful for your audience is to always be thinking about how these systems evolved from an evolutionary perspective. And if dopamine is signaling something really important and salient is happening in your environment, you want to remember that it could be a highly rewarding experience, like a source of food for me. I like all donuts, so I don't want to emphasize any one manufacturer of one donut versus the other. I like sugar laden, fat laden foods. That's why I never eat them, because I like them so much. And I use that as an example, but because that was an important event for my survival. This reward circuitry, yes, it stimulates my arousal system. It gets me to pay attention. It also has very close ties to memory systems. And to go off on a little bit of a tangent, I think the one, I don't want to say it's a mistake, I think perhaps somewhat oversimplification of how people conceptualize dopamine's role in the brain is, even though it's a major, important role, is for it to be active and released during highly reinforcing experiences like sex, like really good food, like drugs of abuse. It also can get activated, subdivisions of this system, during painful stimuli and during aversive stimuli, which, again, are really important for you to be aware of, to say, oh my God, that's really bad for me. So the dopamine system, this reward circuitry and its subcomponents that maybe, perhaps signal more salience or aversion in the environment, are closely tied to arousal systems and memory systems. Again, hopefully, for somewhat obvious reasons, you want to remember powerfully reinforcing events in your life, as well as powerfully emotionally or physically painful events in your life. So I hope I answered your question to a modest degree. Andrew Huberman: No, far better than a modest degree. That's an excellent description of the dopamine system from a true expert. And the question I have is about some of the context and nuance of the system, but in sort of real world terms, how should I think about this? Even in my training as a neuroscientist, I know neurons can be a little active, a lot active, everything in between. They can be active over long periods of time or short periods of time. But let's use the example of the donut. I like a glazed old fashioned donut. I actually don't have a craving for sweet thIngs, but donuts is an exception. I like the glazed old fashioned donut, but if I were to see just a little piece of a glazed old fashioned donut versus a full glazed old fashioned donut, could I expect that more dopamine is released to the anticipation of the complete donut? And then the other question is, how does context influence the dopamine system? For instance, if I'm very full, a glazed old fashioned donut might be aversive to me. Whereas if I'm just a little bit hungry, or if I'm actually more on a schedule of rewarding myself for abstaining from sweet, fatty foods, then abstaining from the food might be its own form of reward. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: And so, to me, the dopamine system seems incredibly simple and yet incredibly prone to immediate context and the kinds of nuance that we're constantly juggling. I'll interrupt myself to say that we're constantly juggling a bunch of different reward contingencies. We want to have good health metrics and maybe have a certain aesthetic qualities to our body, but we also want the doughnut. And so how does a system as simple as one neuromodulator system and the VTA to nucleus accumbens, and with some connections to the memory area, how does it balance all of that information in real time? To me, that's just, like, staggeringly complex, but also incredibly interesting. Robert Malenka: I think you,,, beautifully put, very eloquent description. You just said it. It's staggeringly simple, simultaneously staggeringly complex. And you asked several different questions. So context makes an enormous importance. And that's one of the reasons I became interested in the dopamine reward circuitry is, as you know, as a colleague in the academic neuroscience world, but your listeners probably don't, I started out my career studying very basic mechanisms of plasticity. How does the brain modify itself? And what makes the brain different than the computer hardware is the physical connections in the brain are constantly changing the strength of the communication. Similarly for the dopamine reward circuitry, it's highly plastic and it's highly contextually dependent. And so you gave the example of donuts and feeding, and I'll answer your question about the cues. Yes, I used to give the example of Thanksgiving, so let me give that example. In the morning of Thanksgiving, all, for most of us in the United States, the morning of Thanksgiving, if you're at home visiting your parents, the smells of the apple pie, the smells of the turkey cooking are highly repetitive, highly reinforcing. You're anticipating that fun event. You're anticipating Uncle Joe coming to visit you for Thanksgiving. And that's all because these cues, the smells, the anticipation of Uncle Joe, your previous experiences, are part of your memory system, sort of talking to, in a simple way, your reward circuitry. So you're building up this anticipation, one could almost say this craving, which maybe we'll talk about in the context of addiction. And then, make a long story short, think about that evening at the end of Thanksgiving. Those exact same cues, the exact same smell of the apple pie, turkey, and Uncle Joe himself. At the very least, they're no longer repetitive, meaning they might actually be aversive. The last thing you want is a piece of apple pie. You can't wait for Uncle Joe to leave your Thanksgiving dinner. And I always argue that does not happen magically. That happens because your brain has been modified by the context in which it sits. And this very important modulatory system, this reward circuitry, is responding to the exact same stimuli with a very different response. So I'm just telling you, I'm repeating what you said, the phenomenology. And again, my other favorite example is any of us who have been in an intimate relationship knows that the love of your life can turn to the bane of your existence in 20 seconds. And again, that doesn't happen magically. This person who you crave, who you love, does something, and two minutes later, your brain is saying, oh, my God, I may have to break up with this person, or, this is an incredibly painful emotional experience, and what fascinates me about the brain is, how does the brain mediate that rapid change? So now back to, so, yes, context is everything about how this powerful neuromodule choice system that uses dopamine works, and the truth is, we don't know. It's because the inputs onto these dopamine neurons, the other nerve cells that are driving the activity of the dopamine neurons, and I've actually studied this in my lab at Stanford University with a colleague you know well, Lee Chun Luo, who's a world class neuroscientist. We've studied the complexity of the neuroanatomy of the dopamine system, and these dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, the source of the reward circuitry, dopamine, are receiving inputs from all over the brain. They're receiving indirectly or directly inputs from visual areas, from somatosensory areas. And I'm not giving you a really good answer because that's one of the goals of my research, to try to understand how context, how the history that you've had with these cues, which we're going to get back to of the donut or of a drug, how has that modified how this neuromodulatory system responds? Similarly, the nucleus accumbens, the target of this powerful modulator, dopamine, is receiving communications, what we call inputs from all sorts of brain regions that you know about. Andrew, your audience may not. It receives inputs from an area called the hippocampus, which you may have covered in previous podcasts, which is very powerfully, very important for memories, both establishing new memories and, again, remember, that makes sense. You want this system, this dopamine reward circuitry, to be very connected to memory systems. So the activity in the nucleus accumbens is modulated by dopamine while it is receiving information from the hippocampus, which helps encode new memories, while it's receiving information from a brain area called the amygdala, which is a part of the brain involved in our emotional experiences. The accumbens also receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex, which is this brain area. As you know better than me, Andrew, is important for decision making, for planning our activity, and I could go on and on. Andrew Huberman: Well, could we talk about prefrontal cortex for a moment, because it always was surprising to me that prefrontal cortex is talked about as this higher executive function area. But then when you look at the neuroanatomy, it's, as we say, monosynaptically, as you and I know, one connection away from structures like the amygdala, one connection away from structures like the nucleus accumbens . In other words, prefrontal cortex, to me, is every bit as ancient as some of these other structures that we think of as more ancient, and really, the whole ancient evolved thing gets a little bit dicey because certain areas aren't like the prefrontal cortex, are more elaborated in humans. But to me, the prefrontal cortex seems to be especially important in the context of this thing of scaling the reward response, or context of the reward response, because it can set rules. It seems to know, okay, we're recording a podcast now, and there are certain rules, there are certain things that we're going to do and not do. But what's fascinating about the, and I'm so glad you gave a bunch of different examples, because what's fascinating, for instance, about the relationship example is that, yes, at one moment we can adore somebody, and another moment later, if they do something or don't do something, we can be incredibly frustrated with them. They can even become aversive to us. Hopefully, that doesn't happen too frequently. Robert Malenka: Hopefully. Andrew Huberman: But I think we've all had the experience of a doughnut, an event, or a person actually looking different to us from one moment to the next, hopefully not at random. And so, to me, it seems like the prefrontal cortex is uniquely positioned to really say, okay, right now we are in a mode of, for lack of a better word, love and loving, like in the verb tense of loving, be in the verb tense of arguing. We're now arguing. We're in the verb tense of reconciliation, kind of somewhere in between or something of that sort, and how a structure in a circuit as simple as the dopamine system, one molecule could suddenly say, oh, you know what? Now getting over my anger is rewarding. Whereas five minutes ago, being right and being the most angry was rewarding, and then five minutes before that, again, we're accelerating this movie, but five minutes or five days or five years before that, this person could do no wrong, and the dopamine system is just cranking out dopamine, saying, whatever you do, I'm just delighted by it. Incredible. Like, to me, I can't think of a more interesting system in neuroscience. Robert Malenka: Well, I mean, that was eloquently put. I agree with pretty much everything you said. I don't have much to add, because what you're pointing out is the challenges of studying these systems, the importance of studying these systems, and the challenge of presenting how the brain works to this podcast audience. Because on the one hand, you have done a fantastic job over the last few years in your podcast of making complex subjects accessible to a lay audience and get them to be thinking about how our modern view of how the brain works could be used to enhance health, could enhance mental well being. But as neuroscientists, academic neuroscientists ourselves, we know, you know, you are oversimplifying things, and the actual functioning of a system like the dopamine reward circuitry, as you just eloquently pointed out, is so much more complex. It's modified by these prefrontal inputs, which are simultaneously telling our memory systems, pay attention here. I'm repeating what you just said. The context makes a big difference, the history you have with the person or stimuli with whom you're interacting. Like to bring this back to your which I never - the initial question - does a small piece of a doughnut activate the cue that, that small piece of a donut activate the reward circuitry and cause release of dopamine to the same extent as the full donut? Depends on your experience with donuts. I think for you and me, because we seem to both like donuts, they're highly repetitive for us, probably doesn't matter, because we have learned even a little piece of a doughnut activates all of our memory system, saying, man, that's an old fashioned glazed donut. I want to eat that. I want to get one, or I want to have the discipline not to eat it. So I hope I'm answering your question, and I'm shifting topics completely. But that's why addiction is so challenging. Well, let's talk about that. Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about that, because you've done a ton of important work in this area of addiction. I mean, one of the basic questions I have about addiction know we hear that certain drugs are more addicting than other drugs or certain behaviors. We also hear that we can become addicted to anything. When Anna Lemke was on this podcast, I said, what's the most unusual addiction you've ever seen? And she talked about a patient who sadly committed suicide at some point later that she told us had been addicted to water, to drinking of any kind, first alcohol, but then water eventually. So my question about addiction in the dopamine system is, let's pick a drug like cocaine. I've never done cocaine, but people who have done cocaine tell me that it feels very good. And one of the more salient features of the cocaine high is that it comes on very fast, and it ends pretty quickly, too. Is the rate of dopamine increase related to the addictive property of a drug or behavior as much as how much dopamine is released? Robert Malenka: And that's a very sophisticated question, and the answer is yes. And that's usually the lecture I give, the way I think about addiction, and obviously my friend and colleague Anna Lemke is one of the world's experts in terms of the understanding the human experience of addiction. I have studied it as a cellular molecular neuroscientist trying to understand how addictive substances modify reward circuitry, modify the connections in the reward circuitry, modify how dopamine neurons act, and the way, like any, what appears to be a simple term, it's layered with complexity. Addiction is somewhat of a continuum. And I like to think about whether you're talking about substances like cocaine, and I will explicitly answer your question soon, or opioids. As you know, we're going in this country, there is an opioid epidemic. I do like to think about addictive liability, and in my view, it is pretty clear that when we're talking about drugs, they have different degrees of addictive liability. I mean, I had a cup of coffee this morning, and many of us listening to this podcast, it's really hard to start our day without getting that hit of caffeine. But are we addicted to caffeine? That's a tricky question, because I've never heard of anybody robbing a bank to get caffeine, destroying their personal life to get caffeine. So I would say caffeine causes tolerance, but I would not say it has a particularly high addictive liability, whereas drugs like psychosimulants, like cocaine or opioids, have a very high addictive liability. So, to answer your mechanistic question, there have been some famous studies done by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Nora Volkow. Simultaneously, there have been studies in animal models of addiction where you nailed it. In a rough way, the addictive liability of a substance is directly correlated with two aspects of dopamine. How much dopamine is released in the accumbens and the kinetics of the dopamine release. As you said, how rapidly it's released. To get a little technical, even with a drug like cocaine or opioids, it's not only the drug itself, it's the route of administration, because the root of administration influences the kinetics, meaning how fast that drug gets into your brain influences the reward circuitry and how fast it causes a big, rapid release of dopamine. And some of your podcast listeners may be old enough to remember the crack cocaine epidemic or free base cocaine. And cocaine does have, like methamphetamine, a very high addictive liability. I give lectures to students at Stanford about neurobiology of addiction as part of a team taught course. I have kids who I had to deal with, and what I always say is, it's not that if you use this drug, you're automatically going to become an addict, but you're taking that risk. And it is impossible to become addicted to a substance if you've never used it, by definition, but back to the root of administration. So I went off-- Andrew Huberman: --That's actually an interesting statement, because I think we may have heard that in high school, although I, to be honest, wasn't the most attentive high school student, and I regret that high school students, pay attention! Robert Malenka: You did okay for yourself. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: Eventually I came around, but it was an uphill battle. But that you can't become addicted to something that you've never done, which I just want to earmark that because I think it's a profound statement, because it points to the importance of the memory system, but also plasticity. And so I want to make sure that eventually we get around to talking about how the amount of dopamine released and the kinetics, how that might influence plasticity. Robert Malenka: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: What I'm asking here, queuing up in the back of your mind, is whether or not addiction is just related to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior, or when we are under the influence of a drug, or whether or not it actually modifies neural circuitry in a way that makes a broader range of drugs or experiences attractive to us. Robert Malenka: It's probably the latter, but. So let me get back, and I will answer that in a second to the point I was making. So it's not only the substance, it's the route of administration. As I said, you can't develop a problem with a substance and develop a substance abuse problem if you never take it. But snorting cocaine is a different experience than smoking it or injecting it. And one of the reasons the crack cocaine epidemic was so powerful, is it gets into when you're smoking it or injecting it. And people do this now with methamphetamine, I mean, meth addicts, most of them. And that is another epidemic in our country. Most of them smoke it. And the danger of that is the drug, whether it's cocaine, methamphetamine, gets into your brain almost instantaneously, causes a very rapid, powerful surge of dopamine in the accumbens in this reward circuitry. And that the feeling you get, which, and we're going to get into this, is not necessarily a happy feeling, and it can last for tens of seconds or a few minutes, and it's a feeling that gives you this overwhelming compulsion and urge, I want to do it again. Even though it may not actually feel all that good, and again, this gets into we didn't have an addiction problem for any substance other than alcohol, for most of humanity's existence, because these substances like cocaine, methamphetamine, synthetic opioids like fentanyl, they didn't exist. And the truth is, our brains are not designed to handle those kinds of very powerful substances. Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day. But oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1 , I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1 . I have more focus and energy and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1 , go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of Vitamin D3K2 again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman . Robert Malenka: So, where do you want to go from here? You asked a question about the neural mechanisms of what we call addiction. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd like to know about the role of neuroplasticity and addiction. I do want to highlight something you said, and I apologize for interrupting a moment ago. And then I refrained, but it was an interruption based on real excitement because a person I know quite well, who is a recovered cocaine addict, told me. And that, by the way, folks, this isn't, I have a friend and I'm actually, you know... I truly have never tried cocaine. And this person said that the first time they did cocaine, his thought was, I hate this, and I can't wait to do it again. And that's exactly how you described it. Robert Malenka: And I think that is a fairly common experience with people suffering from an addiction disorder. We're not supposed to use the word addicts anymore because that's a little bit judgmental. Andrew Huberman: That's the new nomenclature. Robert Malenka: Something along those lines. Andrew Huberman: Got it. Calling someone an addict as opposed to being addicted. Robert Malenka: Yeah, being. And that is a beautiful description. I hate it, but I want to do it again and again. It just shows the power of this system, which, remember, evolved for our survival. So a very simple way of thinking about it is these drugs are tricking the reward circuitry to say, this stimulus, this experience, is really important for my survival. I have to go do it again and again and again. A side question is, the huge question is, why do some people develop an addiction problem and others who have used this substance just don't? And again, as a world class neuroscientist yourself, you know the answer. It's always a complex combination of underlying genetics, the environment in which they find themselves, the environment in which they grew up, and how that modified their reward circuitry. So, to get at your question, one set of experiments my lab did, which other labs did, too, I don't deserve the sole credit for this, is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity in the neurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry. And in fact, drugs of abuse, like cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids like morphine, heroin, change the synapses. The synapses are the connections from other nerve cells onto dopamine neurons, onto the nerve cells and the accumbens. And these connections, these synapses, can change. And drugs of abuse cause powerful changes in those connections, and therefore, powerful changes in the activity of the dopamine neurons and the neurons in the nucleus accumbens. And, in fact, the types of changes that occur appear to be similar to the types of changes that have evolved for good uses for adaptive forms of learning and memory. So, again, this is an example that this superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry is changing all the time, and it's highly plastic and can become more sensitive to certain experiences, etc, etc. Andrew Huberman: Well, could I ask a question about some of the general contours of the plasticity and the dopamine system? You said before, and I love this statement, even though it's very simple, but in its simplicity, it's really elegant that we can't become addicted to a substance or a behavior that we haven't taken or partaken in. So is there data to support the idea that just one exposure to cocaine or one exposure to some sort of behavior can lead to a lasting change in the dopamine system, such that one's propensity to be addicted to that substance again, if one were to indulge in the future, or behavior again in the future, is increased? And I have a very particular reason for asking this, but I'm very curious what the answer is. Robert Malenka: I mean, in the work my lab and other labs have done in preclinical rodent models, the answer is yes. A single administration of a drug of abuse, like cocaine, like morphine, can cause relatively several days, several weeks of changes in the connections onto dopamine neurons and onto the neurons in the nucleus accumbens those changes. That does not mean these changes are permanent or irreversible, but the changes last a long time. And again, the big question for understanding the neurobiology of addiction is, those changes are probably happening in most people who take the drug. In this case, and we can talk about other stimuli, non drug stimuli that can become "addictive." Again, why in certain individuals? To be honest, it's not a big deal. Yeah, I did cocaine at this party. It was nice, but I don't feel any craving or urge to do it again. Whereas other individuals, it sets them down a very bad path and really badly affects their life. And that's a huge question in the research field, because obviously, if we could make predictions on which individuals are more susceptible, and not to get too political here, but whether you become, develop a problem with addiction, or not is influenced by the other parts of your life. Do you have other ways of getting, reinforcing stimuli, getting satisfaction, having an outlet, that other ways of activating your reward or dopamine circuitry? Healthy ways, right? Like, as you have articulated, I think, in your podcast, getting exercise. You and I both like to get exercise. I feel really good. Sometimes it's painful during the exercise, but afterwards I feel great. Andrew Huberman: Almost the inverse of the cocaine response. Robert Malenka: Yeah, the desire. Andrew Huberman: And then I hate this, but I can't wait to do it again. It seems like exercise is often the opposite. I hate this, I don't want to do this. And then afterwards, gosh, I always feel better and I'd be happy to do it again. Robert Malenka: Yes, I like to exercise chasing a ball, because that gets me off thinking about this hurts anyhow, back to addiction. So, yes, these drugs can cause, I don't want to, definitely not permanent, changes from a single exposure. And the types of studies I'm talking about were all done in experimental animals. So how that relates to what happens in our brains, in human subjects brains is not completely clear, but I think there are parallels. So the changes might last a few days, a week or two, but one can see if somebody, there have been studies done where, in an animal model, if you give repeated administration of a drug like cocaine, the changes get stronger and they last longer, which is kind of intuitively obvious. But again, the big question is why, in human subjects, there are people who can use these substances and not develop a serious problem, and there are others where they're very damaging. And then that's why I still make the point. If you're a young person, do you want to take that risk? Is it worth it to have that experience? And that's an individual decision. Andrew Huberman: We've done some podcast episodes about alcohol, cannabis, etc. , and there just seem to be a pretty wide variation in people's response to the information, I think because there are people out there who, well, I've got friends who are recovered alcoholics who will tell me the first drink they took, they use language like it combined with the chemistry of my body in a way that nothing before ever had. And they felt like it was like this magic elixir, right? That has not been my experience. Robert Malenka: I have heard the same stories, and it's hard for me to relate, because, like you, alcohol does not have that effect on me. And it's hard to believe that kind of immediate response to alcohol is due to the environment in which they grew up, although that can have an influence that just feels almost more genetically encoded. And there is evidence that issues with the use of alcohol and developing alcohol use disorder does run in families. And obviously, if it runs in family, you have to worry about how the environment of that family influences it. But there's a lot of studies saying there is a genetic component. Maybe, like you, if I have a drink or two in the afternoon, I just fall asleep, and it does not have that effect on me. And anyone can imagine similar things for other drugs of abuse. There are people who have used cocaine, have used methamphetamine, who find it modestly enjoyable, but it's not the be all or end all, isn't this incredibly powerful experience. And you just talked about, I think, a friend or a colleague who said, I hate it. I hate that, but I want to do it again. And that's fascinating. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're now a recovered alcoholic and cocaine addict, and they've abstained for many years, but still get a little bit of a gleam in their eye when they talk about alcohol or cocaine in a way that I just can't relate to. Robert Malenka: Can I tell you a little vignette about me? Which I love to tell. Andrew Huberman: Sure. Robert Malenka: And it gets into how the reward circuitry is so closely associated with memory systems and how cues associate it with powerful experiences, develop their own reinforcing or aversive quality. So, long story short, when I was a young kid, I can't remember in my 20s, maybe 20, I spent a few weeks in Paris, I started smoking cigarettes. I mean, this is a long time ago, and cigarettes are very interesting. Nicotine is highly addictive, as the tobacco companies were fully aware of. Andrew Huberman: High addictive liability. Robert Malenka: Very high addictive liability. Andrew Huberman: People will rob people for the money to buy cigarettes. Robert Malenka: They may not rob because, although my understanding is they've become quite expensive, but counterfeit cigarettes are a huge market for organized crime. There are parts in the world, third World countries, where organized crime produce counterfeit cigarettes and are making hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. I think nicotine as it is delivered in cigarettes, as you know, I mean, tobacco companies put in a lot of work to figure out the exact dose of nicotine that will make you get that kind of feeling that only lasts for a few minutes, so you want to do it again and again. So we can talk about nicotine. What becomes a problem in a specific society with addiction is not only based on the neurobiological actions. If we're talking still about drugs or substances of that substance, it's heavily influenced by the availability of the substance. But my little story is, I smoked some cigarettes in Paris. I learned why people like to smoke. It was very satisfying to have a cigarette in a Parisian cafe. And it's very interesting because the first few times you inhale tobacco, you get dizzy. It's kind of aversive, and it's exactly what you articulated. Despite that, you want to do it again. So it was just a lot of fun for me. I enjoyed it, and I was disciplined. At some point, whenever this was, I came back to the United States. I didn't smoke because I knew it was bad for you. But to this day, 40 years later, every time I go back to Paris, I get cravings. I actually just want to get a pack of cigarettes. I want to have that feeling again of inhaling the smoke. But the point is of how powerful these rewarding experiences can be, or reinforcing experiences. And for your audience, technically, what I have been taught by some of my psychology colleagues is we use the term reinforcing in a very behaviorally defined way. Something is reinforcing is if the behavior that led to that stimuli, it makes you want to do that behavior. Again, rewarding means it actually felt "good." Andrew Huberman: That's an important distinction. Robert Malenka: They actually can be different. Again, as you defined by your friend who his, I forget, I think it was cocaine. Cocaine was highly reinforcing, but it was not necessarily enjoyable or rewarding. And isn't that fascinating? I have some colleagues in the addiction field. One of them is retired now, Kent Barridge and Terry Robinson. They distinguish between the terms wanting and liking. And think about that. Liking something means it's something you like, you enjoy. Wanting means you want it, but you don't necessarily like it or enjoy it. And that's a description of your friend's experience with cocaine. Some of us have been in destructive relationships where you want that individual, but you're not sure you necessarily like that individual. Andrew Huberman: Sometimes people will be in relationships where they actively dislike the other person, which is a bit foreign of a concept to me, but, well, it's interesting. This separation of reinforcing and rewarding wanting and liking, because one of the things that's very prominent in twelve step programs is to create rewards around abstaining from the drug or behavior. And I should mention that programs like twelve step, when followed, seem to have very high success rates. At least that's what Ana Lemke tells me, that in some ways they are modifying the wanting and liking. They're splitting the wanting and liking of alcohol, for instance, creating a liking of sobriety more than the wanting of alcohol, for instance. Robert Malenka: That's beautifully put. And I think that's right. How that plays out in the neural mechanisms that, as a neuroscientist, I'm interested. Man, that's a tough one, but I think that's why those programs are pretty successful. It's helping the person make those dissociations. And I don't know that much about those programs because I have not seen patients myself for whatever it's been, 27, 28 years. But I think part of them are to help that individual find, both other sources of liking and reward, getting some satisfaction and reward from the actual abstinence, being able to cognitively teach themselves that I deserve a pat on the back. I deserve credit. I feel good that I did not take a drink at that party that I did not use that substance again. And how that plays out in our brains is a really tough one. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, the way you described it is exactly right. Those programs are highly reinforcing for abstinence behaviors, everything from the social connection, which we're going to get to social connection, as you know, to the way that people start to conceptualize their addict self versus other self. It actually involves a splitting of the self in interesting ways. As long as we're talking about donuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine. I'm curious, before we move to a bit more on neuroplasticity, is there anything that people ought to know about how different substances and behaviors that are addicting might impact the dopamine reward circuitry differently? So, for instance, we talked about cocaine as having this very rapid onset, big increase in dopamine, then a crash, as we know, a certain pattern of kinetics, as you describe it, the opioid crisis is incredibly serious problem right now, as is methamphetamine. But it sounds like methamphetamine functions a bit like cocaine. And in terms of its kinetics, yes. So an opioid is a very different chemical than cocaine, but it sounds like it impacts the dopamine system. Is the dopaminergic activity caused by opioids responsible for the addictive properties of opioids? Or do people also like the feeling of being under opioids? I personally hate it coming out of surgery. Like, they gave me Vicodin once and I hated it. I'd rather have the pain, the postoperative pain, than take something like Vicodin or a Valium or fentanyl or anything like that, to me, is just completely aversive. But I realize that there are many millions of people that feel quite differently. Robert Malenka: It's a great question. So I think all the studies, both in human beings and preclinical animal models, yes, would suggest that the addictive liability of opioids and psychostimulants, which are cocaine and methamphetamine, have the common final action of causing massive release of dopamine in this target of the dopamine neurons, the nucleus accumbens. They do it, if we want to get a little scientifically technical here, via very different mechanisms. So cocaine and methamphetamine, what the drugs known as psychostimulants, actually bind to a protein in the brain, or a molecule in the brain that is responsible for sucking up. It's a vacuum cleaner sucking up the dopamine after it's been released. And cocaine prevents that dopamine from being vacuumed up. So the cocaine hangs around longer. Meth not only prevents the dopamine from being vacuumed up, it actually causes the reverse. It actually causes the direct release of dopamine from what we call nerve terminals, from the site where dopamine is released. Opioids work very differently. They actually primarily, not solely work where the dopamine neurons live. And it's a little complicated, it's not that critical, but they indirectly increase the activity within the dopamine neurons themselves, causing a big, massive, bigger than normal release of dopamine. So that's one commonality. But anybody who has used these drugs or read about these drugs, the subjective experience of the drugs are dramatically different, and that's because of the actions they're having, not only in the reward circuitry, but throughout the brain. And it's interesting, you talked about Vicodin. I've taken Vicodin because I've had several knee surgeries and things. Like you, I didn't like it. I've gotten other opioids for pain relief that were great. I mean, they took away a lot of pain after my ligament repair. And that's a different question, that even when you're talking about opioids, all drugs, they're not identical. Fentanyl has a much big, larger addictive liability because of its molecular properties and how it's interacting with the opioid system in our brains and the receptors, the actual proteins in the brain that it interacts with. But the subjective experience of opioids, it's interesting. Some people love it. If we go back in history, as you know, there were the opium dens throughout Asia. There were wars about opioids, the famous opioid wars between China and the United Kingdom, showing you how powerful the availability of a substance like an opioid can be. So I'm going off on a tangent. Andrew Huberman: No, I think these are important. Robert Malenka: But commonality is dopamine release in the, if you remember what a ven diagram is, these drugs have some common actions, usually on, directly or indirectly, causing the massive release of dopamine in the accumbens. But then they have their own individual actions, because obviously, when you take cocaine or methamphetamine, it's a stimulator. People are grinding their teeth, they're hyped up. For most people, opioids are the exact opposite in opium dens. From the movies I watched and watching narcos and all those TV shows, you're lying down, you're kind of in almost a dreamlike state. So very different subjective experiences. Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors, which is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. LMNT contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, and certainly I drink LMNT in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of sweating. If you'd like to try LMNT , you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman. Yeah, I had an experience with an opioid recently, not voluntarily. Over the Christmas holiday, we went to visit friends, and before going to sleep, I wanted some tea, and I asked if they had any non-caffeinated tea. So they gave me this tea. And that night I had the most bizarre dreams I've ever had. And I slept for 14 hours. The next morning, I was like, what was that tea? And I felt off in the morning. And it was actually a blue lotus flower tea that is actually illegal in the United States, but it is sold and it has morphine like compounds in it. And I am one of those people that's very susceptible to even low doses of any kind of novel drug. Robert Malenka: Interesting. Have you ever taken cough syrup with dextromethorphan? Andrew Huberman: No, I avoid that stuff. Robert Malenka: Well, I have a tendency when I get a cold, it gets into my lungs. I cough a lot. And I think this has been reported. This is my anecdotal experience. I'm confirming what you said. Dextromethorphan is a different sort of opioid. And actually, some people develop a problem with it, for me, it gives me really bizarre dreams. Really similar to what you were describing. Andrew Huberman: It was very unusual. Robert Malenka: And that's a whole different conversation about what makes us dream and what are the meaning of dreams. Fascinating. I hope you covered. Maybe you've covered that. Andrew Huberman: We have. Not yet, but we are intending to do a whole series on sleep and dreaming, and we'll definitely get into it. Robert Malenka: I started out in sleep research, so I have a fondness for it. Andrew Huberman: Well, drug research and sleep research have a long history of overlap with Alan Hobson's work on-- Robert Malenka: --I worked with Alan Hobson. Andrew Huberman: Okay, by the way, folks, if you're interested in the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming, Alan Hobson is a good name to start your rabbit hole. Robert Malenka: Oh, my God. I'm dating myself. I can't remember if it was '76 or '77, I worked with Alan Hobson as an u ndergraduate-- -- At Harvard Medical School-- --No, as an undergraduate at Harvard. He was at Harvard Medical School. Yeah. Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I love his writing, and I learned a lot from it. He was really ahead of his time. Robert Malenka: Yes, he was. Anybody who knows me won't believe this, but back then, I was a very shy, insecure 20 year old-- Andrew Huberman: --I would not have guessed-- Robert Malenka: --who, even in medical school, I literally was not confident of my opinions at all. I was very shy, thought all of the ideas I had must be obvious that I should never say them out loud. Andrew Huberman: Do you mind if I ask, since you raised this, I think it's really important. I mean, you have this incredible career track record. You're adored by your colleagues, you're highly respected, you've won just about every award there is to winning neuroscience. So was there something in particular that, was it an overnight thing where one day you woke up and thought, I actually believe in myself? But if you wouldn't mind sharing that, because I think before we get back into some of the science. Science is a human endeavor, and most people listening are probably not scientists, but I think everybody deals with these issues of self-doubt, and people appear to have varying levels of confidence. But what happened? Robert Malenka: Thank you for asking. For me, it was a very gradual process. And as an undergraduate, as a medical student, even as a postdoc, yeah, I was very unsure of my ideas, of my intellectual abilities, of whether what I was thinking was really worthwhile. So it was a very gradual process, I think. The increase in my confidence, I think, began when I was a postdoc, which is a training period after you've received a PhD or an MD, where you get additional research training. And I worked with a guy named Roger Nicoll at UCSF, and Roger was a very intellectually intense, very forceful individual. And I got involved in a field where, I mean, people, a little bit of a tangent, your listeners may think that scientists are these geeky individuals wearing white coats with no passion or emotion, and nothing could be further from the truth. The most successful scientists I know are pretty passionate and pretty intense about what they're working on and driven. And this is a gross generalization. So, anyhow, during my postdoc, I started getting involved in a topic where there were vigorous arguments about phenomenology we were studying. So I had to develop a tougher and thicker skin. I had to be able to argue my side of the hypotheses we were generating. So it started developing as a postdoc, and then it slowly evolved. As an assistant professor, and for your listeners who don't know, I don't like to admit this, but I'm in my late sixties. I have been running my own lab for almost 40 years. So gradually, as an assistant professor, I realized, hey, I can do this. I can do science. I can write papers that my colleagues seem to be interested in. And then gradually, over then the next 10, 20, 30 years, I gained more and more confidence. So for me, it was this very gradual build up of many different experiences where I developed some confidence that not all of my ideas are great, of course they're not, but it's okay to voice my opinion. It's okay to state my ideas and why I believe this and why I don't believe that. So that was my experience. Andrew Huberman: Thank you for sharing that, because I think people struggle with that very issue. And clearly, showing up again and again over a long period of time is helpful. But as you said, learning to trust one's ideas, just a brief anecdote when I was coming up in neuroscience, a few years behind you, 20 years behind me, not too many decades. But I recall the incredible number of high profile papers on neuroplasticity and long term potentiation, long term depression. These are terms related to the modification of synapses that Rob Malenka and Roger Nicoll pioneered. A big segment of that work. And I remember seeing your names on papers, and I thought Roger worked for you. Sorry, Roger. [LAUGHS] Robert Malenka: I love to hear that. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: I was under the impression he worked for you. And only later did I learn that you were his postdoc. Robert Malenka: And then we collaborated as equals. Andrew Huberman: You became peers very quickly. Robert Malenka: Very quickly. Andrew Huberman: Roger's wonderful. Robert Malenka: I did have the confidence, even as a postdoc, actually, even as a grad student, even though I was a little insecure about my ideas. I wanted to be treated as an equal. That's the one thing I did have. I never felt that I was working for somebody else. I always felt that I was working for myself and that we were colleagues, even though my mentors had more experience and I could learn from them. Andrew Huberman: I like that you're working for yourself even though you have mentors. I think there's some real gems in what you just described. So thank you for taking the time to do that. Robert Malenka: Sure. Andrew Huberman: I'd like to discuss one aspect of reward circuitry that I don't think most people think about. It's fairly straightforward nowadays. I like to think more people know what dopamine is and understand it, thanks to your work and Anna's work and some discussions that have taken place on our podcast and other podcasts. But all too often we think dopamine, reward, wanting, liking drugs. Okay, all of that is great, but what about the truly adaptive stuff, right? Because it's easy to fall into a discussion around dopamine of the things that are bad for us. But what I'm thinking about here is social interaction. Clearly, we are a social species, and a lot of your work in the last decade and a half or so has focused on the relationship between the reward circuitry, which you beautifully described for us, and social interaction and connection. And where I'm going with this is ultimately, this has huge implications for autism and autism spectrum disorders. I don't know if, nowadays, is it okay? You're not supposed to call autism a disease, is that right? You hear about neurotypical and neuro atypical, but I have friends who have children who are severely autistic. And I don't know many parents who would elect to have a severely autistic kid. And so those people often will talk about it as autism or a child having autism. So first of all, before we get into the social piece, maybe because I just tabled it, how are we supposed to talk about autism nowadays? Robert Malenka: I am very interested in the pathophysiology of what the medical profession terms autism spectrum disorder. As you pointed out, individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder are quite heterogeneous, and it can range from individuals with severe intellectual impairment and quite severe impairments in social interactions, impairments in sensory processing, impairments in lots of different aspects of our behaviors that are important. And I think nobody would say, would argue, those individuals on the severe spectrum do not have some sort of "disorder." The issue we have to be sensitive to is it's a heterogeneous disorder. Like many brain issues that psychiatrists deal with, like depression, like obsessive compulsive disorder, like various anxiety disorders, it's always on a continuum and a spectrum. So for autism spectrum disorder, there are individuals who are high functioning who, one could argue, have a different style of interacting socially, may have a different way of processing sensory information, but who would prefer not to be viewed as having an illness, but rather would be viewed as having a different style of living and interaction. And I think we need to respect that. So the challenge is, again, not oversimplifying a complex heterogeneous disorder and both being respectful of the people who don't want to be defined as having a neuropsychiatric or brain disorder, while equally being respectful of people like your friends with severely impaired children who deserve help, who deserve research. And it's a tough one, because my understanding from, to be honest, just reading articles in the lay press and going to websites from organizations that philanthropically support research related to autism, within that community of individuals who are not researchers, but who have family members or are themselves dealing with some degree of autism spectrum disorder, there's disagreements about what terminology to use, how to deal with them, and it's complicated. I think we just have to respect everybody. And if you're interacting with individuals, I think it's appropriate. What do you prefer? I do know as a medical professional, and especially when you're dealing with children, there are children who need help and we're not doing them a service by saying they don't have an issue that we should be helping them with and working on. So I hope that answers your question beautifully. Andrew Huberman: I think it beautifully answers it and encompasses all sides so that we can move forward. So as we use the term autism or children or people with autism, that's what we're referring to. Robert Malenka: I think people are very sensitive, especially those individuals who are neuro atypical, who previously might be diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder, but would prefer to not be labeled as having a brain illness. That's fine. Once you are an adult, you can make that decision for yourself. Andrew Huberman: We certainly have colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere who, at least by my non clinical assessment, seem to fall somewhere on that spectrum. Robert Malenka: And again, it's a continuum. Just as the experience of depression is a continuum. Andrew Huberman: As with depression, you wouldn't love a child or an adult any less because they have depression, nor would you love a child or an adult any less because of expression of some autism. Robert Malenka: I know the point, we are being trained in the medical profession to be very, and our society is going this way too, very careful with the terms we use and the labeling of individuals. So I've been taught you can say individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder. Some people don't like using the term, oh, that individual is autistic, because that can have some, I don't want to say derogatory meaning, but some labeling kind of. But sometimes this gets out of control, too, as we both know. Andrew Huberman: Well, for sake of fluid conversation, we will do our best, but we will acknowledge from the outset that we are well meaning but far from perfect in how we'll handle this. Robert Malenka: Well put. Well put. Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about social interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism, for the moment, it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend time with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a dog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable. We were born with the capacity to build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded. Is it rewarded through the dopamine system? And what, if any, involvement is there of the serotonergic system? And we haven't talked about serotonin yet, but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point. Maybe you could educate us a little bit about serotonin, because, gosh, if dopamine is fascinating, serotonin is at least as incredible. Robert Malenka: Yeah, great question. So I think for me, the easiest way for me to answer it is, actually just tell you, my research history and how a lab like mine at Stanford that at one point was studying what you and I would call fairly hardcore molecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity. How do connections between nerve cells change and what molecules are changing? And pretty hardcore molecular stuff. How did I end up studying social behaviors in mice? And what I hope we'll end up talking about, even developing behavioral models of what I will define as empathy in mice. The answer is very simple. My lab was working on roles of classic dopamine reward circuitry and how it changes in models of addiction. We haven't talked about depression models of depression, because just intuitively, hopefully, your listeners can understand if one component of depression is what we call anhedonia, the inability to experience reward. Eating a donut is no longer satisfying. Having sex is no longer that much fun, which is a component of depression. If there's a mechanism in the brain that tells you something is rewarding, by definition, that's not functioning normally in severe depression. So we were doing models of depression to figure out how the dopamine reward circuitry was changing, as were many other labs. We were studying addiction. Those were the obvious ones. And, I mean, it might be entertaining to your audience to learn how academic scientists think. I was thinking, those are fascinating topics. They're pretty competitive. Lots of other labs were working on it. And I started thinking what other experiences might be modifying the reward circuitry. I actually made some attempts to look at feeding behavior, but we actually never pursued that for a variety of reasons. And that's obviously important because there is an obesity epidemic in this country. And we can talk about how the reward circuitry and some of the things we've learned from our studies of addiction may be helpful to understanding obesity. But back to social interaction. I started thinking, well, for most of us, what I call a pro social, non sexual experience is highly reinforcing. Andrew, you're a pretty social guy. I'm a pretty social guy. Most of the time, I'd rather go to a movie, a sporting event, a dinner with friends. Actually, for me, the most meaningful component of my life, other than spending time with my children, is spending time with my close friends. And I started thinking, well, why is that? Why do I have such a good time going to a ball game with my best friend or going out to dinner with another couple and interacting? It's because, well, it's highly reinforcing. And if it's highly reinforcing, it must involve the reward circuitry. And then I started thinking, evolutionarily, it makes a lot of sense, because if you are part of a social species, there's a lot of advantages for your survival to be hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way. It can increase your likelihood to find a mate and reproduce. It can protect you from predators. I mean, that's why any of your listeners who ever watch wildlife shows or National Geographic shows, there's a reason all these animals hang out together. It's for protection from predators. So there are all these reasons. So, about, whenever it was, 13 or 14 years ago, my lab decided to start looking at how the reward circuitry may play a role in what I am going to call positive, pro social, nonaggressive interactions. Another word we use is just sociability. And for a variety of reasons back then, this is at least 13 years ago, maybe 15 years ago, a postdoc joined my lab named Gul Dolen. She's now a professor at Johns Hopkins, and she had an interest in oxytocin. And as your listeners know, oxytocin is this evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that's very important for parturition, having a baby born for milk being produced. And it's gotten a lot of attention as a potential love neuropeptide, as something that is released in our brains during a positive social interaction. There's a well known researcher in social behavior and bonding research called Larry Young, and he did some very important, now somewhat classic work studying a species called the vole, in particular, the prairie vole. And prairie voles are a species where they mate for life. It's called pair bonding. So one vole will find another vole. They basically get married, they have kids, and they hang out together for the rest of their life. No divorce, no 50% divorce rate. And what Larry elegantly showed in early days, in collaboration with a guy named Tom Insel, who is a famous academic psychiatrist, they showed that oxytocin action within the nucleus accumbens, within this reward circuitry, was required and really important for this monogamous pair bonding. Having said that, there was just a paper that called that into question. Andrew Huberman: But there's 30 years of research prior to that. I'm glad you brought that up, because we'll keep this contemporary. And the reality is that that recent paper got a lot of attention. Robert Malenka: You know the paper I'm talking about. Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That maybe oxytocin isn't playing as prominent role in pair bonding as people had thought. And yet, folks, that could be true. We have to be scientific about this and be open minded. But there's three decades of work that speaks to the contrary. So I think we want to weigh the evidence. Robert Malenka: Yeah, exactly. And again, the investigators who presented the work saying oxytocin may not be as important. There are limitations to the manipulations they did, which they would agree with. So I'm just telling you. So, Gul Dolen was a postdoc in my lab, and we formulated a project to look at the actions of oxytocin in the nucleus accumbens in mice. And the reason we study mice is they're what are known as genetically tractable organisms. We have all sorts of really cool and sophisticated tricks we can do to probe brain circuitry. The actions of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin in ways that we can't do in other species. And I'm going to get back to dopamine in a second. And what we found was that oxytocin action in the nucleus accumbens was indeed important for promoting sociability, probably for promoting the reinforcing component of a social interaction. And that surprised us. It was like, wow, oxytocin seems to be causing, enhancing the release of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens, and that perhaps we'll get to this. That led me off on a whole series of experiments trying to figure out how serotonin works. Studying this drug we may talk about called MDMA, which is Ecstasy, or Molly, which actually causes release of serotonin. So we did that work, and that got us working in serotonin simultaneously. There were some other papers reporting that dopamine release in the accumbens. That dopamine is released in the accumbens during a social interaction, a positive, non aggressive social interaction. Truth be told, it may also be released during an aggressive interaction. Andrew Huberman: Some people like to fight. Robert Malenka: Some people like to fight. And the difference here is the dopamine release and its role in social interactions. It's not specific only for a social interaction, as we have talked about, but nevertheless, that led my lab and other labs to do a series of papers. I'm talking about the field now showing that, and I'm giving you a lot of information here. So how might dopamine release happen during a nonaggressive social interaction? It turns out that oxytocin is not only released in the nucleus accumbens, it's released in the home of the dopamine neurons in the VTA. So, my lab and another lab from Northwestern showed that oxytocin can actually modulate dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area. So I hope I'm making sense here. I don't want to get too technical. Andrew Huberman: No, I think-- Robert Malenka: --But it just shows how we discuss these neuromodulators like dopamine. I just brought in oxytocin. We're going to talk about serotonin in a second. Unfortunately for your listeners, they don't work in isolation. They influence each other in ways that I think it's important for us to understand and elucidate. Andrew Huberman: That is not too much technical detail, and I think it's wonderfully rich with areas for us to discuss. And I'm so very glad that you brought up that neither dopamine or serotonin or oxytocin work in isolation, because all too often, and admittedly, sometimes even on my podcast, I'll talk about these things in isolation as a way to try and simplify them a bit. But there's just no way that the brain works that way. For instance, turning on dopamine and turning off serotonin, it's a weighting of inputs, and I think that serotonin, perhaps I should frame it this way. Just as often as dopamine is framed, as this reward molecule and pleasure and dopamine hits, all too often, I think, in the popular press, serotonin is discussed, and oxytocin two, for that matter, as this kind of warm, feel good, everything's mellow, not really associated with a reward and reinforcement. And of course, it's not that simple. So when it comes to social interactions, it sounds like oxytocin and serotonin are playing a prominent role also in the accumbens. And that dopamine is activated, too. Do I have that right? Okay, so I don't want to take us too far down the rabbit hole of neural circuit function, but that, to me, makes at least a brief discussion about the nucleus accumbens itself interesting. Like, okay, so I'm thinking nucleus, I know that means a pile of neurons, an aggregation of neurons. It's talking to this ventral striatum. So we got a bunch of-- Robert Malenka: --Part o f the ventral striatum, part of the subdivision. Andrew Huberman: Excuse me, I misspoke. Yeah, it's part of the ventral striatum. And the neurons there can be active and communicate with other brain areas, but we're talking about a lot of nuance of function. Robert Malenka: Oh, man, I'm smiling. I don't know if your audience can see me smiling, because I sometimes go to bed feeling it's so complicated. Oh, my God, it is. Andrew Huberman: And yet, could we say that within the nucleus accumbens, there are neurons that are acting as accelerators and brakes? Is there a simple analogy that perhaps, while not exhaustive, can still be true? Because that's always the goal on this podcast. Sure, there's no way we can be exhaustive, but we want to be as accurate as possible. Robert Malenka: So, a very influential hypothesis, which has guided my thinking. And again, the trick, you have done a wonderful job of communicating complex scientific topics to your podcast audience, and I congratulate you on that, and it's a really important role. But as you know, it's always more complicated than we want it to be as scientists, especially when you're dealing with brain activity issues and how the brain mediates all its amazing functions. So, historically, we have thought about the nucleus accumbens and other components of this ventral striatal brain area as primarily being composed of two different cell types, and as you pointed out, one being sort of an accelerator, something that promotes certain behaviors, and the other cell type somewhat being a break saying, don't do that behavior, don't perform that motor action. And it is true that there are these different cell types. It is true that they are modulated by these modulators like dopamine and serotonin in different ways. And that simplistic hypothesis, or heuristic we call it, has been very useful in making models about how the accumbens does all its wonderful things. What I'm leading up to is, unfortunately, it's a little more complicated. But yes, there are two different cell types. And at least for your audience, we can think about dopamine driving the activity of one, promoting certain behaviors and inhibiting the activity of the other cell type, and being a sort of break on certain behaviors. As long as you and I, as scientists appreciate, it's not quite that simple. It's a little more complicated. Andrew Huberman: So using that as a framework to think about social behavior, as you said, pro social, non aggressive, non sexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors, but also the suppression of a lot of behaviors. Maybe you're starting to sense what I'm doing here. I think for people to understand how a single structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward it, what it sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category and catalog of behavioral options and punishing, or at least reducing the probability of the occurrence of other behavioral actions. Because when I go to dinner with friends, if I know them really well, I might hug them. I might even say something mildly inappropriate if I know the context to be safe, right? But at a dinner interview or a discussion with somebody I barely know, I might watch my words a little bit more, for instance. Robert Malenka: And I think the accumbens and its associated circuit, I love the way you just put that... Probabilities. It's my probability of having this behavior in a certain context is increased. The probabilities of not doing certain behaviors. And I think there's little doubt that this brain area called the nucleus accumbens and all of its associated circuitry play a very important role in what behaviors you choose to do, pursue, play a very important role in these, making the decision and performing these pro social, non aggressive, non sexual interactions. I actually also think it plays a role in empathy. I'm leading you there. I want to have a discussion about that-- Andrew Huberman: --Please-- Robert Malenka: --Again, as a mechanistically driven neuroscientist, what is frustrating for me is I know a lot of the connections it's making and the other brain areas it's communicating with. But I can't give you a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens. [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: You're still going. [LAUGHS] Robert Malenka: What I can say is, even at our current level of understanding, it is leading to novel hypotheses that are allowing the development, perhaps if we bring it back to autism, that are allowing the development of novel at the moment, pharmacologic therapeutics that might be helpful for people who are not having normal pro social interactions and would like to have them, would like to be able to function in that domain in a more adaptive and productive and meaningful way. And that's the importance, in my view, of the kind of mechanistic work my lab and many other labs around the country are doing. Even if we don't have a detailed understanding of how it's all happening, we can identify drugs and druggable targets, or even behavioral interventions that might actually help people, for example, suffering from autism spectrum disorder of the sort that they actually want and need interaction, need therapeutic help. Andrew Huberman: I think looking at the social connection circuitry through the lens of autism is going to be very interesting for us to do. I do have a question about what is being selected for in rewarding social interactions, because obviously we are living in a time where we don't have to aggregate in groups, necessarily to protect ourselves physically. It helps in certain ways in certain circumstances, but certainly to support ourselves and each other emotionally. Having people that we can call on when we're not feeling so well, that we can look to for resources and that they can look to us. But when we go out to dinner with friends, or we go to a ball game with friends, or we interact with friends, I'm very familiar with the feeling of like, well, that felt really good. It just felt good. It gives me energy. It actually gives me energy to go back and do other things, like spend four days alone with a bunch of papers and lectures, preparing for a podcast, which I also really enjoy. But when I do that, when I go out to dinner with friends or see friends, I'm not thinking about buffering myself against loneliness. When I do it, I just like the interaction. So what sorts of evolutionary hypotheses can we come up with as to why the human brain is so tuned for these social interactions? Why it's rewarded by not just one, dopamine, but also serotonin and oxytocin? Three prominent neuromodulatory chemicals in the brain are devoted at one site in the brain and others that it's connected to, of course, but to making sure that we do this as often as possible without giving up the rest of our lives. Robert Malenka: Well, again, I think the answer I'm going to be able to give, I hope, it's not right, and it may be a little bit obvious, is in some ways it's analogous to why drugs of abuse and addiction are also a problem, is that the circuitry that is telling us a pro social positive interaction is so highly reinforcing, evolved over millions of years, or hundreds of thousands of years, whatever that is. And the only hypothesis I can come up with, and Andrew, you may be able to come up with better ones, is what I alluded to earlier, is that it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms, never mind non human primates, but when we were whatever we were, to be a social species for basically primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, it increased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way and for protection against predators. And there may be other reasons, probably. Andrew Huberman: Child rearing in your absence, you want trusted friends that can watch your offspring. Robert Malenka: Thank you. Very good point. So the circuits, the modulators we use, that evolved over millennia, and as you pointed out, eventually, depending on the society in which you live, you didn't need those social interactions for protection against predators. Although if we look at our world now, one can make arguments both ways. If you're in a war zone, is it better to be off by yourself? Is it better to be with a group of people? But so the mechanisms evolved for one purpose, and they don't just disappear because there's no disadvantage to having this mechanism that tells us a social interaction is reinforcing. And I would still argue there's benefit for reproductive purposes. You can't have kids if you're by yourself all the time. Well, this is actually, I think it's impossible, at least currently, and you can't find a partner with whom to have kids if you're socially isolated or it makes it much harder. So I hope I'm answering your question. And then, as you pointed out, for many of us, there's a lot of positive aspects to having friendships and hanging out with your friends. Emotional support, emotional buffering-- Andrew Huberman: --And feeling connected. There's something about feeling connected, this notion of feeling connected, and later we'll talk about psychedelics. But this notion of feeling connected has a lot to do with buffering loneliness. When we are alone, the memories and the energy, for lack of a better word, that we feel in recalling social experiences and anticipating social experiences is really powerful. You mentioned that people can't have children if they spend all their time alone. I realize you're not on social media and more power to you. But there's actually a prominent discussion on social media. There's an entire culture of young people, in particular young men these days, who, at least from what I understand in the research literature about this, are socially isolated, spending all their time online, maybe not even on social media, but are spending a lot of time online. Video games, hiding in electronic landscapes, digital landscapes, and concern about mental health issues there, etc. , concern about porn, overuse and addiction there, etc. . But social media itself is an incredible phenomenon to consider in light of everything we're talking about. Even though I am on all social media platforms and I am quite active there, I can't say that I've ever been on social media and experienced the kind of delight and thrill and persistent energy increase that I experience with in-person interaction. And yet social media, I have to assume, is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms in presumably the nucleus accumbens. So are there any data? I realize this is a hard experiment to do in mice, maybe impossible, but are there any data that you're aware of that shows that social media has a high addictive liability? Or do we even need an experiment? Robert Malenka: I'm not sure we need an experiment. I think it clearly does. I agree with the point you're making. Although your podcast audience probably doesn't know who I am. I am in my late sixties. I grew up-- Andrew Huberman: --Well, they know who you are now-- Robert Malenka: --I grew up before computers, before cell phones. So I still am a believer, perhaps in an old fashioned way, that physical interpersonal reactions are really important. Obviously there are advantages to being able to interact over social media for all sorts of reasons. There's a lot of positive and good from that. But back to your question. Can we get addicted? I can't speak to social media. I can speak, and Anna Lemki, I think, is much more able to eloquently describe the issues around this. I can just talk from my own experience that my cell phone is and check, you know, this isn't social media, but checking my email messages, checking my texting, my text messages for me has a compulsive, addictive quality, like a lever press. It's like a lever press for a mouse. And part of that is my own personality. Part of that is the immediate feedback. So you get from a social media post, from seeing your name mentioned, getting a message from one of your friends. Sure, I like getting messages from my friends. It means they're thinking about me. It means I'm part of their world. I have no doubt it's activating my reward circuitry, not nearly to the degree that a hit of cocaine or an opioid would do. I don't know what else to say about it. I think as a society, we have to be aware of these issues, and it's really complicated how we manage, especially once you're an adult, you make your own decisions, for better or worse. But it's a huge issue, obviously, for anybody who has children or is planning to have children and adults. Andrew Huberman: On social media, I see lots of accounts of people that are 18 and older who spend a lot of time on there. And I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing. A lot of people have entire careers that exist on social media. It just seems to me that Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter have capitalized on this hardwired circuitry. I mean, to make it really reductionist, the release of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin by virtue of someone saying something to us, maybe not even a positive thing, maybe it's a negative thing. As you said, they're thinking of us. There's something about being recognized by others. And maybe this is a good segue. We're heading towards empathy here. A discussion about empathy. Robert Malenka: I think that's very well put. It is capitalizing on these more primitive neurobiological mechanisms that evolved for purposes of reproduction and survival. I think that certainly has to be the case. And I think it's important. I mean, thank you for bringing that up for us as a society, to be at least aware of this. And it's like many things, it's not all good, it's not all bad. There are positive uses of social media, I can see, but mostly we read about the dangers of it. We read about these kids who are socially isolated, who make bad decisions based on what they're seeing with social media. But anyhow, back to the neuroscience. You're absolutely correct. It's capitalizing on these mechanisms that evolved for physical interpersonal interactions because our evolution didn't anticipate it, right? Andrew Huberman: Just as pornography is capitalizing on the sexual arousal reward circuit. Associated reward-- Robert Malenka: --No question about it. Just as the gambling industry does. I mean, as you know, the Vegas casinos have full time people developing algorithms for how frequently should a slot machine pay off. You know, what's the perfect amount of payoff to keep certain individuals coming back? Andrew Huberman: So pernicious. You can tell I've been spending a lot of time around addicts and former addicts. I've been researching some things for the podcast and a gambling addict told me something interesting. They said the real stinger with being a gambling addict is that the next time really could change everything, whereas no alcoholic says that, that the next drink could change everything for the better. Or the cocaine addict doesn't think, oh, the next line of cocaine could make all of life better now and forever, whereas the gambling addict actually holds in mind the infinitesimally small and yet real potential that the next time really could wipe out their debt and perhaps wipe out... And yet we know they would lose that, too, right? Whatever winnings they have. Robert Malenka: And casinos are fully aware of this. I have been told by friends who know they employ full time quantitative, for lack of a better term, I was going to say computer geeks. I don't mean that to be derogative. Andrew Huberman: And probably neuroscientists too. Robert Malenka: I would be amazed if they don't have neuroscientists who have expertise in what's called neuroeconomics or behavioral economics. I'm 95% sure that has to be the case. Andrew Huberman: I occasionally sit down to the roulette table because it’s just so passive and easy. And not long ago, actually, I had the experience of winning, not a large sum, but a meaningful sum of money. Robert Malenka: It's fun. Andrew Huberman: And I'll tell you, my sole mission at that point was to get up and go back to my room and not stop at another table. And I confess I pulled one brief stop at another table, played one hand and then lost it, and then just got back to my room as quickly as possible and then left Las Vegas as quickly as possible. Robert Malenka: Yeah, gambling is-- Andrew Huberman: --But they'll probably get me the next time-- Robert Malenka: --Yeah, gambling is, again, it all gets back to this reward circuitry, and the intermittent rewards are very powerful. Andrew Huberman: Well, and you mentioned earlier that the reward system is powerfully tuned to remember what were the behaviors that led up to the rewarding experience. Nobody ever won at the roulette or craps table or poker table by getting up and leaving. Robert Malenka: Right, exactly. Andrew Huberman: So I guess my brain was just thinking, well, how did I win? I won by sitting down and putting chips on the table, not by going back to my room. Robert Malenka: Exactly. Andrew Huberman: And yet I have a fair number of degrees, and I like to think my prefrontal cortex is working. And yet it was still challenging in that moment. Robert Malenka: Gambling is really another human activity that's quite complicated. It can be enjoyable or it can be incredibly damaging. Andrew Huberman: And now people are going to think I was that gambling addict that I was referred to, but I swear I'm not. Fortunately, I feel very blessed that that's not my addiction. I'd like to talk about empathy and use that as a framework for eventually returning to our discussion of autism. But you have this perhaps longstanding interest, but recent research interest in empathy. Tell me about this work. I'm not familiar with it. Robert Malenka: Okay. So I hope it's okay to drag in some work I've done on this drug called MDMA because it is related. So we were working on, in my lab, social behaviors, positive pro social behaviors that stimulated me to start thinking about what are components of a positive pro social, non aggressive interaction. A common key component of that is having some empathy and compassion for the individuals you're hanging out with. And it is a topic I've been interested in for many, many decades. I was once a psychiatrist, and to get on my, whatever the word is, hobby horse, I look at the world today. I try to be optimistic again. I am a child of the '60s and '70s. When I look at the world, and I actually just did a trip to Israel to give a series of lectures, and I look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, what always enters my mind, and I've felt this way for decades, is what is more important for the survival of the human species than empathy and compassion, than actually being able to look at another human being, even if they look different than you, even if they have a different belief system than you, what is more important than actually understanding that 98% of your life is very similar? You have some differences in how you look and the beliefs you have, but there's so much in common. So what's more important than understanding that when another person is suffering, their suffering is the same as your suffering and having compassion for somebody? So I started thinking, what is more important? And I'm not a politician. As you know, Andrew, I have no social media presence. I figured the only way I might be able to contribute to efforts that might help the human species enhance empathy and compassion is by studying the neurobiological underpinnings of it. And I didn't realize I might be able to do that until I started studying sociability or prosocial behaviors in mice. And then I was able to have a young woman scientist, and I want to give her credit, Monique Smith. You might want to have Monique on your podcast. She's a dynamo. She's now an assistant professor at UCSD, where you were. And Monique introduced me to a series of behavioral assays that I like to use the phrase, they are measurements, they are behavioral antecedents of empathy. Because in the world of psychologists and people who use the term empathy, it has a lot of different meanings to different people. I'm using it basically to mean one member of a species manifests some behavior that indicates it is being influenced by the emotional state, or what we call the affective state, effective with an “a” of another member of that species in its immediate environment. For human interactions. I just think, we were talking about friendships, any of us who watch a close friend suffer, it's hard. You want to do anything you can to help them. That's empathy. A mother with their child, a good mother, hopefully, when you have a kid who is sick, there's nothing worse. As a parent, you just want to take that pain and suffering away. That's how I'm defining empathy. So it's my belief that like any complex human behavior, there are evolutionary reasons why that has been adaptive and important and maintained. And if it's evolutionarily evolved, there are ways of studying it in more primitive organisms, like mice. So I'll tell you some of the behavioral assays we're doing. One is, and I get a kick out of this because it's pretty new for me, so one assay, and we published a paper in a journal called Science about this, which is if you take one mouse, and in an ethical way, you put it in pain, you make its hind paw, one of its paws, one of its feet hurt a modest amount, and you take another mouse and you let that, what's known as the bystander mouse, just hang out with the mouse that's in pain for 1 hour, just 1 hour. The bystander mouse, who has experienced no physical injury whatsoever, will manifest behaviors indicating it is now in pain. And it lasts maybe four to 20 hours. but think about that. A mouse that is normal hanging out with another mouse in pain starts feeling pain itself. Andrew Huberman: And the mice are able to see one another and hear one another? Robert Malenka: Good point. So you're getting to how is that communication happening? And a lot more work needs to be done on it. Monique and her previous colleagues and others. One component of it is probably an olfactory cue, or what we call a pheromone. Andrew Huberman: So the mouse that's in pain is secreting an odor?. Robert Malenka: Probably, because you can take bedding from mice in pain and expose the bystander mice, so that's one thing. And I had never heard of these behavioral assays. We developed our, and this is pretty cool, and then I'll tell you two others, and then I'll tell you how it connects to reward circuitry. We developed a novel assay, which is the social transfer of pain relief. Pain relief is called analgesia. And I thought this was pretty cool. And this is in this paper that was published in Science a year ago. You take two mice and they're both in pain, modest pain. I don't want your listeners to get upset. We are not hurting these mice too badly, and it is a tricky issue. Is it okay to put a mouse in pain so you can, the goal is to develop better treatments for human beings in pain, obviously. So you have two mice in modest pain. You give one mouse morphine. So it's now analgesic. It is no longer experiencing pain. You take another mouse that's in pain, and you just let it hang out with the mouse that is no longer in pain, and the mouse that is in pain will show behaviors indicating it is experiencing analgesia. It is no longer in as much pain. Now think about that, and there's actually evidence from human studies that I can't speak to in any comprehensive way where it's called social buffering of pain. To be honest, I've been having some neck pain just because I'm an old guy and I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. And if I'm by myself, I focus on that pain, and it bothers me more. If I'm socially engaged, I think it's not only that I'm not paying as much attention to the pain, but I think there's actually some relief from what's known as the social buffering of pain. Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm no hippie, but I actually think that all species, including humans, are secreting molecules, mainly odorants, that are perhaps even acting directly as analgesics. And I can make that statement without worrying too much that people think I'm completely crazy because we had Noam Sobel on the podcast from the Weisman who shared with us not one, not two, but at least a dozen ways in which humans are making molecules, typically odors, and communicating those to one another to powerfully impact their testosterone levels, their vasopressin levels, their immune molecules. And of course, Noam works on olfaction, so he's going to be biased toward that system. But that's just one slice of the sensory array. What about the way that somebody can look at us in a way that makes us feel good on a normal day? Well, when we're in pain, just even the touch to a shoulder can mean a lot. I remember going to meetings when I was an early neuroscientist, and I would probably at that point, have not been the type to just walk up and say hello to you because I wasn't in your field, and you're this luminary and stuff, but I remember as I started, I'm a good guy, by the way. You are very good. Robert Malenka: I always say hi to everyone. Andrew Huberman: I know you are. And that statement was a reflection on me, not a reflection on you. But as I advanced through my career, what I found was you'd give a talk or something, and someone in your field more senior to you, who you respected, would give a nod or something. Those nods meant a lot. Robert Malenka: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: Those nods could carry you a long distance. I mean, obviously, we want to be intrinsically driven to do the work we do, but this social communication that we do-- Robert Malenka: --We're a social species-- Andrew Huberman: --I think there's a whole landscape of things. So what you're describing is incredible, but I think makes a ton of sense. Robert Malenka: Yeah. So we have this social transfer, pain of analgesia here we're working on, and there's a little bit of evidence in the literature suggesting this might work. And then I'll talk about reward circuitry and maybe MDMA and is it an empathogen or not, and how that might influence therapeutic efforts for autism. We're working on behavioral models. We're asking the question, will one mouse behave to give another mouse a reward? So it's the mouse that's behaving that has to press a bar or nose poke or even experience a shock. Will the mouse do that simply to give one of its buddies a reward? Andrew Huberman: Pure altruism. Robert Malenka: Yeah. We call it generosity, a generosity assay. And early days, it looks like it might be working. And that's a generosity assay. We can also ask the question, will a mouse work? So another mouse doesn't get a shock, doesn't get hurt, which is compassion. And I think these things are going to be working. And whether you want to call that empathy, I would call it that. Those are behaviors, I like to use the term behavioral antecedents of how we define empathy in human beings and the connection to reward circuitry. And the little bit of work we have done on this is we presented evidence that these behaviors we call the social transfer of pain, one mouse experiencing pain just because it's hanging out with another mouse. The social transfer of analgesia. A mouse in pain getting some pain relief from hanging out with another mouse in pain, who has that pain relief. It seems to involve one component of the complex brain mechanisms, seems to involve a part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, which human brain imaging studies suggest is activated during empathic human responses. And the projections of that area into the nucleus accumbens. That's the connection. And we're interested in whether neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence this circuitry, these connections that are involved in these "empathic" behaviors, etc. , etc . And we think drugs can be used as probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms. I hope this is all making sense. Andrew Huberman: Makes excellent sense, and it's fascinating. I'm not one to suggest experiments to colleagues in areas where I don't work, but I'm going to anyway. Robert Malenka: Yeah, please. Andrew Huberman: One, You're a really smart guy. Robert Malenka: I will value your suggestions. Andrew Huberman: I love the motivational backbone to what you're describing here because I agree the world has a lot of issues, and what could be more important than to increase the amount of empathy and compassion in the world? But one thing that we know inhibits empathy and compassion is one's own challenges and struggles. And so I'm wondering if there's a way to introduce something to this behavioral paradigm such that the working to provide another animal relief from pain, one animal working to provide relief of another animal in pain, or an animal working to provide pleasure reward for another animal if it could be scaled with how inconvenient that work is. Robert Malenka: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: If I'm very hungry. I mean, we're all taught to put our own oxygen mask on first in some way too, so that we don't all die, so to speak. But I grew up, for instance, with one parent. My mother was the kind of person who would see, at that time, there were far fewer homeless people on the street. Maybe they were all institutionalized, I don't know. But if she saw a homeless person on the street of the town we lived in, she would literally pull over, give them money, find hotels. She had homeless people living in hotels all over the town we lived in. Robert Malenka: Good for her. Andrew Huberman: It was crazy. I mean, we couldn't get anywhere. That was the problem, is we would never arrive anywhere on time. And that's my excuse for always being late. I was positively reinforced for being late. I always run late, and I always run... Incredible, right? Just a very strong sense of social, fantastic connection, that kind of thing. But in any case, some people are like that. She could not experience any even modicum of inconvenience for helping others. Robert Malenka: Good. Andrew Huberman: Whereas I think most of us feel like if I'm rushing to catch a flight and I see someone who's struggling, I'm probably going to help them if they're in acute pain or it seems like a dire circumstance. But let's be honest, most people are probably going to prioritize their own stress and priorities, for lack of a better word, when the situation often calls for us to set those aside and tend to people that are suffering. So if there was a way to introduce a probe of the interplay of circuitries that involve how convenient or inconvenient it is. Robert Malenka: Fantastic. Andrew Huberman: Like if we're well fed, it's pretty easy to go out and gather and distribute food for others. But if we're hungry, we tend to focus on our own hunger. Robert Malenka: So first, in full disclosure, even though I'm studying empathy and compassion, I can look in the mirror and say, I probably don't practice it nearly as much as I should. I'm thinking of your example. If I was late for a plane, I'm not sure I would stop and help somebody. And I'm not saying-- Andrew Huberman: --I think it depends on w hat sort of suffering exactly. If they're hemorrhaging on the side-- Robert Malenka: --Of course-- Andrew Huberman: --we all would of course, but a flat tire, right? You might think, oh goodness, do I have time for this? Robert Malenka: Yeah, exactly. So I'm not proud of that statement. But back to your question. Yes, I think absolutely, we can design experiments where, after we've established the basic phenomenology, then we can take our subject animal or mouse and put it into certain circumstances. If it's hungry itself, will it work as hard to give another animal food? I mean, it's a good question because I'm not sure what the outcome will be. One could predict it might work harder because it understands the "hunger" more. Andrew Huberman: I love that. Robert Malenka: Or it could be, of course it's not going to work hard for another animal to get a food reward because it's starving itself and it needs to take care of itself first. It's a great question. We're also asking questions about, do you have to know your buddy mouse, right? Are you more likely to behave in a generous or compassionate way if you grew up with that mouse in the way our mice grow up in academic environments? And if it's a stranger, how will you behave? How will you behave if you had a fight with that mouse previously? And it also matters, did you win the fight or did you lose the fight? Intuitively, as we probably would all guess, I'm more likely to help somebody I defeated in a fight previously, because in the hierarchy, I'm the dominant one. I'm probably less likely if that person beat me up. So all these are great questions. I think we can study them. I also think there are ways we can study these kinds of interactions in human subjects. Not that I am going to do that myself. Andrew Huberman: Someone at Stanford will. [LAUGHS] Robert Malenka: Yeah. So I think there's also an opportunity, and I'm happy to discuss how neuromodulators, like in particular serotonin, but also perhaps dopamine and oxytocin, may influence the circuitry in the brain mechanisms that are mediating what I term empathic behaviors. Andrew Huberman: Let's return to autism. Robert Malenka: All right. Andrew Huberman: Does autism involve a lack of empathy? Does autism involve a restructuring of the reward system around social interactions? Robert Malenka: Maybe. Andrew Huberman: Considering the second question first, I could imagine, for instance, that there are variations in brain wiring that would make it such that a kid who then becomes an adult gets a tremendous amount of reward from, I don't know, math, designing mugs, any number of activities. But that through some variation in brain wiring social interaction, spending time with friends is just not as socially rewarding. It just doesn't feel good in the moment, doesn't necessarily feel bad, but it's not selected for. And is there any evidence that's the case in children who are classified as autistic or having autism? I want to be clear. I am not a world expert on pathophysiology of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. I have read some of the literature. I do study mouse models of genetically based autism spectrum disorder. Robert Malenka: So the answer is yes, there have been imaging studies, and again, so certain members of your audience don't get mad, remember our earlier conversation? We made the point that autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous set of behavioral symptoms with wide variation in how these symptoms manifest in each individual. So we cannot make blanket statements that individuals with autism spectrum disorder are this or that. But there are studies both in human beings and mice that suggest that the reinforcing component of a social interaction is much less or lacking in our models of autism spectrum disorder and certain individuals. An important point is, is that just genetically wired? Was that because in their early experiences, they weren't able to get the sensory stimuli that tell them this is a reinforcing social experience unknown, or at least those are topics that I think are worthy of investigation. Do individuals or mice with autism spectrum disorder lack or do not have the capacity or the same experience of empathy? Again, a very complex topic in question, and it's very likely for some individuals, the answer is yes, meaning they do lack some of the neural mechanisms that allow them. But that probably doesn't apply to everybody. I can say in our mouse models of social interactions and our mouse models of "empathy," our mice show deficits and those deficits can be rescued, meaning improved upon by manipulations of certain neuromodulatory systems, in this case, the serotonin system, by giving drugs, including a drug called MDMA or Ecstasy. So I hope I'm answering your question. I think these are worthwhile subjects for investigation. I think there's a lot of value in studying them. Andrew Huberman: Let's go back to serotonin in the nucleus accumbens. We will get into this in a bit more detail when we discuss MDMA. But I've now spent a lot of time with a recent paper of yours-- Robert Malenka: --Really? Which one? Andrew Huberman: The MDMA paper. Robert Malenka: The Boris Heifets one? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, that parsed the relative roles of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens versus serotonin in the nucleus accumbens . By the way, folks, by the time this episode comes out, an episode all about MDMA itself and its modes of action will have already aired, and you can find that, but even if you haven't heard that, MDMA is an amazing molecule because it profoundly increases dopamine, and that's why the word methamphetamine is actually in MDMA. Still a surprise to many people to hear that, but it also robustly increases serotonin transmission. And what I love about the paper from your lab that explored this is that, at least by my read of the data, it showed very convincingly that it's serotonin released in the nucleus accumbens that's responsible for the prosocial effects of MDMA, whereas oxytocin, this thing we talked about earlier that everyone assumes is the pair bonding molecule, the molecule of love, both in humans, now there's a study in humans and in the mouse work that you've done, doesn't seem to play as prominent a role in the social enhancement that MDMA causes. And the reason I'm asking this in the context of autism is that for a long time, there was excitement about the idea that oxytocin nasal sprays might make autistic kids more excited about social interactions, more tuned to social interactions. First question is, is there any evidence that increasing oxytocin in a child or adult with autism makes them somehow more social or desiring more social connections? I'm not aware of any. Robert Malenka: I think it is worthwhile. It has been studied. I don't think we can close the door on the potential therapeutic uses of oxytocin from the people I know who are much more expert in this than I am. I think most of the clinical trials have been pretty disappointing, with a lot of hope that intranasal oxytocin would promote more positive pro social experiences. I don't think the door is shut yet. There may be different ways of administering it. There may be ways of making a different type of oxytocin that might be beneficial. I have a colleague at Stanford who's actually looking at a related neuropeptide called vasopressin, and she's finding some potential benefit from that. And vasopressin and oxytocin are closely related to each other. They can even activate some of the same, what we call receptors in the brain. So I don't think the door is closed on the possibility of oxytocin or related therapeutic agents having some therapeutic potential. The evidence, as far as I'm aware, is not there yet in terms of MDMA, again, complicated story. As you pointed out, MDMA, its major molecular targets, don't want to get too technical here, are the serotonin vacuum cleaner, the molecule that vacuums up serotonin, and the dopamine vacuum cleaner, the molecule that vacuums up, and, excuse my language, sucks up dopamine when it's released, because it's an amphetamine derivative, as you correctly pointed out, it not only prevents these proteins, we call them, these molecules, these vacuum cleaners, from vacuuming up the dopamine and serotonin when it's released, it actually causes it, how do I, I don't want to use the terms to vomit out dopamine and serotonin-- Andrew Huberman: --That's what I say on the podcast-- Robert Malenka: --Am I allowed to say that?-- [LAUGHS] Andrew Huberman: --when I talk about synaptic release, I'm known for, on my solo episodes, for when I talk about synaptic release, I'll say that they [MAKES VOMITING SOUND] they vomit out. [LAUGHS] Robert Malenka: So what amphetamine derivatives-- Andrew Huberman: --But you work on synaptic transmission. That's almost an insult to a [inaudible] synaptic transmission. Robert Malenka: What MDMA does is it actually calls what's known as a reverse transport. It not only prevents the vacuum cleaners from sucking up the dopamine and serotonin, it causes it to spew out dopamine and serotonin. So imagine if your vacuum cleaner started, the pressure in your vacuum cleaner reversed, and all the dirt you collected started being spewed out. Now, the one difference for MDMA, and it's a fascinating topic, I hope we have time to talk about, is why does MDMA, qualitatively, for most people, give human subjects a different experience than cocaine or methamphetamine, or especially methamphetamine. Andrew Huberman: Presumably, it's the fact that there's so much serotonin. Robert Malenka: Exactly. And so if you actually get into, and this is why, for your audiences, this is why hardcore molecular science can actually teach us something about complex human behavioral phenomena, such as social interactions and addiction, at least the hypothesis we propose and others in the field. It's not just, science is not done in isolation. So I want to give credit where creditors do. We did not define the following, that MDMA affects the serotonin system more than the dopamine system. So it's not 50/50. Maybe it's 70/30, 80/20. And that's because the molecule itself of MDMA, again, I'm trying not to use language, it binds to, has a higher affinity, it likes to bind to and influence the serotonin vacuum cleaner more than the dopamine vacuum cleaner. It's still affecting both, but it's not 50/50. It's more, whatever, 70% serotonin, 30% dopamine. And then it does influence oxytocin in very complex ways, which is a further technical discussion. There was just a nice paper that came out that reported that serotonin releases in a hypothalamic structure, which, again, the hypothalamus, you can explain to your listeners. Andrew Huberman: A marble-ish size structure above the roof of your mouth, responsible for sex, temperature control, feeding and satiety, and a bunch of other things critical. Robert Malenka: And it's a home of neurons that produce oxytocin. Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Robert Malenka: So this paper reported that when serotonin is released in the hypothalamus, it activates and causes the release of oxytocin that's in the hypothalamus. Our work in the reward circuitry suggested oxytocin. So that's serotonin upstream of oxytocin in the hypothalamus, where we were looking in the accumbens, it was the opposite. Oxytocin caused the release of serotonin. So the point to your listeners is the brain is unfortunately complicated. It's tractable. We like to come up with general hypotheses and principles, but sometimes the devil's in the details, and we really need to probe deeper. So back to your question about our previous paper and dopamine and serotonin. So what we proposed, which is far from nailed down, is that MDMA, because it is an amphetamine derivative, does influence dopamine release and the dopamine system. And some of my colleagues in the MDMA field, who I respect enormously, don't like me to say this, but I'm going to say it anyhow. Remember earlier in the podcast, we talked about different substances having addictive liabilities? Doesn't mean a substance is automatically addictive, doesn't mean it's automatically not, it's a continuum, and I would argue that MDMA does have some addictive liability because it is an amphetamine derivative. Andrew Huberman: It feels good. Robert Malenka: And it feels good. And so there are individuals that, especially as your listeners may know, MDMA has gotten a lot of attention because it's in a therapeutic trial that looks very promising as an adjunct to psychotherapy for post traumatic stress disorder. And the FDA, the part of our government that approves or disapproves the legal distribution of therapeutic drugs, may end up approving MDMA for certain uses. The point being is that if it gets approved, my personal feeling is it will have some addictive liability. It also has this very powerful, what you and I might term Andrew, a pro social effect. Some people even call it an empathogen. That's a little controversial, meaning it enhances your capacity for empathy, to experience the emotional state of another individual, to want to understand that person's experiences and emotional state. And what we've suggested is that the addictive liability is mostly, although not solely, being, mediated by its actions on the dopamine system, whereas its positive, more pro social effects and perhaps its empathogenic effects are more likely to be mediated by its interactions with the serotonin system in this reward circuitry. And we're actually doing a lot of work to test that hypothesis. We're actually testing MDMA in these behavioral models of empathy in mice, and it looks like our hypothesis is being supported. The other thing to drive your listeners crazy about, sorry, listeners, how complex the brain is. If you think it-- Andrew Huberman: --Listen, neither you nor I were consulted at the design phase, and so we don't have to apologize for the brain's complexity . Robert Malenka: [LAUGHS] Because, trust me, as a scientist, I wish I could keep things as simple as possible. That's what good science is. It turns out serotonin is produced by neurons in another part of the brain with this wonderful name called the dorsal raphe nucleus. And it turns out the serotonin neurons talk to the dopamine neurons and influence the dopamine neurons. It's, again, the point we made earlier in your podcast, even though it's fun and useful both for your listeners and as scientists to think about these powerful chemical messengers in isolation, because that's how we can make progress scientifically. It's how your audience can understand some of the concepts that have been elucidated from brain research over the decades, but they don't work in isolation. They influence each other. They communicate with each other. We're actually doing studies showing that serotonin release in the accumbens actually modulates dopamine release. So it gets crazy complicated. But you can still develop simplistic hypotheses, like, as I was saying, about MDMA, where abuse, addictive liability, and some of its reinforcing qualities, which you just mentioned, MDMA, a lot of people find it fun to take it, is probably mostly being mediated via the dopamine system, and some of its social effects are being mediated by the serotonin system. We're actually doing studies to figure out whether the reinforcing component of a social experience requires that dopamine release. Probably does. Andrew Huberman: That's what I'm most interested in, really, in the context of MDMA. And we should just mention, because we do like to mention these caveats. Yes. And I can say this because I participated in a trial with MDMA. It is a very pleasant experience. It's certainly not for everybody. It still is a schedule one drug at this moment. Robert Malenka: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: So you can go to jail for possessing or selling it. In fact, there was a big bust recently in Canada and another one in Brussels. Large amounts of MDMA collected. Those people are probably going to go to prison for a long period of time. So you don't want to take it or possess it. It's illegal. We're talking about clinical trials here. But also the fentanyl issue. There's a lot of fentanyl contamination. Robert Malenka: And I was just going to mention it to your listeners. Andrew Huberman: So we'd be remiss if we didn't mention. A lot of people are dying thinking that they're taking one drug when they're taking another. So we are not encouraging the use of these. But I will say that the subjective experience of MDMA, provided it's done in the appropriate clinical setting, it's actually, MDMA doesn't contain other things dosed correctly, etc. , is a pleasant one, for sure. And my sense is that the dopamine release is reinforcing the experience, that the context that serotonin is providing with a social context and the word context there becomes important when we think about back to the 90s when there were a lot of raves and people were also getting, I guess, positive feedback from the interactions they were having, dancing all night, partying with friends, etc. I think that returning to the issue of autism and the role of serotonin, so in autism, there seems to be less of a reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions in some individuals with autism. And I'm aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the serotonergic system and dopamine system. So is it fentamine? Robert Malenka: To my knowledge, the only FDA approved pharmacologic therapeutic for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is actually, oh, God, I'm just blanking, it's not a serotonergic drug, I have to look it up. I want to say risperidone for agitation. There is no drug for, for lack of a better term, the social deficits. There's no FDA approved drug. If you look at the literature, psychiatrists and individuals with good intention have tested the utility of traditional serotonergic drugs like Prozac, SSRIs. There are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs that influence serotonin release, and another neuromodulator that you know well, norepinephrine and at least well done clinical trials, which in my view, as an academic, are very important. None of them have shown efficacy. Having said that, there are several companies, and full disclosure here, I am the founder of a small biotech called Maplite Therapeutics, and I'm not advertising for Maplite. I'm just doing a full disclosure. It was founded with Karl Deisseroth, who you've had on your podcast, and an entrepreneur in San Francisco named Karoly Nikolich. And we have a phase two trial. Phase two trial means it's a safe drug. We've done all the safety work, and it's a drug that targets a subtype of receptor for serotonin. Serotonin works on many different, I don't know, what word can I use other than receptors? Andrew Huberman: No, listeners of this podcast will probably be familiar with receptors, sort of parking spots for molecules. Yes. The paper I was referencing earlier from your lab, it talked about serotonin 1B receptors being particularly important. Robert Malenka: The point being is I do have an interest in this. Can you use the type of discoveries we've made in mice? Might it actually have any relevance to human beings, in particular those who, some of which have some sort of sociability deficits? Other companies are pursuing this, too. So MDMA itself, there has been. I don't know if it's ongoing. There's a well known organization. I don't know if you've ever had anybody from MAPS on this podcast. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. MAPS deserves a lot of credit for being a pioneer in saying, in particular with MDMA, promoting the idea that this drug deserves rigorous and ethical study. That's at least my view and MAPS , which was founded by an individual named Rick Doblin, deserves enormous credit for their 30 year effort to make it allowed and legal to actually study MDMA. The point I'm making is I know MAPS, and perhaps others, have done some small trials studying MDMA in individuals, high functioning individuals with some form of social anxiety. I'm saying this because this is public. There's another company called MindMed, which is one of the publicly traded psychedelic companies, and this is on their website. Full disclosure, I am on their scientific advisory board. They are gearing up to do a trial of a, I don't want to get too technical, of a certain form of MDMA. There are two different types of MDMA. They have these horrible names called enantiomers. So the MDMA that is used for clinical trials that MAPS, MDMA is a molecule, and it has mirror images of itself, and one has the name RMDMA and one has the name SMDMA, and they're called the enantiomers because they're mirror images of each other and other labs over the years, not my lab, I deserve no credit for this, have done some studies to suggest that the S enantiomer is the one that has a higher interaction with the dopamine system, and the R enantiomer has a higher interaction with the serotonin system. Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Robert Malenka: If you look at the literature on autism spectrum disorder in human subjects, there's a bunch of papers suggesting serotonergic systems are malfunctioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. And if you look at reviews I've written or any of my papers, we probably cite some of the reviews. Andrew Huberman: It's clear that serotonin is playing some role in social interactions, at least in mice and almost certainly in humans as well. It's hard to imagine, based on data from everything from SSRIs to neurotoxic lesions of the human brain, etc. , that it's not also playing at least a similar role in humans. Robert Malenka: Right, and I fully agree with that. And as we were discussing, there's a modestly extensive clinical literature, meaning literature from human subjects, suggesting that some aspects of brain systems that utilize serotonin as one of their signaling molecules, one of their neuromodulatory mechanisms, may not be functioning in some populations of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. So based on that, based on my lab's work on the role of serotonin in modifying reward circuitry, its role in pro social behaviors, and the biggest clue, which I think you would agree with, Andrew, is this drug, MDMA. I mean this is why, I am not a druggie myself, I am a child of the '60s and '70s, which means I'm 20 years older than you, Andrew. I did experiment, like everybody of my generation, with psychoactive substances in the 70s, so I don't want to lie about my experiences. I also will say, like many neuroscientists, my experiences with psychoactive substances stimulated my interest in neuroscience. How do these substances work? Why, when I was a young kid, the first time I got drunk on beer, why is that happening? But more seriously, I use drugs in my research as powerful probes of brain function with the advantage that, and now I'm talking scientist to scientist with you, Andrew, they have molecular targets that we can manipulate in rigorous ways. We can figure out where in the brain they act using the modern tools of neuroscience, which your audience may not know about. I'm saying this to you, conditional knockout mice, rescue experiments. We can do all this fancy stuff, and we can use drugs to study even things as complicated as empathy. And I really do believe that it's why I've been interested in MDMA for decades, is there's a clue there. How does a drug that has molecular targets in the dopamine neuromodulatory system, in the serotonin neuromodulatory system have such a powerful effect, which is relatively specific on social interactions? It doesn't make you want to go eat more donuts. I don't know, for me, there's a clue there. There's something really important from that phenomenological observation in the human experiences that we can learn from. Andrew Huberman: I completely agree about MDMA, and we've done a couple of podcasts about psilocybin and by extension, LSD, because even though there are differences there, psilocybin, LSD, as far as we understand, largely work through activation of the serotonin 2A receptor, broadening of a brain network connectivity. So again, it's serotonin, serotonin, serotonin, but different receptors, very different subjective experience. And I guess perhaps the best way to describe it is that LSD and Psilocybin are almost always considered mystical in their subjective effects, whereas MDMA can be an empathogen, an actogen, and so serotonin acting through different receptor systems, impacting and creating very different subjective experiences. I also agree. I think MDMA is particularly interesting for the neuroscientist, perhaps also because, at least to my knowledge, there is no substance in nature, no plant, no mushroom, no ergot, no mold that creates this increase in dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. MDMA is a synthesized molecule, and so it may be one of the, again, highlighting all the safety issues and things we talked about before. It may be one of the great, at least experimental probes of the brain that humans have developed, and it may be one of the great therapeutic probes that folks like MAPS are now doing such fantastic work on. So I'm very excited about what's happening with the research on MDMA, and I'm so glad that your laboratory has parsed some of the relative roles of serotonin, the receptors involved. Since we mentioned serotonin 2A for psilocybin and LSD, we'd be remiss if we didn't say that this wonderful paper that we will provide a link to in the show note captions. By the way, folks, that Rob Malenka here's lab focused on the serotonin 1B receptor, so even just differences in receptor subtypes leading to profoundly different subjective outcomes, I find that to be just one of the most important areas that one could even think about, let alone work on. Robert Malenka: Thank you. I appreciate the compliment. I will also say, like everything we're finding, it's not all about only serotonin 1B, but as you know, again, pointing to the amazing and powerful complexity of the human brain or the mammalian brain, there are 16 different serotonin parking spots or receptors that are distributed in different brain areas in complex ways. And so that's daunting. But it also offers possibilities for developing very novel therapeutic agents that activate or inhibit these in complex ways, hopefully for therapeutic benefit. Andrew Huberman: So, before we conclude, I'm very curious to get your opinion on what you see as the landscape of the work on psychedelics and MDMA, which isn't really a classic psychedelic, but all these drugs that, as you pointed out during your youth, were used recreationally and for mind exploration and expansion and are now being probed as potential therapeutics for various mental health challenges, as well as potentially expanding consciousness, empathy, and all of that. I mean, not getting into the details of the legal issues that have to be overcome, not even necessarily talking about the clinical trials or the people doing the work in different laboratories, but just, I have to imagine this must amuse, tickle, surprise you. I mean, how do you feel about what you're seeing now? Because it is a very exciting time for these compounds. Robert Malenka: It tickles me and excites me with the appropriate caution. So I do think drugs are very powerful probes of brain function. I think this class of drug, which, as you correctly pointed out, people use the term psychedelics scientifically. When pursuing their understanding, their therapeutic potential, their mechanism of action. It's more useful to divide them up into different categories. The classic hallucinogens, which are LSD and psilocybin, the intact or empathogens, which is MDMA, which is really a qualitatively different drug. There are other substances which we don't have time to talk about, like ibogaine and ayahuasca, which are very complex, and peyote. But nevertheless, I am tickled and excited as a child of the '60s and '70s. But I am also not evangelical about their use and their therapeutic potential. So as you can imagine what I'm going to say, I think they should be the subject of rigorous, sophisticated, and most importantly, ethical research. I think we could learn a lot about how the brain works and its amazing capabilities. I think they may notice, I say may have therapeutic potential, but I do not think they're going to be miracle cures. And I do worry, as somebody who lived through the '60s and '70s and watched, because of the history of Timothy Leary and his colleagues, and the political landscape of how they were being used and promoted, I am cautious that these substances need to be studied scientifically and rigorously, and I hope that's the case. And I want to caution your audience that not everybody should take these substances. They are not miracle cures. And while they certainly may be of benefit to certain individuals who are suffering, and they certainly may provide unusual and "mystical" experiences for certain individuals, I am very concerned that there are individuals out there that will gain access to these substances and have very bad experiences, because anybody who grew up in the '60s and '70s knows all about bad trips, and truth be told, I have had a bad trip or two in the '70s, and I'm glad I did, because it made me... I have no idea what a suicidal depression feels like where you are experiencing such a darkness, such a lack of hope that a rational decision is to end one's life. And I think the closest I ever came to that experience is a bad trip on LSD. And I do have concerns that if you look at the clinical trials that have been done, the well done, not the anecdotal, I went and saw some psychedelic therapist that a friend recommended and it did wonders for me. But the well controlled clinical trials that are being done by certain biotechs, some academic institutions, they have very strict, what are known as inclusionary and exclusionary criteria about who is allowed to participate in the subject, and they rule out a lot of people. So I don't mean to be overly cautious, but I do worry that if some people take these substances and bad things happen, it will slow down the excitement that's currently happening, and it will make it more difficult for serious human subjects researchers, preclinical researchers, to study these substances in the way they deserve to be studied. So I hope that articulates my viewpoint. Andrew Huberman: I think it does, and thank you for that viewpoint. It's an important counterbalance on a lot of the excitement that we hear about these days. I think the state of Kentucky just recently decided to give $42 million from the opioid lawsuit settlement with Purdue pharmaceuticals to the study of ibogaine. So there's a lot happening. Robert Malenka: Just to be clear, I think there's no problem with that, and I actually would support that. As long as the studies of ibogaine are done thoughtfully, carefully, and ethically, I see no problem with testing its efficacy in certain mental illnesses and addiction. And it's actually a topic I know a little bit about, but we'll save that for another time. Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, first off, I want to thank you for coming here and sharing your knowledge with all of us. For me, it's been a real thrill. And I also just want to thank you for the incredible amount of work that you've done over the years. I know it's still ongoing. You're by no means retiring. I certainly hope not. But I'm sure the listeners have now gotten a clear picture of the enormous number of contributions and areas you've worked on everywhere from, as I mentioned earlier, neuroplasticity at the cellular level, molecular level, addiction, work relating to social cognition and social interactions, rather as it pertains to autism models, and now psychedelics and empathy, and on and on and again, trained so many prominent scientists in our field, and to take time out of your schedule to come sit here with us and share some of that knowledge and stimulate our thinking and, as you mentioned, raise still more questions that need to be resolved is a real privilege. So thank you ever so much. And indeed, as you just mentioned, we'd love to have you back again for another conversation. Robert Malenka: All I can say is I want to thank you for having me. I was a little hesitant or nervous about coming here, and now I want to come back. So that was a blast, what I just did with you, and I'd be happy to continue this conversation anytime. So thank you for your very sophisticated and thoughtful questions. Andrew Huberman: To be continued. Robert Malenka: Yeah, to be continued.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing ways to improve your fitness. In particular we are going to discuss tools that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine that will allow you to make significant improvement without having to invest a lot of extra time. Most all of the tools we are going to discuss today were gleaned from the 6 episodes that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin. We provide a link to those full episodes in the show note captions, of course. Now, those episodes included a very large number of protocols, everything from how to build a fitness, routine how to enhance recovery, nutrition and supplementation, exercises and routines aimed specifically at strength or hypertrophy or endurance or building anaerobic capacity. What I've done is to select key protocols from those episodes that I myself have started to incorporate into my existing fitness routine and that I think will be especially beneficial and frankly fun for you to incorporate into your fitness routine. Now, a little bit later in this episode, I review the key components of any fitness program, that is the number and type of cardiovascular training sessions and resistance training sessions that are essential for everyone to include as a template or a foundation for their overall fitness program. Now, a little bit later in the episode, I will be sure to review what are the essential components of any fitness program, so the number and type of resistance training sessions, the number and type of cardiovascular training sessions, as well as some of the elements of how those are arranged to ensure proper and adequate recovery between sessions so that you can continue to make ongoing progress. However, the bulk of today's discussion is going to focus on tools that you can use again very easily, very quickly, in some cases even saving you time during your fitness regimen in order to improve all aspects of your fitness, your endurance, your muscular endurance, your anaerobic capacity, your recovery, your strength, your hypertrophy. And in describing these tools to improve your fitness, it also provides an opportunity for each and all of us to step back from our existing fitness routine and ask whether or not it's really checking off all the boxes that are necessary, as well as where we can be more economical with our time and our efforts in order to reach our specific goals related to exercise and performance. So by the end of today's episode, you can be sure that you have at least one and as many as 12 tools that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine, again, without adding much additional time or effort that are sure to accelerates your progress. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't, that means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, the electrolytes, but no sugar. Having adequate electrolytes is absolutely critical to cellular function, in particular the function of neurons. In order for your neurons to function properly you need electrolytes in your system, and you need to be well hydrated. There's a lot of research to support the fact that if you are even mildly dehydrated, that your cognition suffers, your physical performance suffers, and your sleep can also suffer. So getting adequate electrolytes and hydration is key, and element allows you to do that. I typically mix LMNT into 16 to 32 ounces of water and drink that first thing in the morning. I'll also drink another one during exercise, and sometimes another one after exercise as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, or it's a particularly hot day. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman, and that's spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman. And you can claim a free sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklmnt, L-M-N-T.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. And I say that because when we are not sleeping well or enough, all of those things suffer. Conversely, when we are sleeping well and we're sleeping enough, all of those things improve. One of the key elements to getting a great night's sleep is to have the proper mattress. Helix mattresses are different because they are customized to your unique sleep needs. So if you go to their website and take a brief 2-minute quiz, they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. The quiz asks questions such as do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach? Perhaps you don't know, that's fine too. Or do you tend to run hot or cold during the night? Things of that sort that allow them to match you to a mattress that will give you the best possible night's sleep. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a few years ago and it has vastly improved my sleep. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman to take that 2-minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress. You can also get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows. Again if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/hurberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about tools to improve your fitness. Before we do that, however, I just want to briefly remind everybody what constitutes a core or a foundational fitness program. Now, what I'm about to describe is not for the athlete that's trying to just improve one aspect of fitness or sports performance. So for instance, if you are a powerlifter and your main goal is to move more weight on the core powerlifting movements, or if you are somebody training for a marathon, it's likely that your core fitness program will differ substantially from what I'm about to describe. However, the vast majority of you are almost certainly trying to have some level of cardiovascular fitness. So the ability perhaps to run a mile or more, certainly to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded, you almost certainly want some degree of strength, the ability to perhaps pick up a heavy load of groceries and carry it in one arm as you carry something else in the other arm. You want the ability to help move furniture. You want the ability certainly to not injure yourself when performing daily tasks, and perhaps you also want to be able to go out and play a pickup game of basketball or soccer, or to go out on a long hike with a family without feeling so sore that you have to rest in bed the next day. An optimal fitness program of the sort that was covered in the optimal fitness protocols episode that I did is therefore one that checks off the major boxes that science tells us are important for health span and for lifespan, and that can also help us improve various aspects of performance, and improve various aspects of aesthetics, whether it's fat loss or muscle growth, if we choose. So without going into that program in a lot of detail, the core elements of it are that it includes at least 150 minutes and ideally more like 200 minutes per week of so-called zone 2 cardio. I'll talk a little bit more about zone 2 cardio a little bit later in the episode. But zone 2 cardio is for, those of you that don't know, a type of cardiovascular exercise that you can do while maintaining a conversation without getting winded but that if you were to push a little bit harder, that you would find it hard to complete your sentences. In general, zone 2 cardio is the sort that you can do while purely nasal breathing, unless you need to talk, of course, it's perfectly fine to talk while doing zone 2 cardio. And again the scientific research tells us that we should all be getting at least 150 minutes and probably more like 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week. Now, in addition to that, a foundational or optimal fitness program for most people is going to include anywhere from 2-4 cardiovascular training sessions that are separate-- that's right-- separate from the zone 2 cardio, as well as 2-4 resistance or strength training, sometimes also aimed at hypertrophy or muscle growth training sessions. Now, we have to acknowledge that most people are probably not going to hit the upper threshold of all of those three things. Most people simply do not have the time and/or discipline to get 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week, plus four resistance training sessions, plus four cardiovascular training sessions that are separate from the zone 2 cardio. As a consequence, the optimal fitness program that I described in that episode, and by the way, it's the program that I've essentially followed for the last 30 years or more, includes three cardiovascular training sessions. So one of longer duration sort of typical endurance type training. This would be a long, slow jog or a long hike one day per week, as well as a shorter cardiovascular training session of about 25 to 30 minutes moving a bit faster, getting the heart rate up a bit more, breathing a little bit harder, as well as one very short cardiovascular training session that would fall under the category of high-intensity interval training, things like sprints, which don't necessarily have to be done running. Could be done on a rower. It could be done on a bike, et cetera. So three cardiovascular training sessions, as well as three resistance training sessions. I want to acknowledge that resistance training can be done with body weight. It can be done with weights, with machines. I talked about the differing virtues of one approach versus another, but nonetheless, three resistance training sessions. One focusing specifically on leg training. One focused specifically on torso training. That's right, chest, shoulders, and back altogether, as well as some neck training for important reasons that were mentioned in that episode. And then a third session that was aimed at somewhat smaller body parts, biceps, triceps, calves, and some other small body parts that tend to be neglected and that are important to train if one wants to encourage muscular balance both aesthetically and structurally to avoid injury and have excellent posture. So those were the core elements of that foundational fitness program. And I mentioned then and I'll mention again now that that program is not a mandate. It is not an absolute requirement for anyone to follow. It was simply meant as a template from which people could evaluate their own existing fitness program, perhaps modify it somewhat or a lot, or if you were interested in trying that specific fitness program, that you could do that. And we have provided a link both to that episode in the show note captions, but we've also provided a link to a table or chart that describes that foundational fitness program. It provides examples of different cardiovascular training and resistance type training sessions. And it describes some potential exercises and the rationale for those exercises, and the rationale for selecting particular repetition ranges and rest between sets. All of that information is available completely zero cost. You don't even need to sign up for anything. You simply go to the link that we provided in the show note captions, and there's a downloadable PDF there for you to explore. Now, in addition to the solo episode that I did about optimal fitness protocols, we did a six-episode guest series with Dr. Andy Galpin, who is a professor of physiology at Cal State Fullerton and a world expert in all aspects of exercise and muscle physiology. That episode described a lot of the science, and in particular science-backed tools for improving everything from long-distance endurance to anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, speed, power, recovery, nutrition, supplementation, and ways to develop a year-long program that will ensure you ongoing progress. In that series, Dr. Andy Galpin provided an enormous amount of valuable information, such that anyone and everyone, meaning the person who's just interested in starting a fitness program, or improving their existing fitness program, or the elite athlete who is interested in improving their sprint times, or their jump height, or their powerlifting, or their marathon time, could clearly benefit from some or all of the protocols that he described. Now, because that series is so extensive in terms of its depth and breadth, again, providing so much value at 0 cost thanks to Dr. Andy Galpin's expertise, but at the same time because it might be a little bit intimidating for many people out there to try and figure out which protocols to incorporate into their existing fitness regimen, I thought it would be fun and very beneficial to talk about some of the key tools that were described throughout that series that one could consider incorporating into their existing fitness routine now. So that's what this episode is really about. It's about the tools that I personally gleaned from those discussions and that I found to be of tremendous value in improving both my cardiovascular fitness, my strength and hypertrophy training, my recovery, and other aspects of my overall fitness protocols. And when I say beneficial, I mean in terms of improving my cardiovascular fitness, improving my strength and hypertrophy training, and that have improved the various metrics of fitness lifespan and health span which include things like heart rate variability, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max, as well as some of the fitness metrics that were described during that episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin, such as performance metrics, the ability to jump a certain distance, the ability to run a certain speed or to run a certain distance at a given speed, the ability to move weights in good form for a certain number of repetitions. Again, all of the metrics of performance and health are going to vary tremendously from person to person depending on where you're starting, how long you've been training, and other aspects of your health. The tools described in today's episode are designed for everybody. Again, these are simple tools that you can put into your existing routine that should really move the needle forward in terms of improving your overall levels of fitness and health. OK, let's talk about the tools to improve your fitness. The first tool is to mesh your zone 2 cardio with your daily activities. So for those of you that don't know, zone 2 cardio is the type of movement that we typically call cardio exercise that elevates your heart rate somewhat, increases your breathing somewhat, but that still allows you to carry out a conversation without having to pause or to gasp in order to complete your sentences. OK. So that's a general rule of thumb for zone 2 cardio. Now, for those of you that use a fitness tracker, you can monitor whether or not you are in zone 2 cardio very precisely. But if you're like me and you don't use a fitness tracker, it's very easy to know if you're in zone 2 cardio because again, it's that level of output that puts you right below or somewhat below the threshold where if you were to exert yourself with any more intensity, that you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences. Now, this could, of course, be evaluated by jogging with someone or walking with someone or hiking with someone and carrying out a conversation. If somebody isn't available, you could, of course, do this by trying to speak out loud and have a conversation with yourself, or if you want another way to monitor whether or not you're in zone 2 cardio without having to use a fitness tracker, you could simply ask yourself whether or not you are maintaining a level of output that increases your heart rate and your breathing but that allows you to maintain purely nasal breathing the entire time. Any of those approaches will tell you more or less whether or not you're in zone 2 cardio. Now, the scientific data tell us that we should all be getting anywhere from 150 minutes to 200 minutes per week minimum of zone 2 cardio for sake of cardiovascular health, cerebrovascular health, and a number of other aspects of health that are important essentially to everybody for health span and life span Now, many people including myself, schedule zone 2 cardio into their weekly fitness regimen. So for me, I have one day a week. For me it falls on a Sunday where I go out for a jog that lasts anywhere from 60 minutes to 90 minutes. It's a slow jog. I can maintain nasal breathing the entire time or have a conversation with somebody else or myself the entire time if I like. Or sometimes it consists of a hike by myself or with other people, and sometimes those hikes extend anywhere from an hour to four hours depending on the circumstances, et cetera. I will mention that whenever possible, I try and do that once a week zone 2 cardio session out of doors because I like being in nature, and I like getting sunlight, and I like getting fresh air. Now, during the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin, I explained how I get my zone 2 cardio. And I acknowledged that once-a-week session doesn't always allow me to reach that 150-minute to 200-minute minimum threshold of zone 2 cardio per week. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. And his response to that was very reassuring. What he said was, look, if you want to schedule zone 2 cardio and head out for a long Sunday jog or hike, terrific. If you want to schedule a zone 2 cardio as two or more sessions on the treadmill or on the bike, great. But that he doesn't actually think of zone 2 cardio as exercise at all. And to that I gasped, and then I was a little bit deflated. I thought, oh, great. I've been doing all this zone 2 cardio, and you don't even consider that exercise. And then what he said was very reassuring, and I think it's going to be very reassuring to all of you. He said, first of all, zone 2 cardio is absolutely critical to our health for a number of reasons that I already mentioned. But in addition to that, zone 2 cardio does not impede, and in fact, can enhance our other aspects of fitness. So for example, our strength training, our hypertrophy training, or any type of speed work, or other types of cardiovascular training one might do. And that the best way to get zone 2 cardio is OK, if you want to schedule it, schedule it as a session. But that to simply increase the amount of walking and in particular, walking at a rapid pace that one does, and to increase the total amount of movement that one's getting throughout the week. So taking groceries in and out of the grocery store, running around with the kids, taking a walk with a coworker while having a work discussion, taking your calls for work while pacing in the office or going outside, what he impressed on me is that zone 2 cardio can be meshed throughout the daily activities that I and everybody else generally have to do. And this was of great relief to me because I as many of you are, I'm extremely busy. I don't have time to schedule in more cardio per week, or at least I don't see the way I could do that without reducing the amount of sleep that I'm getting, or without reducing the amount of social connection that I'm getting with family and friends, both of which are extremely important to our mental health and physical health. So the basic tool here is yes, get 200 minutes per week minimum of zone 2 cardio. And notice I said 200 minutes, not 150 minutes to 200 minutes. I'm going to set the higher threshold of 200 minutes per week minimum of zone 2 cardio. But that you don't need to schedule that as time on the treadmill. If you want to, great. But what was communicated to me from Dr. Andy Galpin is that zone 2 cardio is immensely beneficial, it's not going to impede, and in fact, it's going to improve other aspects of fitness, and that it does not have to impede and it in fact can improve other aspects of our daily life like our ability to engage socially, our ability to have a great output at work in whatever type of work you do. So the message is very simple, get 200 minutes or more of zone 2 cardio per week. And the message is also a very reassuring one which is that zone 2 cardio can be spread throughout your daily activities, and that if you're doing enough of it, you probably don't even have to count the total amount of zone 2 cardio that you're getting. If you simply make the effort to move around a lot more during your daily activities and to mesh that zone 2 cardio with your daily activities, you're going to hit that threshold of 200 minutes per week minimum. Now, that's a great message for me because I'm already doing the three resistance training workouts per week. I'm doing what now I can just call the two other cardiovascular training workouts per week because now I don't even count that long Sunday jog or Sunday hike as exercise. I just consider that movement out of doors on the weekend. And in doing so, it's also allowed me to really enjoy that a lot more. There's something about considering something a fitness training program that shifts it from just recreation and enjoying life to training. And I, of course, love training. I love training in the gym, and I love training out of doors. I love running. I love lifting weights. I love all sorts of physical training. I know many people do, I know many people don't. But if one looks at zone 2 cardio as just part of their daily life, you're far more likely to get that zone 2 cardio in and all the benefits that come with it. And you're also opening up time for work for social engagements and to do and pay attention to other aspects of fitness, which is what we're going to talk about next. The second tool that I've incorporated into my fitness regimen and that I believe can be of great benefit to frankly everybody is to start including low repetition, pure strength work. Now, some of you may already be doing low repetition, pure strength work. But I believe that most people don't. Most people who do resistance training are using either machines, or free weights, or some combination of those, or perhaps they're using body weight. And they tend to focus on repetition ranges from about 5 and usually more like 6 repetitions out to about 10 and perhaps 15 repetitions. Now, of course, doing resistance training and repetition ranges of 5-15 reps per set, provided it's done at sufficient intensity, so either to failure or close to failure, of course, in good form is tremendously beneficial. It can help build strength. It can enhance hypertrophy. There is tremendous value to training in those repetition ranges. But when I sat down with Dr. Andy Galpin to discuss resistance training, specifically, he made it very clear that at least for some portion of one's yearly training cycle. So perhaps eight weeks or 10 weeks, or in the case that I adopted 12 weeks, there is tremendous benefit to training in the 3 to 5 repetition range and maybe even lower. So the second tool of training specifically for strength in the 3 to 5 repetition range is something that I started to incorporate after I sat down to record that series. And I'll just tell you a few of the benefits that I've experienced, and then I'll tell you the specific protocol that makes it very easy to do this. The most obvious benefit to me was that I got much stronger. And that that strength persisted such that when I went back to using higher repetition ranges, so typically I train with weights or machines in the 6 to 10 repetition range, sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower. But never before had I specifically trained in the 3 to 5 repetition range exclusively for a period of 10 to 12 weeks. And when I did that, I, of course, gained strength. But that strength stayed with me such that when I returned to higher repetition ranges, I could use more weight in good form, and that, of course, enhanced strength and hypertrophy further. In addition, there was another effect that was at least to me very unexpected, which was that my cardiovascular training improved significantly. Now, why would this be? Because typically a 3 to 5 repetition set does not elevate the heart rate for long enough that you would consider it cardiovascular training. And of course, the rest periods between those sets is pretty long as well. So even if heart rate goes up during those heavy sets, it's going to go down during those long 3 to 5 minute rest periods between those sets. But what I noticed was that my overall posture and my ability to maintain cardiovascular output while using good running form or good rowing form was also vastly improved. And the logical interpretation of why that would be is simply that the muscles got stronger, and those same muscles are being incorporated into the cardiovascular-- let's call it endurance work that I'm doing on other days. And therefore, I can carry out those cardiovascular training sessions in better form for longer periods of time. I actually felt much stronger during my cardiovascular training as I got much stronger moving these heavier weight loads for low repetition sets. And then the third specific benefit that I noticed is that when training heavy for 3 to 5 repetitions per set, I didn't get sore. And this to me was an incredible benefit because typically when I train in the 6 repetition to 15 repetition range and I take those sets to failure or near failure, I do experience some soreness the next day. Ordinarily that soreness isn't so intense that it prevents me from doing any of the other sorts of workouts that I do. And for those of you that have visited that foundational fitness protocol, you know that I hit each major and minor muscle group once per week directly as well as once per week indirectly. That's the overall structure of that program in order to allow sufficient recovery between those resistance training workouts to be able to make continual progress. Now, by training in this 3 to 5 repetition range that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested, I was able to improve my strength, improve my cardiovascular output, reduce soreness. I also just felt better overall. I had a lot more energy after those workouts than I typically do after my resistance training sessions when I use higher repetition ranges. There are just a number of different things that made me feel, wow, this is really a powerful protocol. And of course, moving heavier weights in the gym feels good too. It feels good to get stronger. At least there's a positive feedback loop there for me, and I think for most people. And I should also mention that for those of you that are averse to doing heavier resistance training in the 3 to 5 repetition range because you fear that it will make you too big or too bulky, training in the low repetition ranges is actually more geared towards increasing strength and is shifting away somewhat from increasing hypertrophy or muscle size. So that's a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness, but you don't want to add muscular size. And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size, it's well established that increasing your strength will allow you then to return to patterns of hypertrophy training that will allow you to use heavier weights, and therefore induce greater hypertrophy. So there are oh, so many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols. So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it and was the way that I did it is he used this 3 by 5 protocol. The 3 by 5 protocol is very straightforward. It involves doing three to five exercises per workout. OK. So if it's a workout for legs, it's three to five exercises. If it's a workout for some upper body muscle, it's three to five exercises. Three to five exercises for 3 to 5 sets per exercise, 3 to 5 repetitions per set, and 3 to 5 minutes of rest between each set. In addition, he emphasized that one can do those workouts three to five times per week. Although, I'm going to put an asterisk next to that last statement because I found that I couldn't do the 3 by 5 protocol say for legs specifically three to five times per week. I realize that might be possible for some people, but I'm somebody who like many of you out there, either doesn't have the time or doesn't have the recovery capacity to train my legs three to five times per week. Even though I acknowledge that there are probably ways to do that would still allow me to recover, it just simply starts to impede into other areas of training. It starts to impede other areas of life like work and family and sleep and all the rest. So what I did and what I'm suggesting you try is for any existing resistance training that you're doing, to take a period of 8 or 10 or ideally 12 weeks and do the vast majority, if not all of that resistance training in the lower repetition range that's designed specifically to induce strength adaptations. And to not pay attention to whether or not you're hitting that same muscle group three to five times per week, rather if you train your legs once or twice per week, to simply do all of the work for your legs in that 3 to 5 repetition range. If you train an upper body muscle or muscle groups, chest, shoulders, back once per week or twice per week to just stay within that 3 to 5 repetition range for those work sets. Warm-ups can include a few more reps. And then to adhere to this three to five exercises, 3 to 5 sets per exercise, 3 to 5 repetitions per set, and 3 to 5 minutes between sets. Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups. So for instance, the rear deltoids or for neck work, or for calf work to not rely purely on 3 to 5 repetitions but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from 5 to 8 repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions but not so low that it restricts you to 3 to 5 repetitions. The reason for that is that I and I think a lot of people out there find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However, for big compound movements like presses and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort, maybe even leg extensions and leg curls, which are isolation exercises, of course, to really restrict oneself to those 3 to 5 repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced, and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are, you get stronger, which feels great. That occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions. I also noticed that when returning to higher repetitions for resistance training, so after 12 weeks shifting away from 3 to 5 repetition ranges and going back to training in the 6 to 10 repetition ranges mainly. Occasionally up to 12 or 15 but really mainly restricting to 6 to 10 repetitions that you can move much heavier weights in good form, and thereby induce more hypertrophy while still also continuing to gain some strength. And another benefit was again reduced soreness compared to when training with higher repetition ranges and more mental freshness, I guess the only way to describe it, when training in those lower repetition ranges. I don't know about you, but when I finish a really hard hour-long resistance training session done in the 6 to 12 repetition range, there's a certain type of mental fatigue that even if I eat properly afterwards, even if I hydrate properly, that it tends to sap a bit of my mental energy later in the day. But that the training at the 3 to 5 repetition range did just the opposite. It actually enhanced my focus and my cognition, my overall levels of physical energy, which is great because it allows you to do all the other things that we're required to do throughout the day. And by the way, it will also allow you to get more of that zone 2 cardio. So if you want more details on the 3 by 5 protocol, again, that's time stamped in the relevant episode on strength and hypertrophy that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin. I'll also provide a link to that specific time stamp in the show note caption to this episode. I do want to point out that you don't just jump right into heavy sets of 3 to 5 repetitions, you need to warm up adequately. For some people that warm-up will be higher repetition sets, so say 10 to 12 repetitions with just the empty bar or a lightweight. And then adding a little bit of weight and doing 8 repetitions and maybe 6 repetitions, and then your work sets as they're called of 3 to 5 repetitions. Or perhaps you're like me and you prefer to do low repetition warm-ups. So this was also something that I discussed with Dr. Andy Galpin and that for me has made a tremendous positive impact on all my resistance training, regardless of whether or not it is low repetition or high repetition. And that's to do a brief warm set that is somewhere in the range of 6 to 8 repetitions, very light just to get familiar with the movement. Then to do a second warm-up set that includes some load on the bar or the free weight or the machine. And then a second warm-up set-- again, this could be free weights or machines that incorporates a bit more load but still keeps the repetitions low so in the 4 to 6 repetition range. And then maybe, especially if it's at the beginning of the workout and my core body temperature isn't elevated yet, I'll do a third warm-up. But that third warm up which, of course, is going to be progressively a little bit heavier than the first or second warm-up, is still going to fall within the low repetition range so just 2 to 4 repetitions. For me, including a few more warm-up sets with progressively heavier weight on each warm up but still keeping the total repetition count low, so somewhere in the range of 2 to 6 repetitions, has been very beneficial for improving my work output during the so-called work sets regardless of whether or not I'm training in the 3 to 5 repetition range or whether or not I'm training in the 6 to 15 repetition range. I know for some people, this might be kind of surprising, how is it that my work sets are actually higher repetition than my warm-up sets? Or put differently, how and why is it that my warm-up sets are lower repetition than my work sets? And that's because I fall into this category of people that tends to fatigue pretty quickly when doing resistance training. So for me, keeping the repetition count on any individual warm up set pretty low has allowed me to really improve my strength output and really improve my strength and hypertrophy training when I shift to the so-called work sets. So I already listed off a number of important documented benefits and benefits that I've certainly experienced by incorporating low repetition, pure strength work into my yearly training cycle for periods of 8 to 12 weeks. In addition to that, during my conversation with Dr. Andy Galpin, he said something very important for everyone to hear and understand. He said, when you look at the data on aging and performance, in particular muscular performance, you see some very interesting patterns within the data. He said for instance, that for every year after age 40, there's a 1% drop in muscle size that can be offset by resistance training. But that if you don't do resistance training, that you won't offset. And during that series, we also talked about the minimum requirement for 6 and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size, not just age 40 and beyond but even at younger ages. OK. So that's muscle size. 1% decrease per year unless you do the right thing. And the right thing is get 6 to 10 working sets per week in order to offset that decrease. And if you train properly for hypertrophy, yes, you can still increase muscle size past age 40. In addition, he said that there is a 3% to 5% reduction per year for every year past age 40 in strength and power. Now, that's a very important metric because what it's telling us is that the drop off in strength and power is significantly greater per each year after age 40 than is the decrease in muscle size, telling us that we have to do something to offset that decrease in strength and power. In addition, he mentioned that for every year past age 40, there is an 8% to 10% decrease in speed and in explosiveness. And so if one is interested in maintaining speed of muscular movement and explosiveness of muscular movement, something that's perhaps important to a number of you, one also has to incorporate training specifically geared toward maintaining or improving speed and explosiveness. Now, I like many people am not so interested in speed and explosiveness, I know they have their utility, but I am interested in maintaining muscle size over the course of my life, perhaps even adding some muscle to a particular muscle groups. I'm also very interested in at least maintaining and ideally even gaining some strength in certain muscle groups throughout my entire lifespan. And that's not just for performance reasons. That's also because we know that maintaining or improving strength of our muscles is very important across the entire lifespan but especially in the years spanning from 40 until death, which I think for most people falls somewhere between 50, 60, 70, or ideally, out into the 80s and 90s or 100, right? That's what we're all seeking is to die later in better health. And in order to do that, we have to dedicate some very specific training protocols in order to maintain or build strength. So to summarize, in addition to all the positive reasons to do dedicated strength training that I mentioned before, it's highly recommended that you do some dedicated strength training for the purposes of offsetting the age-related decline in strength that occurs again 3% to 5% per year past age 40, which is a pretty significant decline. But the good news is if you do the 3 to 5 protocol for say 12 weeks per year, and then you continue to resistance train using other repetition ranges geared towards hypertrophy and strength or perhaps even muscular endurance, the good news is you'll maintain your strength and perhaps even build your strength, offsetting that natural decrease that would otherwise occur. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens now called AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. The next tool I'm about to describe relates to your cardiovascular training, and it's a tool that can greatly improve your cardiovascular fitness with a limited amount of time commitment. But that is not to say it is easy. What I'm referring to is the so-called Sugarcane. If you listened to the series with Dr. Andy Galpin, you may recall our discussion about the Sugarcane, which is so named after our friend and expert trainer Kenny Kane. And it is a very efficient yet somewhat brutal way to increase your cardiovascular output. So the Sugarcane is the type of protocol that you would incorporate once in the period of a week but certainly not every week. It's the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training. The Sugarcane involves selecting some form of exercise that you can do at high intensity safely. That, of course, will differ between individuals. For some of you it will be a stationary bike. For others of you, it will be a road bike. For others of you, it will be running. And for others of you, it will be rowing. The exact form of exercise is not important. What is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity. So you're going to be doing some sprint like work, although not all out sprints except on the final round. I'll explain where all this is going in a moment. But again, you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity. So for me that would be running, for you it might be something else. The Sugarcane is pretty straightforward in structure. It involves three rounds after a brief warm-up, of course. So you're going to do 3 to 5 minutes of jogging or jumping jacks or skipping rope, something to get your core body temperature up so that you're prepared to do the high-intensity work. And then there are only three rounds of high-intensity work. And they go as the following, in round 1, you're going to take 2 minutes-- so you'll need to set a timer for 2 minutes-- and you're going to go the maximum distance that you can in that 2 minutes. So run the maximum distance that you can for 2 minutes, or cycle the maximum distance that you can for 2 minutes, or VersaClimber the maximum distance that you can for 2 minutes. Whatever you select, you're going to do that as far and as fast as you can for the duration of 2 minutes. So depending on the movement and depending on your level of fitness, that distance might be 400m, 600m, 800m, et cetera. Whatever distance you travel in that 2 minutes, you are going to mark that distance down in your mind, or in your phone, or on a piece of paper. And then you're going to rest 2 minutes. So 2 minutes of work then rest 2 minutes. Then in round 2, you're going to go the same distance that you did in round 1, and you're going to take as much time as you need to do that distance as fast as you can. So if you went 600m in 2 minutes for round 1, in round 2 you're going to go 600m, and it's going to take you however long it takes you. Chances are if you really did the best you could in round 1, you were at maximum output for the first 2 minutes, that in round 2 it's going to take you longer than 2 minutes to travel that equivalent distance. However, there is the possibility that it will take you less time. But for most people, it's going to take you more time. So staying with this example of 600m in 2 minutes on round 1, in round 2, you're going to go 600m, let's say it takes you 2 minutes and 30s. You then are going to mark down how long round 2 took you. So in this case, the example is 2 minutes and 30s. Then you're going to rest another 2 minutes. And then in round 3, you're going to go all out again as fast and as safely as you can for the same duration that you did in round 2. And your goal is to go at least as far as you went in round 1. And if there's still time left, you're going to continue to go all out again as fast as you safely can until the entire duration is completed. So it's really just three rounds with two rest periods in between round 1 and round 3. And then I highly recommend that after round 3, that you do some sort of dedicated cooldown. So instead of just flopping on to the bench or the floor or the lawn, that you walk around slowly until you recover your breathing. The reason I like the sugarcane as a tool that one implements once every say two to four weeks as a replacement for one's typical high-intensity interval training is several fold. First of all, if you provide the right intensity in round 1 and round 2 and round 3, it is sure to elevate your heart rate substantially, and in doing so, improve your VO2 max, which is correlated with all sorts of important metrics related to health span, performance, and life span. Second of all, it gamifies things a little bit. It pits you against yourself in the sense that if you go out at maximum speed, again, performing a movement that you can safely perform at maximum speed in round 1, well, then you have something to compete against in round 2 and round 3. And that makes the high-intensity interval training, first of all, very intense, but also it makes it fun in a way that lets you forget just how painful the whole thing is. The next tool to improve your fitness is called exercise snacks and as the name suggests this is a fun one and was suggested by Dr. Andy Galpin as a way to either enhance or maintain your fitness depending on how your core or foundational fitness program is going. So when I say core I don't mean your abs. I mean whether or not you're getting your regular cardio and your regular resistance training if you were to add one or several of these exercise snacks per week. It can further improve things like VO2 max, muscular endurance, et cetera. I'll talk about the specific snacks that you will be doing in a moment. However, as Dr. Andy Galpin also pointed out, there are times in which we happen to not be following our foundational fitness program either because work demands or family demands or we're traveling. We're simply not keeping up with our basic routine. And under those conditions, exercise snacks are a terrific way to maintain the fitness that you've already built and developed, and you don't lose any ground in a week say where you get particularly busy. Now, exercise snacks can take on a variety of different forms. But for sake of simplicity and clarity, today we're going to divide them into two major categories. The first category are exercise snacks that are going to improve or maintain your cardiovascular fitness, so your ability to run or cycle or row some distance say 12 minutes or longer. But keep in mind these exercise snacks are very, very brief. They don't require that you do them for 12 minutes or longer. What they are going to do is either maintain or enhance the type of endurance that allows you to continue in an activity for 12 minutes or longer. The second category of exercise snack relates to muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is a very important aspect of fitness. And even though some people are already training for muscular endurance, it's something that most people are not doing enough training for. Muscular endurance is your ability say to maintain a wall set or to maintain a plank, or to do the maximum number of push-ups that you can do in one session. The sort of drop to the floor and give me as many push-ups as you possibly can type of thing, or as many sit-ups as you can type of thing. Muscular endurance translates to a number of other aspects of fitness, and it's something that we should all be working on. And again, many people just don't make space for it in their regular routine. So now we have these two categories of exercise snacks. One geared toward enhancing or maintaining your cardiovascular fitness as it translates to longer duration endurance activities, so 12 minutes or longer. And then the other category is purely muscular endurance, which is essentially some bout of exercise that's going to be fairly brief, anywhere from a minute to 2 minutes but certainly less than 12 minutes. OK, so let me give you an example of an exercise snack for enhancing your long-duration endurance, 12 minutes or longer. And this is the sort of thing that if you are going to incorporate into your routine, and I highly recommend that you do, can essentially be done any time with no warm-up. A good example of an exercise snack of this type would be to suddenly stand up from your desk and to do 100 jumping jacks. Now, depending on how fit you are and how fast you do those jumping jacks and how wide and tall you do those jumping jacks, meaning are you doing these little things where your hands don't actually meet and your hands like parting your legs just a little bit, or are you doing full jumping jacks where you're really jumping and setting your feet out as wide as you comfortably and safely can and then bring your hands together, it could take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds. OK. So in the case of jumping jacks, you may end up doing this for 90 seconds. But the point is to simply do 100 jumping jacks. Or if that takes too long, you could even do just 25 or 50 jumping jacks. The point is that it's going to get you moving your muscles. It's going to get your heart rate up. Even if you're very, very fit if you're doing these fast enough and you're doing them with proper form, it's going to get your heart rate up. And then you're done. You can sit back down to your desk or you can continue to walk through the airport. Yes, I've done these in the airport. Typically not while walking toward my gate but at the gate. But occasionally I'm feeling lethargic, or I haven't had the opportunity to train that day, and perhaps I won't get the opportunity to train, so I'll do something like 100 jumping jacks while facing the window so it feels a little less awkward facing people while you're doing them. And of course, you don't have to do jumping jacks. And equally effective type of exercise snack is to find a stairwell and to simply go up that stairwell as fast as you safely can for 20 to 30 seconds. So perhaps just find the bottom of a stairwell and go up that stairwell as quickly as you can. And perhaps go down as quickly as you can. And just keep doing that for about 20 to 40 seconds, and then you're essentially done. OK. You could also opt to pick some distance away from your car in the parking lot, assuming you're not carrying any heavy bags or anything, and simply run to your car. So 20 to 30 seconds of not necessarily all out sprinting. You don't want to injure yourself. Because again, this is done without a warm-up. These exercise snacks are designed to be inserted into your day and into your week essentially at random. You could plan them if you want. But any time you feel inspired, or perhaps any time you're feeling like you don't want to do one, you could simply do one of these exercise snacks. And of course, doing jumping jacks, or running to your car, or taking the stairs very quickly up and down, or just up and then walking down, for instance, and doing a few jumping jacks, things of that sort, of course, can take on a near infinite number of different variations. So if you don't like any of the variations that I just presented, you can easily come up with something else. Again, the purpose of these exercise snacks is to get your heart rate up. It's of course, to do this while not getting injured, and it is entirely compatible with an existing exercise program. It in no way is going to impede your performance in strength or hypertrophy or other forms of long-form endurance or high-intensity interval training, quite to the contrary. Everything we know about these exercise snacks is that they enhance various aspects of your physiology in ways that promote both recovery and performance in your other types of exercise and your other types of athletic endeavors. So no reason to think that they are going to be problematic for your training. But of course, don't trip, don't fall, don't undertake a movement that puts you into a range of motion that has hurting your back, your knee, or any other part of your body. Start off slowly and find something that really works for you. So these are very easy. They take very little time. They're fun to be honest. And as was discussed in the conversation with Dr. Andy Galpin, they're also very effective. The second category of exercise snack are the exercise snacks that enhance muscular endurance. So muscular endurance is the type of endurance that allows you to maintain a fixed position for some period of time usually somewhere between 1 and 3 minutes. But these endurance bouts are never going to last 12 or more minutes, unless you are exceptionally evolved in terms of your muscular endurance abilities. What I'm talking about here are things like planks, wall sits, maximum number of push-ups, things of that sort. And this is an aspect of fitness that translates to other aspects of fitness in a very important way. And again, this was covered in the exercise series with Dr. Andy Galpin. I don't want to go into any of the details now because it was all covered there. It's very easy to look up because it's time stamped. But just being brief, muscular endurance allows the buildup of more microvascular supply to muscles and connective tissue in a way that allows delivery and removal of more nutrients and waste products. Now, I realize to the physios things like nutrients and waste products is far too broad a category, but what we're talking about here is the ability to deliver more fuel and oxygen and to remove waste products of muscular effort, or to be more specific, neuromuscular effort. This is a great thing because it can help you enhance your strength training, enhance your hypertrophy training, enhance your long-distance endurance and your middle distance and even your short distance endurance. And these exercise snacks for building muscular endurance are exceedingly easy to do. And you can even do them while talking on the phone, especially if you're using headphones, or if you have your phone on speaker. A good example of an exercise snack for muscular endurance would be a 30 to 60-second or perhaps longer wall sit. So remember wall sits? Wall sits are as the name suggests where you put your feet out some distance from a wall. You squat down into a seated position, but there's no chair there, and then you maintain that seated position, and that is harder to do over time. You could lean back against the wall a little bit harder if you wanted to gain some extra support and continue. But the idea here is that you're going to go not necessarily to muscular failure but to the point where you can't continue to sit in that wall sit position. You could also simply do this as an air squat down to the bottom position where you're comfortable. And then you don't want to rest down there, and you want to maintain some tension in your quadriceps and other muscles of your lower body so that you're actively trying to support yourself in the seated position but without a seat below you. That can be done again while on a speakerphone conversation, that can be done at random throughout the day. You can just decide, OK, I'm going to do a wall sit now, and I'm going to time myself. I'm going to see how long I can do this for. Or you could decide to do a plank. I've done this while on a phone call. Sorry if it was that I was talking to, but I've put the phone on speaker and just gotten into a plank position, and then I'll just have the conversation in the plank position. I don't fight to maintain that plank position past the point where I could continue to have a conversation. So again, this is a type of exercise that one is trying to incorporate into their daily routine. If you wanted to dedicate a specific amount of time just to doing these exercise snacks, you could. But it's far more reasonable to assume that people will incorporate these into their daily routine more regularly if you can incorporate it truly into the other aspects your routine like work. You do this while watching TV, or listening to a podcast. One form of muscular endurance exercise snack that's really terrific and is a bit of a challenge, that's fun is to just simply see how many push-ups you can do. And we talked about proper push-up form during the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin, but here what we're talking about is chest all the way to the ground so it touches the ground, then pushing up until your arms are completely straight. That's one push-up. And then continuing in piston-like fashion, meaning you're not pausing at the top and taking a bunch of breaths. You're not going into a plank position in other words but continuing to do as many push-ups as you can to see whether or not you can enhance that number over time. And in any case, just to simply get your body working to engage the muscles of your chest, your shoulders, your triceps, and your core, et cetera, and to do that every once in a while. So instead of needing somebody to say drop and give me 20, just see whether or not at some point, any point throughout the day, you can get into a push-up position and do your maximum number of push-ups, and then just mentally note that number to yourself. Again, these exercise snacks serve multiple roles. They're designed to get you moving, to get your heart rate going, to maintain or enhance your fitness in other domains of fitness. And this is very important to not take too much time out of your schedule. In fact, like zone 2 cardio, right, being the type of movement that you're just going to do a lot throughout the week carrying groceries, et cetera, as we discussed earlier, these exercise snacks are designed to be incorporated into your daily life. And I must say that having started doing these after recording the series with Dr. Andy Galpin, I've noticed two things. First of all, including these exercise snacks at least once a week and more like three to five times a week for me, so that's one exercise snack done three to five times per week has definitely correlated with improvements in my fitness in other domains of fitness, strength, hypertrophy, long-distance endurance, et cetera. Now, I've changed a number of other things as well as a consequence of that series with Dr. Andy Galpin. So I can't say for sure that it's the exercise snacks per se that are causing all those positive shifts. I have to imagine that it's not just the exercise snacks, but they've become an important part of my routine and that relates to the second point, which is that the exercise snacks are to be fun and easy. And so I really enjoy them, so much so that if I don't one for couple of days, I start to crave them a little bit like the other kind of snack. The next category of tool to improve your fitness relates to breathing or respiration. Now breathing and respiration is an enormous topic in and of itself. In fact, I did an entire episode on breathing and respiration, and this is a topic that my laboratory works on extensively as it relates to anxiety control and some other aspects of mental health, as well as to physical performance. For today's discussion, I want to just review a few tools that one can incorporate both into workouts and around workouts that can greatly enhance fitness and recovery. The first one is the type of respiration tool that you use between sets of exercise. And again here we're talking about resistance training, but we could just as easily be talking about rest between rounds of say high-intensity interval training. So for instance, between bouts of sprinting on the track or the bike or the treadmill or the rower. A great pattern of breathing to incorporate during rest between sets is something that I've talked about before in other contexts which is the physiological side. The physiological side is a deep Inhale through the nose to maximally or near maximally inflate your lungs, and then a second very brief inhale, and it's necessarily brief because your lungs are already pretty full, to maximally inflate your lungs and to make sure that any of the little sacs or the little alveoli of your lungs that have collapsed during the exercise exertion will reinflate. And then a long exhale until lungs empty. So I'll demonstrate it right now as I've done many times before. But if you haven't seen it or heard it before, it's two inhales followed by an extended exhale. And it goes like this. [INHALE, EXHALE] You'll notice that the inhales were through the nose and the exhale was through the mouth. That's the ideal way to do it for a number of reasons. Check out the episode that I did on respiration physiology a.k.a. breathing if you want more details on why that is. But two inhales through the nose and a long extended exhale through the mouth, the so-called physiological side not named by me but rather named by physiologists in the 1930 is as far as we know, the fastest way to shift your nervous system from so-called sympathetic drive to more parasympathetic drive, from a state of greater alertness to a state of greater calm. Now, the reason to do this between sets of resistance training is that the more that you can shift yourself from sympathetic drive to parasympathetic drive, that is from alert to calm in between sets, the more energy and focus you can devote to exertion during your work sets. So one way to do this that's very convenient and very effective is to consider the last repetition of your set, a physiological sigh, which is not to say, OK, I want to be very clear, which is not to say that you should do the physiological side during your set. In fact, I recommend that you do not do that. But rather if you're doing six repetitions of a given exercise and you, let's say, fail on the sixth or you do that sixth repetition and you're just close to failure because again your work set should be to failure or close to it most of the time, then set down the weight, and then you're going to do the next repetition as the physiological sigh, meaning you're not going to do the movement. You're going to think of doing a physiological sigh as the last repetition of every set, not during the last repetition of the resistance training movement, OK. So the physiological sigh is something you do at the beginning of the rest period immediately following a set. If you'd rather think about it that way because it's more convenient than thinking about it as the last rep of a set, be my guest. Whatever works for you. But what you'll quickly find is that if you do a physiological sigh right after completing your last repetition, you'll calm down much more quickly, your heart rate will come down more quickly, and you'll recover more completely in whatever designated rest period you've allowed yourself, whether or not it's 30 seconds, which would be very short frankly, or it's a 5-minute period of rest between sets. If you do one truly, just one physiological sigh at the beginning of the rest period, you are going to effectively shift your nervous system in the direction you want it to go during those rest periods. And of course, if you're training hard during your work sets you run zero risk whatsoever of feeling so calm that you don't feel motivated to do your next set. I promise you that it will allow you to relax more at the beginning of the rest period than you ordinarily would, to shift into a state of rest. There are differing opinions about whether or not you should walk around or stay still during your rest periods. I like to walk around a bit and stay standing. I'm not one of these people that collapses into a C-shape on the bench in between sets. I like to stand up and breathe normally and walk around, drink a little water, et cetera. In any case, doing a physiological side the beginning of each rest interval between work sets of resistance training is a very effective way to enhance your focus and your output during your work sets. Now, the last respiration tool to improve your fitness is again a tool gleaned from the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin, and that's to include a 3 to 5 minute period at the end of every single workout. So it doesn't matter if it's high-intensity interval training, or it's resistance training, or it's a long run of some sort, at the end of every workout, to take 3 to 5 minutes, so you'll want to set a timer, and to do some form of parasympathetic, that is calming promoting breathing in order to shift your nervous system from a state of heightened alertness and output into a state of recovery. Because as you all well know by now, you get fitter not during your workouts but rather after your workouts, in between workouts. So you stimulate the adaptation during a workout, but you get the adaptation, you get the actual improvement in between workouts. And a common mistake that many people make, and I made this mistake for years, was to finish a great workout, and then you're texting on your phone, or you're talking on the phone, or you're driving home. It's certainly not as intense as the workout that you just did. Maybe you're even feeling really calm from a nice long jog, or you had a particularly good workout that day and you're feeling really happy. So you're enjoying the high, so to speak, well, when you do 3 to 5 minutes of what's often called down regulation breathing after a workout, it allows you to recover and to induce the adaptation that you've been after, the one that you actually trained for much more quickly. I can't tell you how many people I know who start to incorporate this into their workouts, find that they recover far better from their workouts, which might seem a little bit surprising. Why would it be that just 3 to 5 minutes of some activity would enhance recovery to such a great degree? And that's because typically people don't bookend their workouts. They finish their workouts, and of course, they're not continuing to lift weights or run. But they move about their day in their life even if it's preparing a meal in a way that the level of stress, and therefore, stress hormones, things like cortisol, adrenaline, things that by the way are excellent to elevate during a workout, things like inflammatory markers, which by the way, are great to enhance during a workout. That actually happens during a workout. You have a massive increase in inflammatory markers, which might seem bad, but all of those things are enhancing the adaptation that you're seeking. But as soon as those workouts end, you want to shift into recovery mode. And this 3 to 5 minutes of down regulation breathing is a terrific way to do that. There are a couple of different patterns of breathing that will work best, but all of them emphasize exhales. OK. I want to repeat that, all of them emphasize exhales. So for instance, you could just choose slow, deliberate breathing. How does that emphasize exhales? Well, ordinarily when we breathe, we inhale actively and we exhale passively. Whenever we deliberately breathe more slowly, we are actively exhaling. OK, so active exhales really promote the calming response in brain and body. The other thing you could do which many people are now doing is to do a repeated round of physiological sighs. So the double inhale through the nose, long exhale through the mouth but repeated for say 3 minutes. That's another version. The other thing you could do is simply to notice your exhales and to emphasize your exhales, make them longer and more vigorous than your inhales. Now, you don't want to turn this into a breathwork session where you're-- [INHALE,EXHALE] --you're doing it Pranayama or Kundalini breathing or something of that sort. The idea is to calm down. So any time you're extending your exhales, you're actively exhaling, you're trying to slow your breathing down overall, you're going to shift yourself in the right direction. So rather than complicate this type of tool, the best thing you can do is just focus on those exhales, slow your breathing overall, use physiological sighs if you want, or simply sit in your vehicle, or if you have to drive home while doing this extended exhale type of down regulation. Ideally you would take a couple of minutes and just shift your whole system by not driving, closing your eyes and just sitting in your car stationary, of course, don't drive with your eyes closed, or bike with your eyes closed. Just simply calm down, extend your exhales and shift from the workout to the recovery mode, which is where the progress is going to arrive. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, et cetera mean and behavioral supplement, nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health. InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both ApoB and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. The next tool is to improve your fitness are psychological tools, and they're really geared toward enhancing your focus during your workout and separating or segmenting your workouts from the other parts of your day. Now, of course, workouts are naturally segmented from the other parts of your day, unless you're running around all day long, or you're lifting weights or other heavy objects all day long. But one of the more attractive tools that was presented during the series with Dr. Galpin that I adopted and found to be really effective is this concept of the line. The line is this concept that you have a physical location, say at the entrance to a gym or at the start of your run or your bike or maybe it's around the stationary exercise device that you use for which once you cross that line, you are all about business. OK. You're not socializing or at least not too much. You don't want to be rude to people, but you're really focused on your workout. So this is especially effective on days when you're a little bit distracted, or you didn't sleep that well the night before, or maybe you've got something going on in your mind, or you're in an argument, or you're excited about something else. But if you care about your fitness, which I hope everyone does, and your goal during any workout is to stimulate a particular type of physiological adaptation strength, hypertrophy, long-distance endurance, et cetera, and you also don't want to get injured so that you can continue to train for your entire life as regularly as possible, the concept of the line is fantastic because what it does is it forces you to compartmentalize the portion of your lesson that comes before the workout and after the workout and also to really enjoy your workouts. This is something that's not often discussed, but nowadays with the advent of smartphones, there's a lot of infiltration of other types of communication and information while one is supposed to be exercising. And so our life has become far less compartmentalized than it used to be before the advent of smartphones. Now, of course, smartphones are wonderful. They provide all sorts of wonderful tools and benefits, and of course, I use one. And I'll talk about how to incorporate the smartphone in a very specific way to enhance your workouts in just a moment. But the idea of a line is you pick a location. It can change with each workout, but ideally it would be at the threshold of where the physical location to the workout begins. And once you cross that line, you are all business. You are taking care of business. Which is not to say that you can't enjoy your workouts. In fact, you absolutely should. One of the best pieces of advice that I ever got about fitness was given to me when I was a teenager and I started lifting weights. And the person who was teaching me how to do that said, one of the best things that you can do and you absolutely should do for your fitness now and forever is to learn to enjoy training hard. And that really stuck with me. I really do enjoy training hard, but that was something that I learned how to do over time. I took on the mentality that I'm here by choice, I'm here for my own good and my own fitness to enhance my life so I'm going to enjoy training hard, I'm going to enjoy training effectively. And of course, there are days when I train a little less hard or I back off quite a bit. I even take rest periods of a week every once in a while, every say 12 to 16 weeks I'll take a week off and just do some activities like hiking and things of that sort. I talk to all about extended layoffs, meaning a layoff of more than two days during the episode that I did by myself, which is the Optimal Fitness protocols episode. But in any case, learning to train hard and enjoy training hard and really making the workout something that is separate from the rest of your life is one of the most gratifying things that you can do to enhance your overall fitness because it really teaches you how to designate your mind and your body toward this one specific set of goals while you are there and to really enjoy the process because fitness can be a truly enjoyable process even when you are exerting yourself, especially hard. And for you masochists out there, it can be, especially because you're training hard that it feels so good. In any event, the key is to set some sort of boundary and know that when you cross into that boundary, you're training. And when you cross out of that boundary, you're done training, which also lends itself to more adequate recovery and the decompression type breathing exercises that we talked about before. I'm not going to tell you whether or not you need to do the down regulation breathing at the end of your workout within the line or after you cross the line. That's up to you. I don't think one needs to get that specific. Now, another tool that's wonderfully effective not just for your workouts but for all areas of your life is if you are going to bring a smartphone to your workouts, to set some boundaries around what you're going to listen to and do with that smartphone during your workouts. I see people texting. I see people doing selfies. I see people having phone calls. I see people, I presume, listening to music or podcasts. Look, I am not the smartphone police nor are you, and everyone has a right to use their smartphone in the way that they choose as best for them in order to distract themselves or focus themselves or enrich their life. Look, it's a free world, of course, more for some than for others, but you can do what you want with your smartphone. However, if your goal is to improve your fitness, one of the more powerful things you can do with your smartphone is to decide before you cross the line into your workout what you're going to listen to or do with that phone or not. So for me, I like to designate a playlist of music for that particular workout, and then I just stick to that playlist. I might repeat songs that I like a lot, or if someone talks to me while the music is playing, I might go back and restart a song if they distracted me, that sort of thing. Although, I do my best to not get into too much social chit chat during workouts, but I'm friendly, and it's nice when people come over and say hello. I sometimes work out with other people in which case I don't use headphones, I don't use a smartphone. But setting a playlist or two, designating a podcast or two, designating an audiobook or two, whatever it is that you're going to listen to really decide what that's going to be before you do your workout. And the reason I say this is that I observe a lot of people, and frankly, I've observed myself under conditions where I'm suddenly in a text communication, or I'm bouncing between albums or between podcasts or between whatever it is on the phone to the point where rest intervals aren't being controlled well, to the point where focus during sets becomes harder to achieve at the beginning of a set because in between sets I was focused on a conversation not on training. I'm a big believer in making your exercise fun, making it accessible, meaning not so expensive or geographically difficult to achieve that you don't do it or that it starts to interfere with other areas of life. This is really important. You want fitness to be blended with the rest of your life, but you don't want it so blended with the rest of your life that the rest of your life starts to impede your efforts. Or and this happens quite often for a lot of people that workouts start to take an hour and a half, two hours when they could easily be completed in 45 minutes to an hour if you were just more efficient with your time. And of course, you don't need me to tell you this, but smartphones can be one of the major bleeds on our focus and efficiency. In fact, it can cause you to hemorrhage focus and efficiency. So what I'm suggesting here is not throwing away your smartphone, although, some people do benefit from just leaving it in the car or at home when they are training. But rather to designate podcasts, books, music playlists for that particular workout and to just stick to those for the duration of your workout. And once you cross into the line, that's what you're listening to and only that or nothing. And of course, once you cross back over the line as you finish your workout, you can decide to continue to listen to the podcast, or continue to listen to the audiobook, or to the music. That's up to you. Although, I highly recommend that you do incorporate that downregulation period of 3 to 5 minutes minimum. The last category of tools to improve your fitness come from the discussions about nutrition and supplementation and recovery in the series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Now, the list of tools I'm about to describe is not exhaustive, meaning it doesn't even begin to come close to the total number of tools that one could glean from the discussion about nutrition and supplementation that I had with Dr. Andy Galpin on this podcast, but they are the major ones that are definitely worth knowing. And those include supplementing with omega 3 fatty acids. Now, omega 3 fatty acids are found of course in foods, things like fatty fish and krill, of all things, certain forms of algae, et cetera. But most people do not get enough of so-called EPA form of omega 3s. And for that reason, I and many other people choose to supplement with a minimum of 1 gram per day and in some cases as high as 2 grams per day of omega 3s in supplement form. So typically one would get to 1 to 2 grams of EPA by supplementing their nutrition, their diet, that is, with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil. There are many different sources of these. That was discussed in an episode that I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. I find that it's most cost efficient to get that 1 to 2 grams of EPAs from liquid fish oil despite what you might see on the internet. I don't have any relationship whatsoever to a liquid fish oil company. You just want to make sure that you go with a reputable brand. I like the ones that are flavored with lemon so that it offsets the taste of fish oil, and I'll take a tablespoon or two of that per day. And if I'm traveling and even if I'm not I will often use fish oil capsules, and there are a variety of different sources of those as well. Getting sufficient amounts of omega 3 has been shown to be important for mood. So as a way to offset depression but also for enhancing overall mood that probably relates to the omega 3s effect on neurotransmission, not just for neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine but for all neurotransmission. And neurotransmission, of course, is essential for neuromuscular performance. And the omega 3s have been implicated in reducing the inflammation response, cardiovascular health, et cetera. I realized that there is some debate about omega 3s, but when I look at the bulk of literature about the omega 3s, it's very clear to me that getting 1 to 2 grams of EPA form of omega 3 per day is the right thing for me to do. And many others find that as well. The second tool to enhance your fitness under this category of nutrition and supplementation is creatine. Now, again, creatine is not just found in supplement form. It's also found, of course, in foods, in particular red meat. However, the amount of red meat that one would have to eat in order to get the amount of creatine that one would start to see a real performance enhancing effect is just far too high. You'd be ingesting far too much of other things in red meat that you wouldn't want that much of. And for that reason, I and many other people will take creatine daily. We now know there's no need to so-called load creatinine in the old days as it were. So old days, by the way, meaning mid '90s and 2000s, we were all told that we had to load creatine, we had to take high-dose creatine for four or five days and then you could back off to a maintenance dose. Now it's very clear you can just take a daily dose of creatine. And that it really doesn't matter when you take that creatine. You can take it post-workout as many people do. You can take it preworkout. It really doesn't seem to matter. I happen to take it postworkout just as a matter of habit. But again, you can take it any time of day. Now, the point I want to make about creatine is one that's a bit different than the other discussions out there. I have no issue with the majority of what's discussed about creatine out there, for instance, that creatine monohydrate is the most effective form. Fortunately, creatine monohydrate is also the least expensive form of creatine that's sold out there. I see no evidence whatsoever that the other forms of creatine are superior to creatine monohydrate. But what you'll usually hear is that taking 5 grams of creatine monohydrate per day is ideal for everybody. And that advice is simply not well-informed by the scientific literature. If you are a larger person, so for instance I weigh 100kg so that's about 220 pounds, well, it turns out if you look at the literature on creatine and athletic performance, and if you look at the literature on creatine and cognitive performance, because as some of you already know, creatine is a fuel or the phosphocreatine system is a fuel system for the brain as well. And if you look at the studies on creatine, they almost always gauge the amount of creatine to give an individual based on their body weight. So you don't have to get really specific about this, but if you weigh, say, 185 pounds to 250 pounds, you can get away with and probably should be taking 10 grams or so of creatine per day, which is what I do. Whereas if you weigh less than that, 5 grams or maybe even 3 grams is sufficient. Now, I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin during that series, and one of the things that I've started to do since the closure of that series is to take more creatine per day. So now I'm taking 10, sometimes even as much as 15 grams per day of creatine. Again, this is powdered creatine monohydrate. My stomach tolerates it very well, but frankly, I don't tend to get stomach aches or gastric distress from pretty much anything, unless it's some form of food poisoning, which is exceedingly rare for me. So some people out there find that creatine really disrupts their gut, and they need to take it with food or they really need to slowly and increase the amount of creatine that they're taking each day. I find that I can put 10 even 15 grams of creatine into a whey protein shake or into some water with a little bit of lemon juice, just to make it taste a little less chalky, drink that, and I don't have any gastric distress from that. So you'll need to find what works for you. But the point here is if you're going to take creatine, you don't just want to quote unquote, "take creatine one scoop per day." You really want to adjust the amount of creatine that you're ingesting according to your body weight. And I would give you a very specific formula of x grams of creatine per kilogram or pound of body weight, but believe it or not, no such specific recommendation has ever been published in the scientific literature or at least I couldn't find it in a way that's consistent with all the other papers, meaning you see a lot of variation. So what I'm talking about here is if you weigh 185 pounds or so, OK, plus or minus 5 pounds out to about 250 pounds, 10 to 15g of creatine per day is probably more appropriate for you than is 5 grams, meaning it's going to be more effective for enhancing physical performance. And perhaps again, perhaps even cognitive performance as well. And if you're somebody who weighs 180 pounds down to say 130 pounds, 5 grams of creatine per day is probably sufficient. The point here is if you are taking creatine, again, not everyone has to take creatine. There's no law that says that you have to take creatine. Some people don't like it. I know some people fear it's going to make their hair fall out. We already talked about that in previous episodes and the lack of data to support that idea. But I realize some people steer away from creatine for whatever reason. But if you decide that taking creatine is right for you, adjust the total amount of creatine that you take according to your body weight. The next supplementation based tool for enhancing your fitness is a Rhodiola rosea. Now, this very esoteric sounding supplement is one that I learned about, both from Dr. Lane Norton when he was a guest on this podcast, expert in nutrition and frankly training as it relates to resistance training, and from Dr. Andy Galpin. Rhodiola rosea is a supplement that's gaining increasing attention because it is what's called a cortisol modulator. It does not necessarily suppress cortisol. It does not increase cortisol. It's a cortisol modulator. And frankly, the mechanism by which Rhodiola rosea modulates cortisol is still under investigation. I hope to do an episode about it in the future or at least make it part of an episode because the hypothesized mechanism that's starting to emerge is really interesting as it relates to neurons in the brain that control the stress response and glands in the body like the adrenals that control the stress response and that secrete cortisol. Regardless, there's a growing body of research that has explored Rhodiola rosea supplementation and one's subjective perception of fatigue or output during high-intensity training of various kinds, both resistance training as well as running and endurance type training. So I started taking Rhodiola rosea about six months ago in response to conversations that I had again with Dr. Lane Norton and with Dr. Andy Galpin, and it's a supplement that I take before high-intensity workouts. So I don't take it before a run because frankly my runs are either very long and slow, or they're very brief like a high-intensity interval training session. And I find those to be pretty easy to recover from even though they are very intense. I might take a Rhodiola rosea supplement before doing a 30-minute hill run that's very intense. But typically, I only take it about 10 to 15 minutes before any sort of high-intensity resistance training session, in particular my leg day which falls on day 2 of my exercise protocol, or the torso day, or the small body parts day. Again, here I'm referencing the way that I train across the week, and you can find that training protocol as a downloadable completely zero-cost if you like. But I realize other people are using different body part splits and different combinations of resistance training and endurance training. The reason I mentioned Rhodiola rosea in this episode is that I realized that while some people might not yet be supplementing omega 3s, they might not be supplementing creatine, there are many of you who are already doing those things, and you're looking for additional tools to give you an edge. So again, the Rhodiola rosea would not fall into the category of foundational supplements. Certainly, get your nutrition right, get your sleep right, get your sunlight. All the basics first please before even thinking about any supplements. However, once you get into the category of supplements that can enhance fitness, Rhodiola rosea does seem to have some good research to support it in the context of lots of different forms of high-intensity exercise. Now, I can't tell you whether or not it's purely subjective or whether or not it's objective and subjective, but my experience has been that when I take Rhodiola rosea I definitely notice that I can exert myself harder without feeling like I'm bringing myself to the brink of fatigue either during the exertion or afterwards. In other words, I feel like I can do more work without feeling so exhausted, and I feel as if I'm recovering from my workouts more quickly, in particular across the day after my workouts. In fact, if I had to cite one specific subjective effect that I've experienced from taking Rhodiola rosea before very high-intensity workouts is that prior to taking it, I would often find that 3 or 4 hours after the workout having eaten a good meal, taking a shower, et cetera, and I was tired. I'd have a real dip in energy. But now I notice that I have a lot of energy throughout the day even after these very high-intensity sessions in the early part of the day. And frankly, I haven't changed anything else about my supplementation or my nutrition, at least nothing major. So I personally am going to continue to take Rhodiola rosea before these high-intensity workouts. So for me, that's about two or three times per week. However, if I forgot to take Rhodiola rosea before a workout, I have no reason to think that workout would go much worse. This is a supplement that is designed to give you an edge to be able to exert more focus and intensity during your workouts with less perceived exertion and to enhance your recovery. The typical dosage of Rhodiola rosea that you'll find in most supplements is 100 to 200 milligrams. And of course, any time you're going to take a new supplement, you would be wise to figure out the lowest effective dose from that supplement. That's just logic, right? Why spend more money taking more of something that you don't need more of if you could get away with taking less of it, and it's just as effective maybe even more effective? So I typically will take 100 to 200 milligrams of Rhodiola rosea about 10 to 20 minutes before a workout. However, I've taken as little as 100 milligrams on a consistent basis, and frankly, I don't really experience much difference whether I take 100mg or I take 200 milligrams before a workout, so lately I've just defaulted to taking 100 milligrams of Rhodiola rosea before any high-intensity workout. Now, the final tool that I want to review for improving your fitness comes from the category of nutrition. I've done lots of episodes about nutrition already on this podcast. We've done episodes about intermittent fasting I did a long interview episode with Dr. Lane Norton where we discussed all the ins and outs of nutrition as it relates to fat loss, muscle gain, fitness in general, lifestyle in general. So check out that episode where you will learn his philosophy on nutrition, which frankly is the one that I largely subscribe to. And of course, obeys the laws of thermodynamics, calories in, calories out being fundamentally important. But also gets into all sorts of details about which sources of protein are most effective and bioavailable, how much protein you can incorporate into your muscles after training, et cetera, all of that is included in that episode. With that said, the series on exercise with Dr. Andy Galpin also included an episode on nutrition. And while having the discussion for that episode and then listening to that episode again, I realized that while certainly I've gotten a number of things right about my nutrition across the years, there are a few areas where I could probably do better without much effort in ways that could really enhance my fitness. And the thing that I'm referring to is that for me my first meal of the day laying somewhere around 11:00 AM maybe 12:00 noon. Sometimes I'll eat an earlier breakfast, but most typically I hydrate, caffeinate, and train in the morning, and then I eat some time around 11:00 or 12:00. And then I eat my last meal of the day sometime around 8:30 or 9:00. And as some of you already know, I tend to organize my meals, such that meals during the early part of the day tend to lean more toward protein and fibrous carbohydrates, so things like meat and salad, or chicken and salad, fish and salad, and maybe a little bit of starch. And the meals that I eat later in the day tend to be more starch focused and more vegetable focused or things like pasta, rice, et cetera, later in the day because it helps me sleep. And the architecture of all that is really about energy and focus. I find I can focus a bit better and I have more energy throughout the day when I have my first meal at around 11:00 or 12:00, and I keep the total amount of carbohydrates that I ingest during the day moderate. Not low but moderate. Now, there is an exception to that, which is if I do a high-intensity resistance training session early in the morning say train legs or train torso or even small body parts early in the morning, then I make sure to incorporate more starchy carbohydrates and some fruit, some simple sugars as well into the first meal of the day so that I can replenish the glycogen that I depleted during those high-intensity resistance training sessions. However, after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin, I realized that I really shouldn't worry about or be afraid of eating something before training if I'm really hungry in the morning. So what I'm referring to here are the times in which I wake up and I want to train, but I personally like to train fasted and caffeinated. OK. Yes, I do recommend that people delay their caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking if and only if you have trouble with an afternoon crash, real fatigue in the afternoon, then it makes sense to delay your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However, the exception to that is that if I'm going to train early in the day, I do ingest water to hydrate as well as electrolytes and caffeine prior to training. And sometimes that means I'm drinking caffeine within 30 minutes or 60 minutes of waking. I've tried to be clear about this in previous episodes, but I think a number of people have come to think that I always delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, and that's simply not the case. If I'm going to train, in particular if I'm going to do high-intensity resistance training or a long run, I will ingest caffeine sooner than 90 to 120 minutes after waking. And in addition to that, yes, I tend to eat my first meal around 11:00 AM maybe 12:00 noon. But if I wake up and I'm very hungry, I will eat a small meal that includes typically some protein and some fat, so some Brazil nuts, maybe a couple of scoops of whey protein would be typical for me, or maybe even a little bit of oatmeal, some whey protein, not a lot of food in my gut. But after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin, what I learned was for some people training fasted feels best. I would consider myself one of those people. You may be somebody in that category as well, or you might be somebody who really feels as if you run best, you resistance train best when you've eaten say 90 minutes or a couple of hours before you do that. There are basically no specific rules as it relates to whether or not you train fasted or train fed except in what you can handle in terms of gastric distress. So you want to make food choices according to that and try and avoid, of course, gastric distress. But basically the change that I've made is if I wake up and I'm hungry, I'll eat a small meal, or if I want to work out in the afternoon or I have to work out in the afternoon and I have lunch at say, 12:00 or 12:30 or 11:00 AM and the only opportunity that I have to train is 1:00 PM or even 12:30, I will go ahead and train. And that's a new thing for me. Typically, I try to keep my meals at least three to four hours prior to any training bout. And of course, if you're sleeping all night, you're not eating, and then if you wake up and you don't eat and you train in the morning, that's certainly longer than three or four hours unless you're sleeping very, very little frankly. So essentially what I'm saying is figure out what works best for you. Do you prefer to train fasted or fed? For some of you, you might prefer fasted before cardio and fed before resistance training. For some of you, it might be fasted is always best. Again, I put myself in that category. For some of you, it might be fed is always best. Again, this is highly individual. And that's another point that I'm trying to make here, which is Dr. Galpin really impressed upon me that there is no hard and fast rule about training fasted or fed. And, this is the second point, that having some flexibility in whether or not you can train fasted or fed allows you to incorporate your fitness training sessions more readily into a shifting schedule. And that's a really overarching theme of everything we've been discussing today, which is yes, it's wonderful and important to have a core fitness program, something that you're really striving to do each and every week. And for me, that's three sessions of cardio, three resistance training sessions, and a day where I'm doing thermal stress training, which is just fancy language for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure. However, real life happens, travel, work, illness, family, all those sorts of things that can impinge on an exercise schedule and make it less likely that one would complete their workouts. So today we've been discussing tools to improve your fitness which are brief, easy to incorporate, scientifically supported, and that are shown to improve the various sorts of exercise adaptations and recovery that will allow you to get the most progress from your schedule. So while the tools that we discussed today relate to breathing, they relate to nutrition, they relate to supplementation, they relate to specific set and rep patterns and cadences and rest periods, et cetera, all of those specific recommendations are within a larger container that I hope has become clear, which is the best tools to improve your fitness are the tools that are, of course, are going to be effective in improving your cardiovascular and strength and hypertrophy training, et cetera, whatever it is that your goals are, but also tools that are going to make it easier and more likely that you are going to engage in your fitness program with enthusiasm, with effort, and with focus. And as with any episode of this podcast, I covered a lot of information, and there are a lot of different tools that one could incorporate. By no means do you need to incorporate them all. Although, if you choose to, that's wonderful. Just even incorporating one or two of them, say incorporating this notion of the line and the exercise snacks, or adjusting your level of flexibility as to whether or not you train fasted or fed and the line, or trying a 12-week cycle of purely training for strength when you do your resistance training. But whether or not you pick one tool or all the tools or somewhere in between, the key thing is to actually implement them. And I like to think that during today's discussion provided a number of tools, again, largely gleaned from the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin. And again, if you haven't seen that series, that's linked in the show note captions. Those episodes are long. There are six of them, but they are a wealth of information of every aspect of fitness. During today's episode, we're really just talking about the things that you can and I do believe should bring to your existing fitness program that can really make a positive difference without a lot of effort.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Jeffrey Goldberg Dr Jeffrey Goldberg is the chair of the Department of Opthalmology at Stanford University School of Medicine he is a clinician an MD or medical doctor who sees patients every week as well as a PhD meaning a laboratory scientist who directs his own laboratory focused at understanding the mechanisms and cures for diseases of the eye EnV Vision such as glaucoma retinitis Pigmentosa and macular degeneration indeed Dr Goldberg is one of the world leaders in developing methods to cure blindness he is also intensely knowledgeable about all things related to Vision so during today's discussion we indeed cover most all of visual and Eye Health you will learn for instance about the benefits as well as draw backs of wearing corrective lenses such as contact lenses or eyeglasses for reading you will learn about the benefits and detriments of sunlight meaning how it can help your vision in fact how it can help reverse or prevent myopia nearsightedness as well as the things to be cautious about with respect to sunlight in terms of development of cataracts which are occlusions that prevent Vision we also discuss many tools for maintaining and improving Vision across the lifespan r ranging from behavioral tools so specific Vision tasks and exercises for the eye that you can do that are known to improve or maintain your vision as well as specific surgical procedures such as lasic surgery we get into all the details of for instance how often to do these various eye exercises how long the benefits are maintained as well as age related considerations for things like lasc eye surgery we even get into how to best clean your contact lenses whether or not to use disposable contact lenses or other forms of contact lenses we also discuss things like dry eye and the best remedies for dry eye and we talk about the scientific and clinical data around nutritional approaches and supplementation based approaches for maintaining and improving Vision so whether or not you suffer from floaters or dry eye or you're considering changing your eye prescription or you have concerns about whether or not relying on corrective lenses is impairing your vision and you want to enhance your vision or if you're somebody who has perfect vision today's episode is going to include science and protocols that will be highly relevant to you I should also add that if you are somebody who suffers from or who has family members who suffer from diseases of the eye that can impact Vision such as glaucoma retinitis Pigmentosa and macular degeneration we also delve deep into the discussion about the most Advanced Technologies for preventing and offsetting vision loss due to those diseases as well thanks to Dr Goldberg's incredible knowledge his Clarity of communication and his generosity with that knowledge by the end of of today's episode You Will Be armed with all of the modern information you need in order to best maintain and improve your eye and vision health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available I've talked before on this podcast about the key importance of striving to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight now when one strives to do that it's also important to maximize the quality protein to calorie ratio in other words you don't want to consume a lot of extra calories in order to get your quality protein Maui venison in having an extremely high quality protein and nutrient to calorie ratio allows you to do that very easily and in addition to that Maui Nei venison is delicious I particularly like their bone broth which has an unmatched 25 gram of protein per 100 calories I also love their ground venison and their venison steaks all of them are absolutely delicious if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison go to mauii Venison docomond and get 20% off your first order again that's Maui venison docomond to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that is the electrolytes sodium magnes magnesium and potassium but nothing you don't which means no sugar it's critical that we get electrolytes because every cell of our body but in particular our nerve cells our neurons rely on electrolytes in order to function properly with element it's very easy to ingest the correct ratios of electrolytes they come in these little packets they're really delicious you mix them up with anywhere from 8 to 16 to 32 ounces of fluid I like mine pretty concentrated so I'll drink a 16 o glass of water with element in it when I first wake up I'll also consume another one of those maybe 32 ounces with one packet when I exercise and maybe another one if I happen to sweat a lot during exercise or if I was in the sauna and sweating lot if it's a very hot day Etc if you'd like to try element go to drink element that's LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lm.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now there's absolutely no question that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're sleeping well and we're sleeping long enough everything in our daily life goes that much better now a key component to getting a great night's sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your core body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 deg conversely in order to wake up feeling refreshed your core body temperature has to increase by about 1 to 3° with eight Sleep mattress covers you can cool or heat your mattress at the beginning middle and end of your night in order to optimize your night sleep I started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover about 2 years ago and it has dramatically improved the sleep that I get each and every night if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to eights sleep.com huberman and save up to $150 off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eights sleep.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Jeffrey Goldberg Dr Jeffrey Goldberg welcome thanks it's great to be here you and I go way back we will spare people the discussion about all of that but I'm really excited for today's discussion because I get a tremendous number of questions about vision and I health and of course as a neuroscientist who has worked on the visual system I sometimes have answers or partial answers but more often than not I don't have the answers and yet I'm confident that you do or that if you don't you can direct us to the place to get those answers so to kick things off I want to ask you what was one of the most commonly asked questions when I solicited for questions in anticipation of this episode which is how early should one do an eye exam on their child and how regularly should we all be doing eye exams also is the fact that I think I can see normally confirmation that I can see as well as I think I can so that's really three questions but baby comes out do they check their eyes right away and if so how and how often should they check and what kind of information is there yeah it's as it's a great question it's obviously something that touches us all so the qu the answer to that really differs a little bit uh at the different stages of Life first of all every every baby gets an eye exam or should be getting an eye exam and uh one of the main things that you really just are screening for right when that baby is born right in the nursery right in those first few days is to just look for a red reflex you know when you take a camera picture a Flash picture and sometimes you get red eye that's actually the light from the flash as you know reflecting against the retina and coming back out of your eye it looks red and um and a red reflex is actually very normal that's that that's great and if you have a one of a number of diseases in the eye that can present even in babies even in newborn babies including most concerning but thankfully least Comm retinoblastoma which is the most common pediatric eye cancer uh which again thankfully is quite rare uh those babies won't have a red reflex in that eye it'll be kind of a whitish or gray reflex and so even just that first little you know doctors taking the little pen light and even just flashing it in the in the baby's eyes so that's that's that's our first eye exam and and hopefully we've all had that and hopefully every baby being born today is getting that getting that first eye exam is really just looking for for that red reflex uh it's not typical as long as that's looking good um to worry about getting an i exam from there kind of through um childhood like uh maybe early Elementary School unless they B your baby is presenting with one of a number of features that parents often pick up on for example as the baby's aging through those first couple of years you know through the first couple of years babies actually don't have great visual Acuity and so as they're aging over those first couple years it's normal for them to have you know roving eye movements for example be searching their environment um but over those first couple of years if parents start noticing the baby isn't you know isn't uh making eye contact or looking where a sound is certainly if they have what's called nagus like these rapid flickering alternating eye movements uh anything like that of course you're going to trigger trigger an eye exam but otherwise most babies other than their pediatrician doing that red reflex check when they're in for their regular well child checks uh that's really all that's uh needed through that when most kids get to elementary school age there will often be often done at the schools an amblyopia screening exam if kids eyes either if one eye doesn't see that well like maybe you're very nearsighted or farsighted in one eye and pretty normal sided in the other or the two refractive errors are quite different from each other other um that can lead to a condition you've talked about on the podcast before called amblyopia uh which is probably one of the more common or most common eye diseases of children or uh if the eyes aren't aign you know our eye muscles and the Brain behind them are really responsible for keeping the two eyes looking straight ahead and if that's not working properly and one eye is is off-kilter and therefore the image of what we're looking at is falling on different spots of the retina it's not sinking upright in the brain that can lead to this disease condition called amop where that eye is no longer talking to the brain properly and there's a pretty easy screening exam that can be done for strabismus the misalignment of the eyes that kids will do in elementary school the other main presenting symptom if kids in elementary school is when they admit to their parents I can't see the board or I can't see the teacher up front and then they might be quite nearsighted and so that will also trigger an exam and uh so those are usually the parts for for babies for toddlers for children schoolage children that might reasonably trigger an exam a couple of questions about early eye exams and we'll um get on to uh ey exams in older individuals in a second um but I want to interrupt you with this question so you mentioned that um you know there can be a misalignment of the eyes I've seen many people's babies where there is one eyeball that seems to be kind of drifting around and then it might correct but sometimes they'll have a we don't want to get technical here but for our listeners we'll keep it General but they're conver convergent eyes or one eye converging cross eyes or walyed you know again using uh that non-technical language here um and my understanding is that the brain is taking that information in and is very plastic it's changing at these early stages of development and that it's fairly critical to get that stuff corrected early on because if you wait too long the brain can essentially become blind to the the um or rather the the brain cannot learn to handle the proper alignment so in other words if a kid has cross eyes um crossed eyes excuse me and they're not corrected uh until their 20s it's possible that they will never recover normal vision whereas if you recover if you align the eyes properly early in development they can indeed recover Vision how early can and should one consider getting those eye realignments done yeah yeah pretty much right on what they'll do is if they detect any eye misalignment and sometimes parents are are good at noticing that sometimes you take a picture and one eye got the red eye reflex and the other one didn't and sometimes people notice that their kids eyes are sort of turning in it seems like too much um sometimes there's what's called pseudo stabismus which is where actually depending on your Anatomy if you have a little extra skin sort of on the inside corners of your eyes it makes your eyes look turned in when actually they're straight um but if your eyes are actually turned in or slightly less common in children more common in adults this alignment turned out um it's really important to correct that early and the reason is as you were saying the brain starts ignoring it it fails to fully develop the strong connections from the for the data coming in from one of those two eyes into the brain and if you pass certain sort of thresholds during development during childhood without correcting that connectivity getting those two eyes to work together properly um you can permanently lose that um and so we use sort of we used to use very sort of uh you know gross numbers like it's fully correctable if you can intervene before age three it's partly correctable if you can intervene before age six you got a chance before age nine but it turns out in followon studies that even kids into their young teens have a shot at correcting that eye brain connection that amblyopia that that loss of vision uh that that can occur during early development so even if you're only you know unfortunately detecting that later on in childhood or even sort of the tween years or early teen years it's still worth a try to really push to um retrain the weaker eye and then also realign the muscles so that they can work together to keep the eyes focused I'll tell you it's interesting and there's a lot more to learn about BL brain plasticity and probably a lot of really cool new therapies yet to discover that could reopen what's called critical period plasticity this this this plasticity that we have during development that kind of goes away as we age and and that critical period plasticity as you know has been the best studied actually in the visual system and the idea that we could reopen that is really fantastic but for different parts of that ibrain connection there's different periods for critical period plasticity for example even if you get the amblyopic eye to see well again and then you realign the eyes and now they're working together a lot of kids will never recover full depth perception stereopsis the use of two eyes to see depth for example so why that part of the brain doesn't correct as well as the visual Acuity or central vision part of the brain I'm not sure if we understand that yet I'm gonna ask for a curbside consult as uh it's sometimes called right now by telling you a story when I was a kid I went swimming without goggles and I had one eye closed and the other eye open and closing as it went in and out of the water because I'm a deficient swimmer and I only breathe to one side unless I really consciously forced myself to breathe to both sides in a freestyle swim got out of the pool and I was seeing double it was pretty eerie and then it became downright scary because I didn't recover my double vision until they patched one of the eyes forcing me to used the other eye that had been closed the entire time and fortunately this was done early enough and it I was young enough that within I think it was about a day or so I restored what normal vision however my depth perception is terrible um I'm the kid that you know Fly ball was hits me in the Outfield and it's coming it's coming then it would hit me this is why I've generally focused on foot Sports throughout my entire life as opposed to you know precise um hand eye coordination I'm better at throwing darts things with one eye closed than I ever would be with both eyes maybe that's true for most people question I have is is it true that even just a few hours of misalignment of information to the two eyes early in development can permanently rewire the brain unless there are some corrective measures such as patching up one eye um and the example I gave is just one but for instance if um uh you know someone injures you know gets a scratch on their cornea and they close they patch eye and the person happens to be 10 years old is it important to then patch the other healthy eye after the the um you know the the scratched eye is feeling better in other words how critical is it to ensure the balance of information coming into the two eyes even on the order of hours or days yeah your story is uh has some features of uh you know totally usual how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia where one eye is weaker patching the strong eyes to the weak eye can recover but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception and so that part of it is you know quite stereotypical the part of your story that's atypical is that for most kids um an hour or two let alone minutes an hour or two even an hour or two a day if you were I don't know if you were a young kid and you just really were training up on throwing darts and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts you know really practicing for an hour or day it'd be very unusual for that to trigger this kind of either stabismus misalignment of the eyes let alone amblyopia uh and the stabismus is what's giving you the double vision because they're misaligned let alone the am amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker if I had to guess of course not having you know done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool if I had to guess I would guess that you may have had some intermittent strabismus and your brain was already getting kind of hit and and you neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it it could be happening you know at other times a day or you're not kind of really paying attention it doesn't kind of stand out in the way that that that day that that you got out of the swimming pool you really noticed it and it may not have been that strong it may have been quite intermittent but if you had had some years of intermittent esotropia or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out of the eyes that just happened here and there but was accumulating sort of uh damage or failure to connect over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool and that day just tipped you over the edge and you've got double vision you really noticed it that led to an eye exam at an eye care provider and they said wait a second this eye is stronger this ey is weaker you've got a little ellopia we're going to start patching your strong eye so you can get your weak eye back so for 99.99% of the kids who like you know yeah they get a little corneal scratch or they're patching one eye closed or or uh you know and anything that's sort of a rare event like that nothing to worry about parents don't have to worry kids can be kids they can play they can do that kind of thing and uh and not have to worry and and it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance which kids been having the intermittent amop because we don't do a standard eye exam on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything but but yeah so that's that's an unusual case in yours and if I had to guess I I would bet that you were having some sort of subclinical untracked Uncharted unnoticed maybe strabismus leading up to that point okay great thank you you can send me a bill at the end um along those lines I'm 47 years old so I was um part of the generation that grew up with some computers in the classroom but not a lot uh nowadays kids from a very young age are looking at iPads and phones and screens and things very close up and there is a wealth of experimental animal data showing that if you limit Vision to just close range that the eyeball lengthens and therefore the visual image Falls in front of and not directly onto the neural retina the essentially the light sensing portion of the of the eye and those animals become myopic or nearsighted what can we say about the environmental conditions in which kids are seen from the time they're born through let's say adolescence and their teen years in terms of how their visual system wires up and are there any recommendations that are coming from the scientific literature clinical studies clinical trial excuse me or otherwise that indicate what a healthy visual environment consists of yeah yeah that's a great question and actually it's really relevant these days because uh you know myopia is so common uh it's more common um in Asian populations you know it's called an epidemic in China uh in California we have a lot of Asian Heritage or asian-americans and so we see a lot like at Stanford we see a lot of um you know myopia in kids and adults and really starting to get thoughtful on the science of myopia control how do we how do we we provide the right environments now what's interesting is that for decades the Assumption some of the data really led us to the path of thinking like gosh the more you spend at near activities and these are Mouse model experiments like you describe but also well-designed human cohort studies you know figuring out like asking you know kids and families like how long is your kid reading or in front of the computer how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did Point towards this concept that if you do too much near work as a kid that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness as you get through those those sort of you know uh pre-teen and even into the teen years which is when most of that myopia progression or eyeball elongation is actually happening to cause nearsightedness it's only been in the last few years that some really exciting Studies have actually pointed in a slightly different direction and that's that maybe it's not all not to say it's not about near activity but maybe it's not all about near activity maybe it's actually a little more about the kind of light we're getting into our eyes and I think you've talked about this before and it's really important when they've now studied and asked the kids instead of just how much near and how much far are you doing how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting which doesn't have full spectrum light in a typical indoor environment versus how much time are you spending Outdoors playing in the yard you could be reading outside but what are you what what kind of time are you spending outside and and and of course when you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progress dressing in their nearsightedness less like their their nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye uh but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you you know if your kids playing on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time but I want you to spend some of the time that you're doing that Outdoors are there any thresholds for the amount of time that uh one would suggest their child be outdoors um to get that full spectrum light that's a great question you know we talk about cohort studies where we just ask people what are they doing and there seems to be you know a little bit of what we would call a dose dependent response maybe the more time Outdoors might be better we don't know if there's an upper limit like gosh if you go over 2 or three hours there's no additional benefit talk about that in cohort studies the real gold standard for answering these kinds of questions are randomized control trials and specifically Placebo controlled or or a control group that's not getting the intervention that's our highest level of evidence for clinical evidence for for any of this kind of science uh when we're talking about humans or preclinical models in the laboratory and the study that hasn't been done yet to really answer that question is to randomize kids to telling this group of kids you just do your normal life tell this group of kids we want you outside an hour this group of kids we want you outside two hours a day this group will K three hours a day and see between the groups is there a big difference like we have pretty good evidence now from the studies that have been done that the difference between zero and one or two hours is clearly there is 5 minutes enough is 5 hours better I don't think we know the answers to those questions yet like what's the right dose um but there's probably at least some dose dependence to that and it I can imagine it's a little bit hard to tease apart the near far viewing from the indoor outdoor because yes of course a child could be outside on an iPad up close but it's hard to imagine that at some point they aren't seeing off into the distance far viewing as it's called and reverse is also true if you're indoors unless you live in a very very large home or you're staring off a balcony far viewing is much harder to achieve yeah yeah so it's and perhaps it isn't important to isolate these variables although I can see the challenge in developing a really good clinical trial randomized clinical trial for this meanwhile I I you know I'm con I'll go into the grave shouting you know or saying rather and suggesting that people get some morning sunlight in their eyes to set their circadian rhythm um but far viewing a few at least a few minutes and ideally hours per day or a mixture of near and far viewing by being outdoors just seems like a good thing to do regardless of age so are there any data in older people not necessarily elderly but older people so um people in they from say 25 years of age into their 60s or 70s that getting outdoors and getting this full spectrum light is healthy for the eye in ways that are separate from the known healthy effects of doing that on circadian rhythm setting yeah yeah the cadium Parts pretty clear the in most patient in most in most people the near the development of nearsightedness happens a lot until age 10 little more through age 20 little more than that into the in you know in through the 20s up to 30 tiny bit in the 30s up to 40 but usually by those later ages your prescription might be changing a quarter of a diopter that's the measurement that we use when we you know give you your glass glasses prescription a quarter of a diopter half a diopter it could get a half diopter more nearsighted or less nearsighted you know once you're aging into your 40s 50s and Beyond so most of the action on nearsightedness development is actually really happening in the younger ages so again the the premise of intervening in an older person and I'll just include you and me and older people for the sake of this definition as much as I'm reticent to do that in general um I think the the the premise of in of a of of sort of light modulation for nearsightedness in older people is probably probably not so strong I think there are a lot of other benefits you've talked a lot about circadian rhythm there are so many health benefits to exercise and you know if you're getting Outdoors there's a good chance you're going to be walking or bicycling you know so so exercise value for the health of our eyes and the rest of our body is clearly there um but I don't know that there's really a strong premise that you're going to change your glasses prescription you know in our 40s or 50s or or Beyond I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic green you can go to athletic greens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's athletic greens.com hubman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 it's probably worth touching on some of the dos and some of the don'ts for I Health generally uh and then I promise I'm going to get us back to adult eye exams um because have a lot of questions about that I can imagine that it's probably not a great idea to be exposed to extremely bright light and this is why people who weld wear eye Shields um but of course most people are not welding um what other sorts of environmental conditions are detrimental to our vision health across the lifespan um including brightness of light uh we talked a little bit about near far um obviously we want to keep toxins and acids and solvents and things out of the eye but what do you see I'm hopefully not commonly but what are some of the things that you feel might not be discussed enough in terms of Eye Health yeah you know I think at all ages eye safety is something that we don't talk about enough um you know our eyes are delicate the front surface of the eye the cornea the Clear Window that lets the light go into your eye that's a delicate very sensitive structure it's thin maybe a millimeter at the thickest half millimeter in the center of our eye uh the retina is it it's neural tissue this is like really an outgrowth of the brain this is very sensitive it's subject to degenerative disease and injury our eyes even if they just get hit can get very inflamed our eyes can be more inflammatory than a bruise on our skin on our shoulder might be so I safety is a big one and people who are um working in certain industries um you know anyone who's doing any metal grinding people who are even just gardening you know and if you're if you're doing some significant gardening and cutting and you could you know Fleck a little bit of dirt and there's a lot of there's a lot of for example fungus that lives in the ground natural stuff it's all very normal in the in the Earth but you know our eyes aren't really made to absorb that fungus and and have have a piece of dirt kind of stick in our eye like that and so people are at risk I think for you know for not and we see too much kind of really unnecessary eye injury eye trauma that if people wore either their glasses because they happen to wear prescription glasses or goggles or for more advanced work you know safety goggles of course um if you're sanding doing wood shop projects anything like that sawing including you know again in the garden cutting things um you know I think I think eye safety you know eye trauma is a big one and you know we probably see one or two um what we call open Globes a week come into the Opera uh into the emergency room and um you know those are tough because you know again the eyes delicate and it can do a lot of healing but but not infinite right and so we really you know that's that's one that I think is really an untapped opportunity is just a little more education around um around eye protection protecting against eye trauma what about eye cleanliness there's some pretty dramatic videos also um I've put some of these on my Instagram handle these are MRIs of people rubbing their eyeballs and people really getting a sense of first of all a restatement of what you said getting a real sense of just how much the eyes are in outgrowth of the brain because of the op when you see them with the optic nerves and all their beauty and the eyeballs moving around as someone rubs their eyes I have to imagine that rubbing the eyeballs a little bit as IM but I actually called you I don't know if you remember when I was a a junior Professor I woke up from an app one day and I couldn't see had of one eye I was freaking out so of course I called you and I had pressure blinded Myself by falling asleep on my hand or something like that and you assured me that my vision would come back and indeed it did so you played dual role of opthalmologist and psychiatrist thank you and indeed I can see out of both eyes um now um but rubbing our eyes getting gunk our eyes you know I think unless somebody has lost their Vision temporarily it's hard to imagine this is like a big deal but when it happens it is truly frightening we're so dependent on Vision so um you know what are your recommendations about rubbing or not rubbing eyeballs about um hand washing and cleanliness and also how do you wash an eye properly do you use soap and flush it with water or do you just flush it with water or she not even do that she use saline and realize these might sound like low-level questions but these are the things that people deal with on on an all too frequent basis yeah you know for most people most of the time actually the eyes are a very good clean environment and actually our tears are are contain enzymes that help break down bacteria and bacterial toxins and so for most people regular eyew washing doesn't have to be any part of their standard routine in terms of the surface of the eye the part of your eye the conjunctiva uh over the whites of the eyes underneath the eyelids anything underneath the ey it's pretty self-cleaning and actually our tear production and blinking is very good at keeping our eyes clean uh the eyelids eyelashes can be another story and especially as we age uh we can you know like our skin is breaking down a little differently than when we were younger you can develop what we sort of nickname scurf which is like kind of little dead skin bits that accumulate around the eyelashes a lot of people develop what we call blefaritis which is just just means inflammation of the eyelashes yeah and for that doing some eye scrubs is a good idea they actually sell uh little pads that you can buy kind of a little that you rip open and you can use to kind of lightly clean the eyelashes uh but you can also just use like a No More Tears baby shampoo just pump a little bit into the palm of your hand once or twice a day uh let a little uh dilute it with a little water under the sink and either with your finger or an edge of a washcloth just very light rub the eyelashes what I like to do with the eyes closed with the eyes closed and and don't scrunch them closed too tight because you're actually burying the eyelashes when you do the the roots of the eyelashes when you really scrunch close so just gently close your eyes just you know real gentle closure and then just lightly scrub it shouldn't be abrasive you're not trying to exfoliate the eyelids or eyelashes in any way just lightly rub with that kind of dilute No More Tears baby shampoo and that can really help people with eye Comfort if you feel like you got something in your eye your ideal eyewash is actually going to be a sterile saline solution a saltwater solution that you know they sell little bottles over the- counter uh eyewash Solutions like that a lot of people wear contacts will have that kind of eyewash solution just a sterile saline eyewash just pure salt water doesn't have to have any other chemicals or preservatives in it you can of course use not actual uh sea water salt water not salt water thank you yeah not salt water out of your salt pool not salt water out of the ocean but like a saline salt waterer that's available in a sterile now you can also just use artificial teardrops and some of those come in nonpreserved some of those come in preserved versions those are all also completely safe in the to use in the eye and there you can you know you can sort of Spritz into your eye you know hold the lid open and give it a little Spritz if you feel like you got something in your eye piece of dirt or A Lash that's not coming out just to rinse it but but having like a regular routine you know you're not going to hurt anything with the occasional eye rubbing we all do these things just kind of as a you know even a nervous habit or just absentmindedly you know you might you know scratch your arm or rub your eyes or things like that that's fine you're not going to hurt anything uh there are conditions where people sort of develop kind of a almost like a psychological habit there are certain conditions where people actually do too much eye rubbing it can be Danger ous if you're in that group but for the regular run-of-the-mill every day occasional eye rubbing fine if you certainly if you get a lash in there and you're trying to rub it and blink it and tear it out uh and again in that situation you can use some artificial tears wedding drops saline drops uh those would be the way to do it what an incredible tissue the way you describe it you know the self-cleaning and yet so delicate a piece of the brain literally lining the back of each of our eyes like like a pie crust I mean it's a really remarkable um biological system of course I don't have to tell you that it's just it it never ceases to to amaze me let's talk about eye exams in adults so people are aware presumably that they're optometrists and opthalmologists I think it's important that we Define their different and also overlapping roles and for those that you know are past High School age probably not getting eye exams unless they're sensing a problem um perhaps not even with blurry vision or or difficulty seeing at a distance but sometimes just what feels like fatigue of the eyes or a hard time maintaining alignment of the eyes um so how often do you recommend people get eye exams what is a true regular eye exam and is it important that people go to an opthalmologist or will an optometrist suffice typically optometrists are a little bit easier for most people to access because there's usually one someplace near an eyeglass store um so what are their roles how often should we get our eyes checked yeah um optometrist and opthalmologists do have very overlapping roles in being ey care providers uh there are something over 40 or 50,000 optometrists in the United States there's somewhere around 20,000 opthamologists in the United States optometrists get an optometry degree they often have OD after their name opthalmologists usually went you know went to medical school they either have an MD after their name or they kind of a do version of a medical degree and uh and then optometrists will have done additional clinical training in that area in their area uh of ey care provision opthalmologist MD doctor opthalmologist uh Eye Care providers in addition to that training will have done surgical training in Opthalmology um now uh there's a lot of overlap and um in both scenarios uh you can be getting your sort of General exam taken care of maybe a screening exam I think that there's been a traditional differentiation between optometrist and opthalmologists with optometrist providing a little more of the primary care eye screening maybe managing early disease common diseases as well uh with more advanced disease often sort of upgrading to perhaps specialist opthalmologists in those areas but that distinction has been uh declining over time it's still true that in I think most if not all states only the MD opthalmologists uh surgeons can do eye surgeries but um both both groups of eye care providers can diagnose both can prescribe uh appropriate eye drop treatments including prescription ey drop treatments for for many of our diseases uh eye diseases and um and in some states optometrists have successfully lobbied for uh sort of expanded rights of providing Air Care Eye Care and again um access to care for you know the regular person wherever they may live is is the most important element and so being able to access ey care whether it's with an optometrist in your community or an opthalmologist that may be in your community or maybe at a distance I think that's that's the the really important thing is to access care now kind of like we were talking about with kids uh if you're in your teens 20s maybe even 30s and not having any problem you've got no complaints you can see it distance you can see it near um you know so you can read without glasses you can drive without glasses um you're not having any eye pains you know pains around the eyes you know redness of the eyes you may never present to an eye care provider uh through the first four Decades of life and almost all the time it's going to be okay right if you're not symptomatic the chance you've got some terrible lurking disease in there is low but we do wish that we had a little more screening going on because there are some diseases gloma for example my specialty the two main risk factors for glaucoma are increasing ing age and it usually presents you know in most cases actually after age 40 but also increasing eye pressure and if your eye pressure is too high you can't feel that that won't feel funny to you if it sort of slowly is crept up over the years and so from a screening perspective it is good to get some kind of screening exam could be at a public health fair could be that you go into the local optometrist just say hey I've never been checked I'd like to be checked once make sure everything's good could you ask for sorry to interrupt but could somebody say I'd like my pressures checked as I recall at the optometrist they're going to do a puff test so they're going to blast some air um get a sense of how how rigid or or um soft again using a non-clinical non-technical language here the eyeball happens to be um now right now by the way I'm sure there are um several hundreds of thousands of people who are with eyes closed touching the sides of their eyeballs and I'm only half joking please don't do this folks um given the conversation we just had about eye cleanliness and eye rubbing but my understanding is is that the old F truly old-fashioned eye pressure exam was you would close your eyes and the opthalmologist would gently press to see whether or not your eyes were more rigid than last time yeah is that right yeah that's called botman and you can kind of you can you can kind of just take one second if you're listening and press on your eyes just very lightly and you there's a little give of course the eyelids part of that give but but it's not it's not like rock hard and if we press and it feels under the eyelid like gosh something under there is Rock card then we know something is wrong that is way too high pressure if it's rock hard but I'll tell you our ability to differentiate the fine points of eye pressure other than Rock Hard or not rock hard is pretty limited so yeah the optometrist office or the opthalmologist office as part of a comprehensive screening exam they'll check the eye pressure they'll look at the surface of your eyes make sure everything's looking healthy there including the eyelids and lashes and the look inside the eye and be able to scre green for these diseases that way too in addition to checking if you're complaining of any you know blurriness at distance or at near now after age 40 or so a lot of people will present to an eye care provider because we all get what's called presbyopia and presbyopia just translates to disease vision of the Aged so you know myopia is our word for nearsighted hyperopia is farsighted actually emat means normal sided so I can see at distance without any glasses I'm emat Tropic but then we all get presbyopia and as we age the lens inside our eye that's helping focus light onto our retina gets stiffer such that our eye muscles are no longer able to relax and reshape that lens and we're not as good as we age at moving our Focus from distance Vision distance Vision by the way is basically anything 3T or further away You're basically viewing light rays coming from Infinity at once you're past three feet so three feet or further being able to focus that into 14 in or 12 Ines which might be a normal comfortable reading space for you we lose that ability to flex our lens relax our lens uh refocus our lens from distance to near and most people around age 40 could be a couple years years before could be five or 10 years later that you notice it but sort of around that time you start needing reading glasses you need a little extra even if you can see fine at distance and don't need prescription glasses for distance you need a booster you need reading glasses for near I don't know if you're experiencing this yet yeah I'm really intrigued by this but maybe you could clarify when you say reading glasses do you mean just a magnifier because I use a you know a 0.5 or a 75 magnifier for reading but I try and rely on them as little as possible and I want to get to this about using glasses as a crutch and the problems with that um I have a story about that too I seem you know it's no coincidence I decide to work on Vision I mean after all um had a bunch of vision issues that fortunately are corrected but you know I I do experience for instance when I wake up in the morning if I look at my phone which by the way folks I try and get outside and see sunlight first before ever looking at the phone but I'll notice when I first look at my phone in the morning that I can see it very clearly through my right eye but that if I cover my right eye my left eye is extremely blurry to the point where I'm like I'm calling Jeff you know I'm I'm afraid but then over the course of maybe 10 15 minutes it resolves and I don't think it's because something's in my eye I don't think it's pressure of having slept on that side I don't think it's a lubrication of the eye issue um but the two eyes seem to come into Focus so to speak um at different rates early in the day and if I pop my readers on I can see right away so I will use readers late in the day often um if I want to read at night or something that sort it just it feels so much more relaxing I feel like like I can finally relax whereas otherwise I realize that I'm straining in order to see does is there any um clinical clinical data in what I just described yeah I you know Andy I'll tell you my story that's like that and um we were living down in San Diego when you and I were both professors at UC San Diego and uh we had moved into a house and I found a pair of glasses a pair of reading glasses uh in a closet and you know we asked around you know did any of the grandparents uh leave some glasses behind nobody seemed to know who they were so we we finally just decided like well I guess the people who moved out of the house just left a pair of glasses you know in this in the back of this closet and then I tried the glasses on and I looked at my phone up close and was just like oh my God wait a second I didn't realize how blurry my near Vision was and this is back I was about 40 42 something like that so so I didn't even realize until I put on the readers and these were you know 1.25 magnifiers you know so also mild mild ones and I'll tell you I got addicted because who doesn't like good Vision right right right I mean oh my God now I can make the type smaller on my phone I can you know was wonderful and you can relax a bit I mean the musculature that's responsible for for moving the lens and focusing the eye and then all this extraocular musculature I we forget I mean I'm definitely going crows feet um around my eyes uh probably because I you know squint or something but you know just the ability to relax one's face it's just feels like you know more more energy I feel like can be devoted to what we're actually looking at not making light of this yeah well pretty soon I just kept that one pair of glasses with me all the time and I would just keep them in a pocket and whip them out whenever I was you know working at near using my phone at a little greater distance like a typical computer distance I could still see the computer fine so it really started for like kind of that close-up phone it was it was I could get into here but not all the way into here and um yeah and then pretty soon I was just totally addicted and so you know then I had to go buy 10 pairs and leave them one by the bedside table you know one in the car one in the computer bag one on every desk I work at yeah because I'd leave them anywhere and forget them and that way just yeah exactly you know yeah so um yeah so whether using the readers accelerates the progression of dependence on the readers is still uh not you know that's still up for debate you know some studies say maybe yes some studies say maybe no but certainly psychologically we get addicted to good easy vision and if you don't have to squint and if you're not straining your muscles and all of a sudden the the text on your phone looks crisper again uh boy that's addictive you're you're going to like good vision and so it feels like you're getting dependent and how much of that is change in the eye muscles and how much of that is just the pschology of wanting to have good Vision I think probably the jury's a little bit out on that point but point being your either either way your dependence will grow and as you continue to age 40s 50s up until about 60 65 the ability to shape that lens gets weaker and weaker and weaker and so you need to move from the 05s to the 1.0s to the 1.5s and the coke bottle to the coke botle thankfully you eventually max out at about plus 2.5 or plus three because that's the amount of extra refractive power that you need in magnifiers to take the equivalent of your Infinity viewing and bring it up to 14 in to read it near basically you need a plus three and then you don't need any lens ey muscle action whatsoever so you kind of max out around 2.5S or three so because most people will hit this somewhere in their 40s this sort of like gosh I'm having trouble on the phone I think most people actually use that that's like kind of the first time for a lot of people they're like well I guess I should go to the eye office right see the optometrist or maybe opthalmologist and when they go in they should be getting the standard in either of those offices will be to give you a full screening exam including maybe it's the puff test or a blue light test or a little pen that that can check your eye pressure and having a look inside and seeing if you're retin and optic nerve look healthy it's kind of screening for all the main diseases and so and they'll tell you at that point hey you look great if you feel like your glasses aren't doing it for you in a year or three years come back or they might say hey I've detected something I'm worried about you and they'll set up a routine for your ongoing Eye Care assuming that somebody doesn't have um you know some form of amopa or the need for some really robust corrective lenses and they are already using readers let's say a plus one or so you know plus one plus or minus point5 reader would you recommend based on my experience and based on your experience that people strive to avoid using them for as long as they can because in some sense if that's the recommendation then the recommendation is that people kind of deal with the fact that they're seeing a little less well or a lot less well than they possibly could so I'm assuming that people can still drive well people can still read but it involves a little bit more effort in other words are we weakening Our Eyes by using these these readers I I realize you said that the data are a little bit mixed but as long as one can perform their required daily activities would we be better off delaying the use of readers there's two important answers to that question one is regarding the lens and the eye muscles that control the lens and it's entirely plausible that's what I was saying kind of the data is mixed on but it's plausible that if we would just exercise like work a little harder kind of not use as strong a reader as we want or not use that reader as often as we might really enjoy uh are we exercising those muscles and kind of exercising the ability to to to stretch versus relax the lens and kind of slow the progression from the 1.0 reader to the 1.25 reader to the 1.5 reader Etc right and so that that's why I saying the data is mixed but there's a good premise that maybe if you're exercising but let me give you the on on the other hand it's probably ideal to give your retina and your brain the sharpest visual signals you can so why hamstring your retina and your brain and your vision and your enjoyment and ability to read or do near work by constantly undercutting the the the reading glasses or leaving them out or you're not helping the whole back part of your maybe you're maybe you're helping the lens but you're definitely not helping your retina and brain by feeding it blurry information all of that time so I actually think just give in use the readers have your enjoy your Best Vision all the time and if that means wearing glasses and by the way if that means that you're going to have minus two glasses for vision and you'll eventually need minus 250s for distance Vision or if you're going to need readers 1.5 readers now and in a few years 2.0 readers okay so you'll get the next reader it's it's actually not a big deal you can you can you know you're not you're not hurting you're probably helping and in the meantime it's an enormous enjoyment to actually have good Vision all the time right so so I actually counsel people just wear the glasses that work best for you you know you're only minimally changing how your prescription is going to change over time very minimally so just enjoy your Best Vision even if it's using readers for close or or prescription glasses for far appreciate that recommendation I do enjoy you using the readers at night it really helps for all the reasons I mentioned before I've noticed that driving at night presents an enormous strain on my visual system and I've noticed this for a number of years are there any um I know there's something called stationary night blindness I don't think I'm stationary night blind um I think the mutation for stationary night blindness was identified in the Kusa horse or something like that these were horses that you could walk up to very easily and they wouldn't even you until you're right there someone's going to correct me on this it's the internet but I think that the mutation was identified um Etc but I don't think I'm stationary night blind but I do find that driving at night I get very fatigued and then I'll sometimes even wear my plus one readers when I drive at night which removes the fatigue even though I'm looking more or less at a distance are there some conditions that make it hard for people to see at night for which they would want corrective lenses um and what what sorts of biology underlies that assuming that somebody is not stationary night blind or a Kusa I think is the name of the breed horse yeah that's a great question you know we for the for the optical defects in our eyes most or many of which can be corrected with just having the right prescription lenses we can get away with it without using those Corrections in brighter light and so during the daytime um you know uh you could be slightly blurry you know if I have a real bright light uh and a good high contrast book you know with black letters on the white page I can get away with reading that without my readers unlike if if I'm in dim light then I feel and that might be kind of what you're describing if you're reading at night you actually prefer to use the readers a little more even at night because we can make up for a lot of that blur if we just have bright enough signal and contrast coming into our eyes makes sense yeah so when you're driving at night and noticing this this might be revealing a little bit of a need for glasses now I'm not suggesting this is the answer but far more common than having congenital stationary night blindness would be being what's called a latent hyperope okay now we talked about already how the lens inside our eye goes from focusing at distance to then we squeeze the muscles the lens actually rounds up and allows us to focus it near some people's Optical system of their eye is actually wired uh or designed or sort of set up in length not for regular distance which would be anywhere from about 3 feet to Infinity but it's actually designed it's actually tuned for being beyond Infinity which doesn't make any actual sense when you talk about it but just the Optics of the eye at their best Focus are actually focusing the light behind the retina and and if you're doing that when you're younger you're actually using some of your focusing power to to to use those muscles strain those muscles relax that lens round up that lens and have your vision Focus From Beyond Infinity to normal distance like distance vision and so if you're a late and hyperope you are constantly using those muscles and again if you're tired it's the end of the day your muscles are feeling a little fatigued uh your latent hyperopia or by the way if you've had a drinker too uh alcohol can do this too your latent hyperopia can kind of kick in especially as we're aged and we're not as good at refocusing that lens anyway and now all of a sudden your vision is kind of reverting to its natural state which is slightly out of focus at distance because it's actually focused Beyond infin if you will and so all of a sudden you put on that plus one just for a little extra booster kick and you're like oh yeah yeah distance vision is clean and easy now so I'll have to bring you into the clinic to really be sure but you could be exhibiting a little bit of that kind of lat and hyperopia I definitely want the ey exam and I want it from you and I've been called a lot of things in life um and we can now let add perhaps latent hyper op uh to that I I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be assessed with a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information about what to do with all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc and then to assess what sorts of Behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you if you'd like to try insid

designed to be an eye exam for me but um I have yet another experience that I think illustrates the key importance of both critical period plasticity and the questions about whether or not to rely on corrective lenses and that is uh from the time I was pretty young I could make my sister laugh by deviating one eye inward so not crossing my eyes but moving one eye Inward and then what happened was when I was in college and studying a lot a lot and getting very fatigued I noticed that this I started just kind of drift in a little bit so I went to the campus Health Center and they gave me a prescription for a prism lens which of course redirects the image but then I noticed that this eyeball moving Inward and I guess for those of you watching on uh on YouTube and not just listening um I can do this um by just moving one eye in all right as I can move this eye in yeah it's fairly pronounced it started to really drift in at at a relaxation State and I started seeing double again so I thought these prism this one prism lens lens is a crutch of the sort that I really don't want crushed the glasses broke them and and never went back to them um I have voluntary control over it but that's one example where the corrective lens can actually create a pretty significant shift in eye position if one relies on it so this gets back to this issue of um when should people Force themselves to work with their natural vision maybe do some more far viewing um as a and certainly get outside and get sunlight into the sunlight full spectrum light as opposed to relying on corrective lenses yeah and and you've raised a very important distinction here and that's the distinction between the muscles that are inside our eye that we use to relax and refocus the lens and the muscles that are on the outside of the eyeball of course inside our orbit but on the outside of the eyeball that turn the eyes and if everything's working right keeps our eyes really yolked straight and we talk talked about earlier uh this possibility that you may have been having a little bit of intermittent esotropia or intermittent turning in of the eyes that then culminated on that day day at the pool when you really noticed it um and your ongoing ability to actually turn one eye in could be related to that I I remember as a kid standing in front of the mirror and I I couldn't get my eyes to cross even though friends could do it and you know so you know I I I I was in the losing group on that on that end of the SP became an opthalmologist and then I became an opthalmologist which and I must say it is very reassuring that you have excellent Vision you know I always worry when I go to a new dentist and then I look up at them in one moment and if they're not wearing a mask that their teeth are not you know pristine I think well what am I doing here so you know an opthalmologist with excellent Vision G brings me uh great comfort the cobbler's children should have shoes right exactly um but yeah so so when to correct when not to correct with lenses and I realize here we haven't talked at all about contacts we've been talking about eyeglasses yeah let's come to context in a sec if you want but yeah let let let me return to your question the difference between providing corrective lenses that allow you to focus for near or distance uh in your glasses so that you can go easy on the inside the eye eye muscle having to work so hard a lot of people get eye strain and sort of uh headaches even from that from not having an adequate correction that they're wearing that's different actually ESP especially when we're children or again into that maybe even into the teens and even young adult years from the eye muscles on the outside of the eyes which are supposed to be yoking our eyes straight and so that you have them both looking at the same point in space and and there it's actually quite a common treatment to try to undercorrect and ask people to exercise and not just give a prism that says hey if your eyes in sometime we'll use a prism so the light sort of looks right to you but rather undercorrect that and sort of really force you to exercise trying to yoke your two eyes straight together and so that's that's in contrast and there actually I I think many optometrists who often specialize in in what are the right glasses to give in a situation like that uh wherever possible especially during uh development as our bodies are developing as we're sort of growing in our younger years uh take the approach of intentionally trying to undercorrect not use a prism or not use a full prism correction uh and um to to really help uh sometimes it's also like an accommodative reflex that your eyes are just you're spending so much time reading it near when you read it near your eyes actually naturally turn in a little bit to focus uh at that near so that they can be looking at the same word on the page uh and that can also if you've got kind of too much muscle drive you can overshoot that and so sometimes just using not a prism but like a little bit of a plus lens in kids just so they don't have to work quite so hard to turn their eyes in and sort of EX ovx exercise those muscles these are all great examples where going to an iare provider often for these kinds of issues an optometrist is the right first place to start you'd like to say that every optometrist and every opthalmologist is always going to give the exact right thing for for each kid or young adult or older adult to do and and we wish all medical care providers were were always right on Target and a lot of times it's a perfect science but a lot of times it's an imperfect science and so it could be that at least with you know we're now 20 25 30 years later but like it could be that today that 20 year-old version of yourself would have been given a different uh approach to having one eye intermittently occasionally turning in like that is there any real value to um near exercises you know so-called pencil push-ups or uh smooth Pursuit tracking I've talked a little bit about it before on the podcast but that was you know some time ago so what are your thoughts on on that is there any value whatsoever I mean they they require a little bit of work just like going to the gym but you know you know 25 reps a day of near far um especially as one is transitioning from age 30 to age 50 um is it worthwhile yeah is it harmful in any way definitely not harmful and again uh you know would it slow down or sort of um slow down your progression to Presby opio or needing those reading glasses uh could be some people also develop um sort of uh you know a real failure to properly turn their eyes in and so they actually would benefit if you've been diagnosed with that inability you're having double vision at near but not at distance um so that kind of convergence insufficiency for example uh that then pencil push-ups often get prescribed as a way to try to exercise those skills in you know uh in your eye muscles um I should interrupt here and just tell people for those of you that are listening not watching the pencil push-up we can put a a link to it uh in the show note captions but it's essentially taking a pen or pencil looking at it at um at Arms distance and then uh slowly moving it toward your nose and U deliberately working hard and it is a bit of effort to continue to focus on it at a close distance at some point it will become blurry because I can't cross my eyes any further um unless I become a cyclops and then moving it back out again and doing that for you know 10 to 25 repetitions maybe once or twice a day a few times a week um that's what those are pencil push-ups yeah yeah so um you're certainly not going to hurt anything there are other situations where those really do get prescribed and there's definitely some good clinical trial data suggesting that they can actually help for example recovery from concussion a l a lot of people actually one of the really telling ways to diagnose concussion and this can be concussion from sports or a fall or you know any any source of concussion uh your smooth Pursuit which is the ability let's say I've got a DOT moving around in a circle on a screen and I'm following that dot with my eyes my eyes should be able to very smoothly follow that circle around the lit up hockey puck on one watching a hockey game is that like that you're a hockey fan right like that you know just following a ball you know following any movement with smooth Pursuits of your eyes and after concussion that actually those systems in our brain the sort of reflexive ability to properly follow that use that visual input to tell your ey muscles exactly where to move gets disrupted and so all of a sudden your smooth Pursuit starts to look choppy it's not so smooth anymore and it's actually a way to diagnose and follow recovery from concussion and part of the visual rehab sort of neuro rehab one of the approaches being used and further studied still in recovery from concussion is actually doing those kinds of exercises like pencil push-ups or basically what you've described as focusing from far away to focusing near and doing that back and forth and using that to sort of like help regain uh the tighter control of our eye movements and that eye brain connection so if traumatic brain injury causes deficits in smooth Pursuit eye movements and some of the recovery protocols for traumatic brain injury are to have people do smooth Pursuit protocols and pencil push-ups are these also the sorts of things that anyone can just do I mean whenever possible we like to share tools for various aspects of Health on this podcast but of course we don't want people cowboying this stuff in a way that could be detrimental to their to their Vision so is it okay to get on YouTube and find a smooth suit um uh Tool uh we can put a link to these there there are several of them um and people spend a few minutes doing this yeah you're definitely not going to hurt anything so totally fine to do it and some people may notice you know like they feel a little more visually active if they do these kinds of exercises um I think most people would do them and not notice something in their daily life we actually have um made so much progress you know in research in thinking about how do we take the diseased or dysfunctioning or aging eye and get it back to healthy and normal but there's a whole other area of science that's we're really just barely touching we've actually we've actually just opened a vision performance center to really get at not just how do we rehab the sick eye back to to health but what's the difference between functioning normally and functioning above normally for example athletes when they get studied for visual Vision characteristics they have faster visual reflexes higher visual Acuity uh how much of that was you know genetic how much of that is trained we don't really understand could we train all of us with you know normal vision to get up to Supra normal vision these are like great important questions that are really relevant to you know every regular person of course you know people doing Esports in The Gaming Community and athletes this part of what we're studying in the vision performance center but these are really really big opportunities to try to understand how do we move people from normal vision to supernormal vision and there's evidence that you can do it so here here's a great example some athletes train using these special goggles that actually use electrical signals in the glasses part of the goggles to actually black out your vision 130th of every second 2 30ths of every second 3 30ths of Every second now imagine you and I are passing a basketball back and forth except you're wearing goggles and all of a sudden you're only getting 90% of the data of where's that basketball on its way to my hands now you're only getting 80% now you're only getting 70% of that visual information and you are practicing right you are getting good at catching a basketball when you only have a fraction of the visual information and now I put you back on the basketball court without the goggles you might be really good at passing that basketball around and catching that basketball right and so the idea that we could train and understand the biology of training to get the eyes from normal to Super normal performance I think it's an amazing area and one that we've really just started to dig into that's fantastic so this is a a new program at Stanford through the department of Opthalmology is it linked up at all with the WOAI performance Institute yeah actually there's been a lot of focus over the years I think in human performance and there's actually a new human performance uh Alliance and Center we've we've we've long had really run through the department of Orthopedics a human perform laboratory that's really you know much more about joints and muscles and strength and conditioning and stretching uh to layer onto that now a real understanding of how vision is operating you know it's interesting let's go back to the example of concussion you know we've got I don't know about 800 Varsity student athletes in all the different sports at Stanford and you might have a student athlete come in and say you know something doesn't feel right I got a little hit on the head head I feel like my vision is a little bit messed up maybe I've got a mild concussion you could imagine doing some of these tests on some of these performance athletes for example and saying well gosh you you look normal but actually they used to be operating at a supern normal rate and this is a noticeable decrement for them and so just starting to study and understand what's the difference between normal and supernormal how do we go back and forth between those two how do we measure that difference and maybe ultimately how do we train into that difference I think it's going to be exciting and not just for athletes you know for for regular people you know you talk about driving at night is there a solution where we could train our eyes to be better at driving at night and I don't know maybe reduce the number of accidents that happen out in the world so well certainly there's um physical training protocols which are redefining what a 60-year-old or a 70-year-old could look like and feel like and be able to perform like why not do the same for vision um so I don't think there's anything um Supernatural or greedy about doing it I think that's the excitement of biology and neuroplasticity that you can extend it forward as opposed to just trying to wire up correctly during development this is a perfect time for me to ask you a question that I'd love a clear answer on if it's possible it's not always possible which is could you define 2020 vision and a few of the variants so so that any person could understand it so we think of 2020 as perfect vision what does that mean what would degraded Vision look like whatever those numbers are and then what would above normal super normal vision look like and is it true that fighter pilots have supranormal Vision yeah that's another population like like like many athletes of of people who may have sort of better than normal vision 2020 you know we Define almost everything we do based on you know kind of a average not sick human being adult whatever it is right and so 2020 Vision means that you can read the smallest letters at 20 feet away that the average healthy person can read at 20 feet away so you can read at 20 what they can read at 20 okay now if you have worse than 2020 Vision maybe you have 2025 Vision 2040 Vision maybe you have 2200 Vision which on the ey chart at the office is like the Big E at the very top is 2200 Vision that means you can read at 20 feet what a normal person could read at 200 feet right so you've got pretty limited lower Vision we can measure down to like 2400 28 800 at that point we're getting into like gosh can you count how many fingers I'm holding up you know that kind of thing and then ultimately hand motion can you even tell if my hand is moving in this side of your vision or this side of your vision and then ultimately after that light perception can you tell if the room lights are on or off right and that's kind of the edge of of being actually fully blind we call Legal blindness in the United States typically 2200 or worse and is it true that there are people who are legally blind that are out there driving as we're having this conversation I I have to imagine that that is unfortunately the case but it shouldn't be because those people obviously are really severely impaired and and and and that's obviously quite dangerous so so so that's 2020 now it gets worse 2040 2080 20000 can it get better yeah it turns out that people can be sort of on the other end of that curve and so we could have athletes and fighter pilots or people who have had lasic surgery who are 2015 2010 if you're 2010 that means you can see at 20 feet what the average person needs to be only 10 feet away to see right and so you've got better than normal vision and people do get to that through a variety of ways and so it is possible to have better than 2020 Vision does the degree of visual Acuity because that's really what we're talking about here differ dramatically between the two odd and most healthy people no um you know remember we talked about you're born with something like 2200 Vision takes you a couple of years and it could be a little bit asymmetric 2200 Vision yeah that reminds me um I've seen images of what babies can see you know parents love looking at their child and thinking that their child is looking right back at them and indeed often the child is looking right back at them and your face to your child sorry to break this to you folks is incredibly blurry even at that close distance for probably the first 6 to eight months even before you come into sharp relief they're not seeing the fine details of your face yeah so smile big that's right smile big keep those eyebrows dark right and keep cooing at them because they can hear pretty well early yeah the Optics of newborn babies are just dreadfully bad but they need visual stimulation now other species na you know Hawks uh Raptors owls that hunt uh they can naturally have 2010 28 Vision right so much better vision and that's just their normal vision as best as has been measured so so there's definitely the potential for us to have better than 2020 Vision now all of this we call Visual Acuity and just to be clear for everyone that's the vision in the very center of your vision like when you're reading or looking that's the very center of your vision our vision is actually actually described variably as a hill of vision the peak is in the center that's let's say 2020 in most people right but it's it's normal to have that slope off and our visual Acuity your ability to read the eye chart on the edges of your vision if you can read the Big E that's pretty normal like you would be 2200 out on the edges of your vision and we would feel like yep that's pretty normal um so so our highest Acuity Visions in the center and that's a big part of why we spent a lot of time using those eye muscles to look around right we got to we got to get a little bit of a high Acuity view of what's around us uh fill in fill in the gaps of what our what our brain is is interpreting our peripheral world to look like it's almost like we have two visual systems we have a high Acuity High pixel density camera in the middle and then surrounding that is a pretty low resolution but very fast detector camera yes yeah yeah you mentioned lasic but I want to make sure that before we talk about lasic that we talk a little bit about contact lenses is there any detriment to having a piece of glass or a piece of plastic on the front of your eye all the time and the reason I ask is not because I think we should live necessarily exactly like our ancestors but it's a pretty bizarre adaptation to put a lens directly onto the front of the eye you have to imagine that the cells and tissues there are accustomed to getting a certain amount of oxygen they're accustomed to getting a certain amount of interaction with the environment and and you also now adding another surface the way that the tears are going to interact with the um you know with the corny of the eye are probably changed and who knows maybe it doesn't make any negative difference at all but you know putting a contact lens on the front of the eye is you know about as close to putting a device on your brain as I can think of except for maybe the clear uh implant yeah yeah that's a great question now first of all um I want to distinguish uh there are few really medical uses for different kinds of contact lenses like scleral contact lenses for people have certain diseases there are other kinds but I think what we really want to talk about right now is just kind of the run-ofthe-mill I want to get my prescription taken care of but instead of wearing glasses I'm going to wear contacts contacts even the newest generation contacts yes they sort of uh change the tiar Dynamics on the surface of your ey they um uh they decrease the oxygen you know diffusion that's just sort of out in the air onto the surface of our eye onto the cells that are on the surface of our eye but most of us especially as we're younger have enough tier film Reserve enough oxygen Reserve that we can easily tolerate these polymer gel soft contact lenses and and wear them happily the advantage of contact lenses over glasses purely from the perspective of correcting your vision is that there's different elements of of of of the shape of your eye that need to be corrected if you need corrective lenses and so for example if your the basketball shape of your eye is a little too steep or a little too shallow that's what the standard glasses correct uh you may have been told that you have something called a stigmatism that's where instead of having a basketball shaped eye you have a slightly football-shaped eye it's not round in the same dimensions on both axes and again glasses can correct that but then there's higher order aberration in our corneas in the clear window in the front of our eyes or or to some degree in the lens inside the eye that are that are focusing the light that the glasses prescription can't correct but if you have nice smooth contact lens on the front it can correct so a lot of people who wear glasses and contacts will report that they have a much higher quality of vision with their contact lens correction than with their glasses correction and again in service of enjoying the best Vision that you can enjoy in your daily life that's an upside to seeing if contact could work for you now there's another element though and that's like gosh is there a risk of contact lenses and especially as we age um we have less tear film Reserve so contacts may become less tolerable as we age and the other thing is being really good about the cleaning because you know the contacts can trap bacteria or fungus and if you get a corial infection from a contact lens it actually can be quite devastating to your cornea even if you successfully treat the infection you can be left with some corneal scarring thankfully this happens very rarely but when it does happen it can be quite difficult on you know on the person thereafter to sort of suffer through having maybe a scar from that infection on the surface of their cornea that they that leads to some blurring vision for example so we always recommend that if you're going to wear contacts that you be really attentive to whether you're tolerating them well and then also to be really attentive to the recommended use and cleaning of the contact lenses I actually recommend that even though they're a little more expensive to afford that people should almost always be just using the daily contact lenses that they don't have to clean or use for uh you know two weeks or four- week period so these are disposable contact lens disposable and I hate to think of you know I don't know filling our oceans or what have you with more more more polymer plastic but at least the contact lenses are small and it's much safer for your eye to use a daily disposable than to use a two we or a 4 we and be responsible for the cleaning the other thing to be really responsible about is sleeping in them overnight because overnight when your eyelids are closed of course now you're getting even less oxygen to the surface of your eye and actually most bacteria especially many of the Infectious bacteria to our bodies and to the surface of our eye are actually bacteria that don't really like oxygen and so we've got a low risk of getting bacterial infections on the surface of our eye but if we use contacts too much don't clean them or sleep in them overnight when our eyelids are closed and now there's even less oxygen kind of helping keep the surface more more clean if you will uh that increases the risk a lot so being really good with the recommended use and cleaning of the contacts is critical considering daily use contacts you don't have to and look most contacts are going to be the two we or four-week kind where you put them in the cleaning solution overnight each time give them a good rinse and put them back in the next say and again most people 99.99 some perent of people are going to do just fine with that follow the instructions and never get into trouble as we age they're going to become less tolerable people are going to say I used to wear my contacts for 12 hours now my eyes feel really dry after six or eight or 10 hours maybe some years after that they say gosh I could barely use it for four hours I only use them when I go out on a Saturday night uh and and that's okay you can you can you can back off as you need to back off but in the meantime if it helps you especially in the younger decades if it helps you really enjoy uh Your Best Vision great what about UV protection in eyeglass lenses Andor contacts um I've dealt with many questions about blue light I am not somebody who believes that all blue light is terrible I think it's important to avoid Bright Lights of any wavelength late at night if you want your melatonin produ to be normal and you want to sleep well doesn't matter if you're wearing blue blockers or not if you're just under blasting Bright Lights it's going to suppress your melatonin and yet some people enjoy blue blockers for that reason nowadays A lot of people wear blue blocker glasses or blue blocking lenses or conts throughout the entire day thinking that blue light is bad for our eyes during the day I happen to subscribe to the idea that we want as much bright light as we safely can tolerate during the day ideally from sunlight in order to set our circadian rhythm and yet a lot of eyeglasses and a lot of contact lenses out there have UV a Andor UVB blocking features to them so what are your thoughts on this and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong and revise my my stance on this um yeah what what what do you think about this UV AB blocking yeah it's a good it's it's a it's really important to distinguish that UV light on the light spectrum is right next to blue light red lights on the other end and of course infrared is beyond that and our eyes other animals can see these but our eyes can't see infrared that's why we call it Beyond red and we can't see ultraviolet as we call it Beyond Violet UV light is right next to Blue Light UV light is known to have a lot of adverse effects it's not really good for our skin and therefore you know we really want to avoid Sunburn and kind of UV D you know exposure and damage on our skin similarly it's not really good on our eyes and it affects both the ocular surface a little bit in terms of like kind of how dry or irritable your eyes might feel for some people and certainly over the long term UV light will accelerate the formation of cataract which is a blurring of an oxidative blurring of the lens inside the eye profound UV light can be damaging to the retina if you're getting way too much on the inside um so uh so blocking UV light I believe is just absolutely standard in every pair of eyeglasses and uh I don't know actually how much to what degree the different kinds of contact lenses also filter at least UV light now blue blockers blue blocking glasses is totally different and as I say like I think almost all glasses because the Plastics almost all glasses are not made of glass anymore they're made of plastics uh but I think almost all of them now filter the UV light which again is like probably the safe move for our eyes and periocular environment around the eye environment um so uh blue blockers you know that's been a huge fat and I'll tell you the last three years through the pandemic everybody getting on their computer hours in front of Zoom meetings where we used to walk from building to building for a meeting things like that um I you know I I remember you know like the sort of big uptic in these kinds of questions and I'm not sure that there's any that blocking blue is helpful in any way and as you say it may actually play into sort of circadian entrainment of our natural daily Rhythm so so I think blocking UV is a good idea and I think it's pretty standard um you know they make glasses by the way that actually react to UV light they're called transitions there maybe a few different brands I don't know uh but but you know these are the sunglasses that are clear except then they turn dark if you're out in the sunlight and it's not just any sunlight it's actually the UV uh wavelengths that that cause the chemical reaction in the glasses to turn from from Clear see-through to to sunglass blocked glasses and um you may notice if you if any of you out there are using these kinds of glasses uh that they don't work in the car you'll wear them in the car and they won't go to sunglasses even though it's sunny out and again that's because all standard car glass also filters UV that's why if you're riding around in the car and it's sunny out you've got your hand you know up next to the window uh wearing a t-shirt you never get a sunburn through the car window anymore because all our car glass is also filtering UV light for us so so that's a very informative answer and before we started recording you and I were discussing this practice of morning sunlight viewing which again I highly recommend over and over and you pointed out that low solar angle sunlight so sunlight Light low in the sky viewed for maybe 10 minutes a morning and again not forcing oneself to look at it and stare but blinking as needed is not going to cause extensive UV damage to the eyes it's really the when the sun is directly overhead um that we're getting a lot of UV which raises this other question which is for people that don't wear corrective lenses and therefore are not blocking UV light to the eyes um what should they do are they in trouble should they be wearing a brimmed hat brimmed Hat's a great idea that'll get rid of a lot of the direct light into the eye of course you still have reflected light off of surfaces uh and that that can include UV light of course um you know wearing sunglasses outside even if you don't have corrective lenses you know it's may may also be more comfortable to wear sunglasses outside um so so these are all fine you know at the end of the day it's probably not making a huge difference in the health of your eye whether you've spent the last 50 years wearing sunglasses really dogmatically for your out time or not um you know if you were going to develop let's just say age related cataracts inside your eyes which we'll all get cat if we all live to 120 we all get cataracts you know it's going to happen some people younger some people older maybe if you were really dogmatic about wearing your UV blocking sunglasses maybe you'd get your your cataracts at 75 years old instead of 72 years old it may not be a huge difference in that regard um so again not something to be super stressed I think it's I think it's more a question of just what are you comfortable in uh and then certainly I will say the the other advantage of a wide brim hat is it's keeping sun off of your face and these are the you know some of the especially the upturn portions of your face like the cheeks and the nose these are the some of the most common places to get some of the skin cancers that you can get over a lifetime of sunlight exposure um so you know the wide Brin haap is is it's helping you for that as well can't help but ask about Comfort at very levels of brightness I'm the person that when sitting in a cafe or something and on a bright day I can be directly across from somebody like you who seems to be perfectly fine without sunglasses and maybe even we're shaded under an umbrella or something of that sort and I'm squinting like crazy is it normal for there to be a pretty wide variation in sensitivity to light and does this have anything to do with the lightness or darkness of the eyes you have brown eyes I have green eyes but is there any real correlation there yeah you know it's a good question I I don't know if it's been formally studied but I will tell you like I have the same impression you do which is that if you have uh a blue eyes or light colored eyes that you're more likely to have more sensitivity we know that there's differences in the iris muscles that constrict and dilate in response to light uh for example when you go into your eye care provider and they're going to do a dilated exam and they put the eye drops in your eye that dilate the eyes they sort of change the the the nerve impulses onto the iris muscle so the iris dilates and you get those big big open eyes um people with blue eyes we absolutely know blue or Hazel or light colored eyes uh you put that eye drop to dilate their eyes it's going to lasts four 6 eight hours whereas in a brown-eyed person often the dilation only lasts one two 4 hours so there's clearly biological differences between the irises and their muscles and maybe the nerve that feed those muscles uh between lyed people and and darker eyed people uh and that may also therefore relate to this differential sensitivity that some people have you know if you're not able to constrict your eyes in the bright light as effectively you're going to find that bright light more frustrating more annoying uh you know even painful people will feel like their eyes are cramping almost uh as they try to get that those eye muscles to activate to bring down down the pupil and block some of that excess light from getting in interesting yeah let's go back to lasic what is lasic and should I get lasic eye surgery does it does everyone need lasic can it help every can it make us you know super physiological you know can it make me a 2010 you know often it can I'll just say that you know right up front it is amazing people will come out of lasic surgery uh uh better than 2020 but uh the cornea weal about before that's the Clear Window on the front of your eye all the light has to get through there and we talked about before already like if your cornea is misshapen if the basketball shape of it is too uh too shallow or too steep then you're going to need glasses to see at distance and also at near if it's too football instead of basketball then it's going to be what we call a stigmatism and uh and then you can't uh you need a correction for that instead of correcting with glasses that sort of help shape the light so it can go through your slightly off shaped cornea instead of wearing contact lenses which also shape the light just as it's entering your cornea right on the surface of the eye you can just reshape the cornea and the way lasic does that there's a few different versions of lasic uh but basically the way the lasic does that is it actually ablates or uh uh gets rid of a little ring or rim of that corn tissue so that for example if you were a little shallow and you got rid of a little bit of that tissue around the edge with the laser the Las lasic you know starts with the word laser if you got rid of that edge tissue then you're sort of making it a little more basketball shaped right or if you were too steep on your cornea and you use the laser to kind of shave off a little bit of the the tip of that basketball right then you're flattening it out flattening out the cornea so it's that kind of reshaping and the technology has come so far that the lasic procedures can actually correct not just the regular aberration that we talked about but also some of these higher order aberration and there are different monikers for this kind of lasc it's all I think become fairly standard but wavefront guided where it's actually using light waves to measure with a very exact localization exactly how much and where to laser for each individual eye to make that cornea pass the light as ideally as possible now one or a few percent of patients will actually have a dry eye problem so after lck because it does interfere a little bit with those corneal nerves for example and I and I do think that if you're a person who already has dry eye hopefully if you're asking your eye surgeon about lasic hopefully you're being counseled that if you have dry eye this might not be a good idea for you just like contacts might not be a good idea for you if you already have a lot of dry eye um but for a lot of people especially a lot of younger people it's quite common I I I think the statistics suggest maybe 15 or 20% of people who would benefit from lasic you know who who would we who would otherwise be wearing glasses may get lasic at some point in their life and um you know I used to joke you know lasic it costs more money than a pair of glasses but it doesn't cost more money than 10 pair of prescription glasses over the course of a decade or two you know and so I used to joke that gosh if uh if everyone had to have laser eye surgery for their best vision and someone came along and said hey I've got an invention you don't have to have laser eye surgery anymore it rests on the ears and the bridge of your nose I call them glasses could they have sold those for a th000 $2,000 a pair I don't know maybe but you know there's kind of a cultural element of saying you know like I don't want to wear glasses you know I'd love to be able to walk around without relying on glasses or contacts of course people are very athletic or spending a lot of their time doing Athletics they may be quite irritated to have to deal with glasses or contacts people who have very severe prescriptions I mean if you wake up and you can't even really you know you're fumbling for your glasses on the bedside table because you have such a strong strong uh prescription you can't even see what it says on the alarm clock next to the bed you know these are all groups of patients who like really change their daily lives by getting out of glasses or contacts and taking advantage of lasic and in I don't know 99% of the time it's going to be like a safe comfortable outcome for the patient do they do lasic on kids um there are certain conditions uh unusual Coral conditions where procedures like Las at used but I believe uh it's ideal to not do it on children uh or even even young teenagers and the reason goes back to what we were talking about before you are much more likely to change the shape of your eye the and therefore the prescription you need and therefore what exactly the lasic would laser while you're still in those growing years and you really want to be able to say hey my eyeglasses prescription has not changed in the last two or three or five years because if you do lace sick and then your eye keeps changing shape then by the next year all of a sudden the L lasic is not doing you're backing glasses again right you can do a touch-up lasic do a little bit more but it's generally you know you're going to be a happier person if you've reached that point in your life and maybe that's maybe that's your late teens more commonly it's into the 20s where your eye has stopped changing its prescription every year you've been steady and stable for some years and now you do the lace B and it could easily last you a decade you mentioned dry eye get a lot of questions about dry eye and a few years ago I think you and I were at a meeting and someone who is very woven in with the companies that build and test drugs for different aspects of vision health said you know what the field really needs is a treatment that works for dry eye and I thought dry eye like of all things like why dry and then the more I learned about it I realized that there are millions and millions of people that really suffer from dry eye and for whom standard drops are just not working so what underlies dry eye is it some deficiency in the lacrone glands that produce tears for the eye and and I think of Tears is just kind of salty water um and I wonder if they are more than that is there an oil in there and if we know what's in tears why can't somebody just manufacture something that works as well as tears yeah you know it turns out you know we we we've got a lot of other eye diseases but by far the most common eye disease and and I've been told by far the most common eye treatment you know purchased by anyone now granted it's almost always over the counter things like artificial tears is for dry eye and uh in part that's because as we age our tier quantity goes down and our tier quality goes down and so what do those two mean we have two different major elements to tear and as you alluded to one is the saltwater P of part of the tear and those are made primarily by the lacrimal gland and there's a steady drip of those tear onto the ocular surface as well as reflexive tearing right if you get an eyelash in your eye or or you cry you're G your laal gr will actually squeeze out extra saltwater tears uh onto the surface of the eye and so so that's that's where most of the sort of wet part is coming from but there's also essential oils critical oils these come from other types of glands including glands in our eyelids called mayian glands and the oils form a surface over the saltwater part of the tier film and and also intermix into the teers and as we age we go down in the quantity of both saltwater part of our teers and oil part of our teers but also the quality and in particular the oil parts uh uh can often be seen to be going down more quickly the the ey drop industry has pretty much solved for replacing the saltwater part of your teers right you can get either bottles of preserve preservative containing you know you could use that bottle all month or for for a month or two or you can buy these strips of preservative free artificial teers which are really basically like the saltwater component and you can use those preservative free ones we have patients using them every hour if they need to right you're not going to hurt anything with preservative free artificial tears you just drop them in just drop them in yeah either ey as often as you want or need when you feel it it's exacerbated in the world we live in uh uh especially these days now with more time on computer it turns out that when you read including when we maybe used to read more books than we do now but also read on the computer or stare at the computer screen or work on the computer or actually just even watch the TV done very careful studies you blink less when you're doing any of those activities and when you blink less you're redistributing the tears less effectively and you squeezing out less of the tears including less of the oils uh as effectively as you could be when you're blinking and so um so between aging tier quality tier quantity a lot of our activities uh we're kind of in this losing proposition now now I mentioned that uh we're pretty good at replacing the wet salty part of our teers but actually as an industry we haven't really figured out a how to really effectively replace the oily part and the oils do a few things including when you have a layer of oil on top of a layer of water the water is less likely to evaporate and so the oils help hold the tears on the surface of your eye and so if we're not making as many or as good oils uh as part of our teer film that's uh that's also like kind of working against the saltwater part of our tear um so yeah as an industry as a as a community uh that we haven't really figured out how to get the oil parts Sol for either by effectively replacing the oils or treating our eyelids in a way kind of rejuvenating those o oil glands getting them to kind of go back to their youthful State again you know so the the eyes including the eyelids and the oil glands unfortunately they're aging just like the rest of our body so so this is this this is one of the major features uh is uh is dry eye and and uh and it's tough on patients because you feel it it's really tough because you feel it yeah I have yet another experience to report where when I had the blepharitis which fortunately was transient I also experienced that every time I would blink I could feel the blink and boy I'll tell you I we all most of us take for granted uh what a pleasure it is to not observe the blinking of our eyes because for those I think it lasted about two weeks every time I blink I'd feel an almost sandpaper like experience it was wasn't particularly painful but it was very uncomfortable because you're suddenly conscious of every blink and it's very distracting now that resolved when the blefaritis resolved but I can't even imagine what it would be like to deal with that all day long every day really Dreadful yes it really is and and so you're absolutely right it's a very it's one of our really big unmet needs and and although for most people with dry eye it can be managed with just the regular over-the-counter artificial teardrops you can buy at the GR grocery store over the counter at the pharmacy for a subset of people who have really much more severe symptoms with the dry eye it's it's really it's hard it's a really hard thing to have to live with all the time and and we Counsel on the use of Tears we Counsel on the use of uh eyelid cleaning like we talked about before where you take either these eyelid scrubs or a little dilute baby shampoo to keep those eyelashes really clean that keeps those oil glands functioning at their top capacity for you uh so that you're maximizing high quality teer production reducing inflammation is also important whether that's inflammation from allergy and of course a lot of people's dry eye gets much worse in the spring with seasonal allergies when pollen is around if you have dust allergies in your home uh uh that worsens your symptomatic dry eye um uh or other forms of inflammation there's a there's an element of dry eye that we actually think is inflammation kind of working against our tear glands and and in fact some of the prescription drops now to help combat more severe dry eye uh are anti-inflammatory or even lowd dose steroid types of eye drops um so I think these are all uh sort of Next Generation treatments I think at the at the really Leading Edge of Next Generation treatment is trying to better understand the nerves on the cornea and ocular surface and if there are ways that we could better treat them and help help regenerate and rejuvenate kind of how the nerves and the and the tissue cells are interacting underneath that tiar film and that's where for some patients we can actually use uh either for example blood serum your blood serum is actually very rich in growth factors and many of those growth factors it turns out empirically are really helpful for people with dry eye so if you're one of those people who's been really struggling with with dry eye you might ask your eye care provider hey I I heard about serum tears is that something that could help me serum tears so is this PRP is this platelet rich plasma related but but not the plate platelet rich portion at least not yet they can draw your blood spin out all the cells you're left with the kind of liquid part of your blood that's the serum and then they can dilute that with some salt water maybe with some preservatives in some cases you could keep it in your freezer thaw out the bottle when you're ready to use it you know each few weeks and uh and then then use it just like an eye dropper bottle and those serum tear uh actually can be very helpful for people with with much more advanced or severe hardto control dry eye symptoms uh companies are really trying to figure out hey what are the most important parts of the the serum can we just identify and package just the growth factor and uh and turn that into a product for dry eyye patients and so there's a lot of research on the ocular surface and dry eye going into um going into that space right now I'll tell you the one other recommendation that I always give patients there's a fair amount of evidence that if you're getting too much of some of these preservative chemicals uh which of course if you're going to use an ey drop bottle for a month it should have a preservative in it right so that you don't open the bottle and then it grows bacteria a couple weeks later and now you're you're you're you know you're using contaminated eye drops uh so for bottles it's Ty to have preservatives but I really recommend for patients if they're using anything more than a couple drops here and there uh for their dry eye control to actually go for one of the preservative free artificial tiers they come in lots of Brands I'm sure the house brands at at any of the pharmacies use them too I make them too and these are the ones that come in like strips plastic strips and you break one off you break off the little cap you can use a much as you want all day you have to throw that one out if you have anything left over you have to throw it out at the end of the night and the next day break off a new one because there's no preservatives and once you open it you don't want bacteria to grow in that salt water right um but it's really good because the preservatives can be very irritating or even inflammatory to the ocular surface to the surface of our eyes so we really do want to if we're using more than a drop or two upgrade they cost a little bit more money they're still over the counter upgrade yourself to the preservative free artificial te those are great recommendations I'm also really interested in this serum thing uh because you know were this discussion taking place 10 years ago and I rais PRP platelet rich plasma there would probably be a lot of eye rolls no pun intended because I think myself and a lot of other people in the it's called the sort of standard scientific and medical community looked at platelet rich plasma right alongside stem cell therapies because they were cheek to jowl back then as you recall before the FDA regulations about stem cell claims which we will get to um of course PRP was suggested as a source of stem cells it turns out there are very few if any true stem cells in PRP and yet now as I understand it PRP is an FDA approved protocol for injection into uh the uterus injection into pretty much every tissue and organ system of the body in order to quote unquote rejuvenate it and here I'm not promoting PRP and yet it is a very common practice now in more standard medical clinics but it started off kind of Niche even gray Market kind of underground it's diverged from stem cell therapies and we're going to talk about major modes of vision loss in a moment and this horrible situation that happened down in Florida of a clinic injecting stem cells into patients eyes to recover vision and it actually blinded them so we'll talk about stem cell therapies but for the record is PRP something that's now standard in major opol Opthalmic clinics excuse me including your department at Stanford are you drawing out blood spinning it down taking plasma taking serum and re-injecting it or reapplying it to patients eyes not not yet in Opthalmology uh in eye clinics I I would say we're sort of like right now on the edge of uh groups are starting to study that is it safe is it valuable is it any better for certain conditions like on the ocular surface than serum teers for example this sort of diluting a patient's own own blood serum uh so so it's being studied it's a very active area know it turns out that this PRP uh plasma has uh you know again like a high concentration of growth factors that's probably what's responsible for a lot of the kind of quote tissue Rejuvenation effects uh uh be that be they as they may but but it's being studied but it's definitely not a standard of care yet uh at least in in Opthalmology space and and you know I think whenever there's something really new it really deserves to be properly studied we talked before about you know at first you're going to do trials where you just test it carefully and a few people maybe a few of the most severely effective affected patients be really thoughtful about uh you know the ethics of trying out for safety then as you develop a little understanding of the safety you really want to eventually get to properly controlled randomized what people in the community often call double blind trials but we in Opthalmology like to call Double masked trials blind is a bad word we do blind trials yeah yeah so you really want properly controlled trials testing is it really working is it really deserve the claims that people are making and that has not yet really come to fruition at that level for Opthalmology or I care at so we've been talking a lot about normal visual development ey checks and some of the more typical challenges that people have with their Vision but we haven't yet touched on some of the really debilitating stuff things like glaucoma things like retinitis Pigmentosa macular degeneration the things that if we could we would all avoid and yet are out there in the world at pretty high rates I'm sure you'll share with us what those rates are and as bad as these things are there are ways to detect an offset set their progression so that people don't necessarily lose their Vision so if you could could you share with us what are the major forms of vision loss in childhood and in adulthood and what can each and all of us do in order to find out if we have one of these conditions and therefore treat it effectively yeah that's great you know let's start by just reminding ourselves what are the major causes of vision loss and these are going to differ where you are in the world but the major the number one cause of low vision is actually refractive error people who need glasses and especially in other countries affordability access can't even get glasses okay so that's just refractive error but that's fundamentally correctable the next most common cause of vision loss is cataract cataract is the blurring the Aging of the lens inside the eye behind the cornea we talked about how that is responsible for focusing light under the back of the eye it also has to be clear enough that the light gets through the lens and a cataract is a normal aging process you know as I said if we all live to a 100 or 110 years old we'll all get cataracts we'll all need cataract surgery we actually as you know in the eye clinic we see cataracts years or even decades before they're affecting your vision in a meaningful way so the the cataracts are forming and that's okay but at some point they get bad enough that it's time to take them out we've actually solved for cataract surgery pretty efficiently uh we can do a four to eight minute surgery maybe if we're taking our time it's 10 or 12 minutes of surgical time take out a cataract it works beautifully 99 something per of the time we put a plastic a clear plastic lens inside the eye exactly where your lens used to be and there's even lenses that can Flex or focus light from far and near so cataract is fundamentally a there's still room for improvement but there's it's fundamentally a solved problem uh the problem is is that worldwide there aren't enough cataract surgeons there's not access to care the Machinery or the lenses um cost too much money in developing countries to get out to the number of people who would need them so it's actually just again an access to care cataract is a reversible treatable easily treatable problem but it's number two on the list of causes of vision loss in the world because we don't have enough access to care we need a lot more sort of programming around Global Opthalmology Global Eye Care to solve for cataract uh just to bring that solution to countries around the world then after that you start hitting the eye diseases that LE lead to what are currently irreversible nonreversible causes of vision loss the number one cause of irreversible vision loss in the world is glaucoma so what is glaucoma glaucoma is actually probably a little cluster or constellation of diseases that we lump together it's a degenerative disease like a neurod degeneration we talk about nurd degenerations in the brain like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's glaucoma is a neurod degenerative disease it happens instead of affecting one or different area in your brain it happens to affect the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain and we need our optic nerves carry all the visual information from the eye to the brain and so if your optic nerve is degenerating in glaucoma and I should add there are other optic neuropathies uh so-called diseases of optic nerve degeneration for example you can get a stroke of the optic nerve you can have an inflammatory disease like multiple sclerosis called optic ntis that affects the optic nerve uh so you can get other optic nerve diseases but glaucoma is by far the most common optic neuropathy and the problem is is just like you know just like spinal cord injury which is also part of the central nervous system right the brain the spinal cord the retin and the optic nerve that's the central nervous system and there's no regeneration and that's why spinal cord injury leads to permanent paralysis while optic nerve injury or op optic nerve degeneration unfortunately leads to permanent vision loss so in the case of glaucoma how do we get ahead of that glaucoma has two major risk factors one is increasing age there are actually infantile and pediatric glaucomas unfortunately and those can be much more aggressive much more damaging when they present so early in kids uh in babies and in children most of the kind of run-of-the Mill glaucoma usually Pres presents in adulthood and even in in the Aging adult so much more common after 50 or 60 or 70 years old increasing the other main risk factor for glaucoma is increasing eye pressure the eye actually you know it stays inflated it's a balloon it has to stay inflated we need some amount of eye pressure to keep our eye as a as an inflated balloon but if the eye pressure goes too high and we we talked about this before you won't even feel it if it slowly gets too high if the eye pressure goes too high that causes glaucoma and um and that's one of the things that we talked about you really include in a comprehensive eye exam when you're just getting a screening checkup at your eye care provider at your optometrist or opthalmologist office they're going to check your pressure and just as a screening tool check to make sure it's not too high we can treat glaucoma today by trying to reduce the impact of that high pressure by lowering the eye pressure so we have treatments for glaucoma that Target the eye pressure we have medications like eye drops we have lasers that can be used inside the eye that can also lower the eye pressure and ultimately if we need them we also have surgeries that can also provide an outflow that lets the fluid out of the eye in a controlled way so that the eye pressure can be brought back down into normal ranges again the reason that glaucoma ends up being the number one cause of irreversible blindness in the world is number one we can't get those therapies everywhere in the world the affordability of ey drops the access to lasers or surgical procedures Around The World Isn't equal to what it is here and even within our country you know people may not be accessing Health Care effectively to get screened for glaucoma or to get treated for glaucoma the other big problem with glaucoma is that it affects our peripheral vision first and only very late in the disease does it pinch in and finally pinch off the center of our vision in typical glaucomas and that's a real problem because we don't notice if our peripheral vision is down you know our peripheral vision isn't that good to begin with and if you're driving and you can see a pedestrian step off the sidewalk you think your peripheral vision is fine but actually your per peripheral vision could already start being damaged by glaucoma and you won't notice it in regular daily life and that's where the importance of screening and early detection really comes in for glaucoma what we don't have for glaucoma we can come back to like kind of what's The Cutting Edge or the future uh in these eye diseases what we don't have are treatments that really Target the optic nerve degenerative process and uh we can come back and talk about that so that's coma and optic neuropathies then the next two major causes of currently largely irreversible vision loss are age related macular degeneration and then diabetic retinopathy now age related macular generation is just like it sounds major risk factor is age it's very common and actually in the developed world you know countries that are more developed also countries that have a larger Caucasian white population it's more common in certain populations than in others um it actually is you know definitely a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly population for example in the United States um and uh there's two forms of macula degeneration but they both end up targeting the same part the same part of the retina and that part of the retina is really like the rods and the con that we talked about before the rods do your low light vision at nighttime uh primarily your cones do color vision and bright light you know sort of normal lighting uh that we experience you know through most of our awake day and in that back of the retina you can have what's called dry macul degeneration which is a slow thankfully slow but slow Insidious disease that causes the degeneration of the rods and cones and also the support cells that help feed the rods and cones and take care of the rods and cones they're called RP cells retinal pigment epithelium it's not really critical of course uh the names of every different cell type but these are like the the the light collecting cells in our eyes and the retin and they degenerate in macular degeneration and in the dry form there's this slow degeneration but some percent of people with the dry form of macular degeneration will actually convert to What's called the wet form it's called wet because new blood vessels actually grow inappropriately under and even into the retina and new blood vessels unlike our mature blood vessels tend to be leaky and so that the fluid leaks out of those blood vessels gets into the rtina interferes with vision and that can lead to a much more acute loss of vision now we have some treatments for wet macular degeneration we have injections that go can go into the that actually fight against the molecules that are causing those new blood vessels to grow and these are antibodies that can be injected into the eye and they can be very effective controlling patients wet macul degeneration it's been a much bigger uphill battle even over the last decade of as advances are being made to to really try to knock back or or or slow down even the dry form of ma degeneration there was just some exciting news even just in the last few months the first uh successful Trials of a treatment for the dry form uh have just shown success in properly randomized controlled human clinical trials phase three clinical trials so it's an exciting time those new treatments are not going to be a Panacea they slow the progression like the an anatomic progression of the disease uh maybe by 20 or 25% so so patients are still going to get worse even with those treatments so there's still a lot more to be done to really knock back macular degeneration I want to mention you mentioned retinitis Pigmentosa that's like an inherited form of a type of macula degeneration it's also affecting the rods and cones and also the support cells the rpe cells in the back of the eye reiz Pigmentosa is an inherited form there are actually many different genes you could have that could leave to reiz Pig Pigmentosa in aggregate if you add up all the people with all those different genes uh and and it can be very devastating because it can really affect the vision knock out your vision very early in life including in children and even versions of that in babies but you add that all up it's still much less common and aggregate than macular degeneration but in a way it's you know quite a bit more severe because it does affect people much earli in life so so I sort of clumped those together Mac degeneration retinitis Pigmentosa degeneration of the rods and cones and the support cells the rpe support cells and then you you can't have this part of the discussion about what are the devastating eye diseases without bringing up diabetic retinopathy especially because diabetes unfortunately really continues to grow in especially let's say in the United States certainly in the developed world you know as we um especially type two diabetes with eating habits exercise habits contributing to a proliferation of some of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome obesity um we're unfortunately seeing a proliferation a growth in the number of people with diabetes and with the growth in diabetes unfortunately comes a growth of the complications of diabetes and one of the major complications of diabet abetes is damaged to the retina inside the eye and we call that diabetic retinopathy uh and there again some of the same damage that occurs especially when in diabetes again some new blood vessels are growing or blood vessels are leaky some of that can be treated with used to be lasers and now more commonly is often being treated with some of the same injectable drugs that are treating macular degeneration um but there's still a lot lot of vision loss with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy I think that's an area where again early screening making sure if you have diabetes that's that's an indication where you definitely have to be going in and getting your an at least annual exam with an eye care provider or having someone take a photograph of the inside of your eye and rate that photograph to say if you have any diabetic retinopathy or not in terms of interventions can we talk about diabetic retinopathy first because because of course type 1 diabetes is a failure to produce insulin relatively rare compared to type 2 diabetes which as you mentioned is proliferating in developing countries right this is probably unprecedented in the sense that developing countries have better Medical Care typically than non-developed countries um more opportunities for food nourishment and yet it's clearly a problem of overnourishment um insulin insensitivity obesity Etc is this type of diabetic written opathy that one observes the same for type 1 diabetics versus type two diabetics because my understanding is that type two diabetes this insulin insensitivity is a bit of a Continuum right I mean the type 1 diabetes is as far as I know is all or none you either make insulin or you don't but type two diabetes someone could be mildly in insulin insensitive or severely insulin insensitive and sometimes I'm told people are not necessarily obese and can have type 2 diabetes as well um certainly things like smoking and alcohol intake can contribute to that so how equivalent are type 1 and type two diabetes when framed Under the Umbrella of diabetic retinopathy yeah the the the time to presentation can be different uh a type 1 diabetic usually presents with sort of a cataclysmic sudden loss sudden sort of final loss of their ability to make insulin it usually presents in childhood or teenage years but can present you can have late on set type 1 diabetes because it's kind of a sudden presentation it can take some years after that to show any diabetic retinopathy whereas just because just just like you said type two diabetes can be on a Continuum and people can have like kind of a mild type two diabetes but kind of be you know getting along you know going through life kind of maybe not even realizing you know at first and so when you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes you've probably had some insulin resistance for the years prior to your diagnosis and so in that case you often can have um you know like you're you're at higher risk for presenting sooner with the the complications of diabetes like diabetic retinopathy now given that the actual retinopathy is very similar maybe the same uh between type 1 diabetes and type two diabetes and again it involves things like leaky blood vessels new blood vessel growth there's some amount of neurod degenerative dysfunction that just simply occurs uh so so uh you can have little little hemorrhages or bleeding spots in the retina tiny little strokes or microvascular uh uh events in the retina uh so that can happen in either type 1 or type two diabetes one once you start having the retinopathy it does look pretty similar so what can people do to prevent or treat diabetic retinopathy obviously the type 1 diabetic needs to take insulin in order to survive really uh type two diabetics need to get their obesity under control if they are in fact obese and get their blood sugar levels under control uh regardless uh that's my understanding and by extension are you seeing any reductions in diabetic retinopathy with people that are taking these um glucagonlike peptide mimics um like OIC which is used to treat type two diabetes yeah it's been a very exciting development for the diabetes field uh this new class of of um of uh anti-diabetic drugs and um so uh there you've touched on a couple of them there are a few key things uh for reducing the risk of diabetes or the impact of diabetes on your retina uh at risk of diabetic retinopathy uh or impact of diabetes on your retina uh one is as I mentioned get regular eye exams be screened you know any diabetic should be screened at least once a year uh with a with a good comprehensive retinal exam looking for any of these uh items the number one most important element to prevent diabetic retinopathy is to control your diabetes and having a real good blood sugar control keeping your hemoglobin A1c which is one of the blood tests that gets used to measure how your kind of long-term diabetes management is going uh that's really uh you know first and foremost the most important and that's been shown in large clinical trials they actually randomize patients to hey take care of your diabetes or do a real good job taking care of your diabetes and the patients who did a real good job taking care of their diabetes have much less diab diabetic retinopathy so that's number one it turns out that if you have high blood pressure and diabetes that blood pressure is also really damaging to your retina also by the way the kidneys and probably all the other organs that are suffering from the diabetic insult so in addition to controlling blood sugar really important to have blood pressure under great control now both blood sugar and blood pressure in type 2 diabetics especially if you're cat tching them early can be improved with some of these you know so-called Lifestyle Changes like improving eating watching what your food intake is you know getting good exercise trying to lose weight uh so uh these are definitely on that list of how do you get to good blood sugar and blood pressure control but suffice it to say blood sugar and blood pressure control right at the top and then also including the regular at least annual exams and then if diabetic retinopathy is detected and blood sugar and blood pressure control are not going to be enough for that patient we do have treatments as I mentioned before there are drugs that can be injected if your retina is getting you know kind of leaky blood vessels from diabetes uh there there are treatments that we can give the eye specifically to try to counter the diabetic retinopathy terrific in terms of glaucoma as you mentioned glaucoma is related to pressure although there is pressure normal glaucoma glaucoma is a death of the retinal gangling cells the neurons that connect the eye to the brain and once they are gone at least at this point in human history they can't be replaced although hopefully because of work that you've done and that other Laboratories are doing at some point that statement I just made will not be true and the rgc's can be replaced meanwhile what can and should be do to find out if they have glaucoma and to treat glaucoma and is it true that even if somebody has normal pressure that lowering their eye pressure further protects them against glaucoma yeah that's absolutely right so most important is to get screened with a formal exam at your optometrist or opthalmologist because you you won't notice you won't have any symptoms if your eye pressure is too high you won't not you're not likely to notice until very late in the disease if your peripheral vision is being damaged through the course of glaucoma so most important as to have a screening exam a good comprehensive screening exam will always include checking the eye pressures and also looking in the back of your eye the head of the optic nerve where all the fibers leave the eye and carry the optic nerve information back to the brain we can see that when we look inside your eye and uh and and glaucoma has a fairly characteristic look to it in the optic nerve head so so looking at the optic nerve head uh we have Imaging and peripheral vision testing that can also be included in those screening exams so if you really get a comprehensive screening exam you can very reliably detect if you have glaucoma to worry about or you're in the clear if you have glaucoma to worry about we have treatments and you're absolutely right whether you start with a abnormally high pressure or you start with a pressure that's on the face of it in the normal range in either case lowering the pressure has been shown in large properly controlled clinical trials to slow the progression of optic nerve damage and vision loss so absolutely in either case starting with high pressure or starting with normal pressure in either case you've got to lower the pressure further and as I mentioned we have ey drops those are usually the first line there's very good data that there's a very benign non-invasive laser it's not the same kind of laser that gets used for lasic but there's a benign very safe type of laser called selective laser tcul plasty SLT we call it and that's also very effective as a first line actually in the largest clinical trial uh from which the data have been coming out just even over the last few years it's called the light trial uh in the light trial patients with glaucoma were randomly assigned to either get the laser or the sort of most common first strongest eye drop and uh uh that gets used clinically and actually on many features they both worked at least as well but when looking out over the long term actually the laser had some advantages over the eye drop not in the least of which by the way it's very nice for patients to not have to like remember to use the eye drop every night and so um so that's quite helpful I think uh to to keep in mind as a treatment option uh early in the the disease of course if the ey drops Andor lasers are not enough early in the disease we also have surgical approaches to lower the eye pressure further you know even with all of our treatments all of these treatments stepping patients through all of this about 10 15 even 20% of patients will lose very meaningful functional vision and maybe 5 10 15% of patients especially depending where you are in the world will will go blind from glaucoma um including in you know quote unquote developed countries uh there's still a very significant cohort of patients that go blind legally blind and then you know absolute blindness I can't even tell if the lights are on in the room uh so it's it's it's devastating it's Insidious it's hard to detect early um and uh so glaucoma is still a tough one even with all of the treatments that we have okay so get your pressures checked folks and if you are prescribed drops take your drops I hear about patients not taking their drops which to me just seems like baffling but I guess having to do something day in and day out is can be Troublesome enough that unless people are losing their Vision very quickly or they are very afraid of losing their Vision sometimes they just neglect to take them it's hard it's hard for glaucoma eye drops it's hard for taking your blood pressure medication it's hard for a lot of medicines you know if you're if you're taking a medicine where you don't feel better you know if you have a headache and you take an aspirin or Tylenol or an ibuprofen uh you know you feel better you feel reinforced gosh taking that pill made sense right uh but if you're using an ey drop that like hey this is going to protect you for the next 20 years from losing your vision but you don't notice every day that anything's better and by the way the eye drops could be a little irritating maybe it stings a little for a minute or two when you put it in your eye some people are even less tolerant of the eye drops it's hard to feel motivated every day and we know that we call that compliance we know that it's very hard for patients to stay complying with prescribed medications where they don't feel or notice a difference in a daily way I realize that we can't stop aging yet um but right now you can't stop aging and age is a risk factor for glaucoma my understanding is so is smoking or vaping nicotine and so is alcohol and by that reasoning should people strive to drink less and smoke less including vaping nicotine less if they are concerned about glaucoma yeah and not just glaucoma macular degeneration actually macular degeneration has a couple major risk factors macular degeneration aging just like with glaucoma major risk factor smoking including exposure to second hand smoke major risk factor for macul degeneration and for the progression and vision loss potentially associated with macular degeneration in the case of macul generation there's also a couple of genes that we've sequenced the human genome and there's a couple of genes associated with macul generation too that's less true for your typical run-of-the-mill adult glaucoma there are genes for the Pediatric and infantile forms of glaucoma uh so yeah smoking 100% including vaping uh it's a no no for your eyes just like it's a no no for the rest of your body and uh it's tough as the eye doctor to have these conversations with patients because you kind of feel like well you know they must know it already and I'm trying to be the good guy in the room with the patient convince them to use their other medications but I it's it's important for us also as Eye Care Providers to reinforce the message with our patients a smoking terrible idea uh for macul degeneration also for glaucoma you know glaucoma's interesting because the optic nerve where it degenerates kind of right at the head of the optic nerve where it where it exits the eye it's what we call a watershed Zone it's kind of the edge of two blood vessel supplies and if either of those blood vessel supplies are a little bit short on blood or oxygen supply to that optic nerve head your glaucoma is going to get worse your optic nerve is going to be underfed and that's going to worsen this degenerative process just by not having all the right nutrients and oxygen so the other thing is that especially for glaucoma everything that we talk about for being heart healthy for the rest of our body is is almost certainly true for glaucoma and so I also always counsel glaucoma patients it's not just no smoking but eat healthy have a multivitamin uh get some exercise all those things that are good for your cardiovascular system are going to be good for your eyes in general and in particular if you have glaucoma uh or risk high risk for glaucoma I realized that smoking or vaping are problematic for glaucoma and for macular degeneration but we can't have a conversation about glaucoma without at least mentioning cannabis uh I did an entire episode about cannabis which touched on some of the real dangers of very high THC concentration in cannabis this lost me a few um followers I'm sure no problem because what was important was to convey the fact that the Cannabis that's out there nowadays comes in a variety of different strains and ratios of THC to CBD there's some severe risks of high THC especially in young males um although not always the point being that there are I want to be very clear about this because for whatever reason cannabis gets people really up in arms they always say it's not as bad as alcohol but guess what we did in the entire episode about alcohol and there the message is very clear zero is better than any and two a week is probably the limit and if you're an alcoholic zero is the rule so with cannabis it's clear by my read of the data that it can lower eye pressure which may undermine the progression of glaucoma somewhat but if people are smoking that cannabis is it therefore going to offset any gain that one would get from that cannabis and then how does one account for the potentially problematic aspects of very high THC cannabis yeah it's a great question and the truth is is that in most patients cannabis will lower the eye pressure the problem is is it really only lowers that eye pressure During the period that you're high from the Cannabis and the second problem is that smoking version of getting that cannabis into your system the smoking is bad for your lungs by the way the smoke from Cannabis or from cigarettes is also terrible for your dry eyes uh it causes inflammation it dries out your eyes so it's also very bad from that perspective now so the problem with cannabis is not that it doesn't work to lower the Press we want to lower the pressure that's great the problem with cannabis is that it's not realistic for most of our patients to prescribe could you go out and be high from Cannabis 24 hours a day seven days a week for the next 20 years I'm sure some people have tried and succeeded um but right that's not practical for most people and certainly for young people it could be really especially problematic I should say absolutely so so I recommend not taking that approach but that said I am definitely not a decer of it and now that there are edible forms I certainly have patients who are using it in a responsible way uh especially edible forms and uh and in select cases like that could make the difference for them helping to keep the pressure down and I'll say for example you know it turns out you you've talked a lot over the last couple years about dial curves and circadian rhythms it turns out that our eye pressure also under goes the Circadian rhythm and it's actually highest at night while we're sleeping kind of peaks in those early morning hours then hits a low throughout the early day and then kind of rises again throughout the afternoon into the evening and uh we have a lot of patients who they come into their Clinic visit their eye pressure looks normal but it's actually quite a bit higher when they're at home and that could explain some fraction of what we call normal pressure glaucoma it just looks normal during the day it's actually high at night and so in particular some patients I certainly have some patients who are using these products like let's say before bed and if it's controlling their eye pressure at night while they're asleep when the eye pressure would have been the highest it may confer some protective advantage over time but that's said again like for most patients it's not going to be the primary approach I'm most excited about the idea of uh um you know Laboratories or companies figuring out which the compounds Within These uh cannabinoids they're called within these products are actually responsible for lowering the eye pressure and could we get like a more potent eye specific longacting drug that's basically derived from the concept of cannabis but works better and is more compatible with not bringing along all the other adverse elements that can come with cannabis use you mentioned the Circadian rhythm and eye pressure and the fact that eye pressure is higher at night is there any advantage to sleeping in a particular position I know this might sound a little detailed but I seem to recall an abstract or a paper a few years ago at a meeting that you and I both attended where that said that if people slept with their head below their feet uh eye pressures were higher than if their head was slightly elevated above their feet and for somebody who has glaucoma this could make pretty substantial difference in terms of their eye pressures at precisely the hours of the night we should say in which they could be doing the most damage to the gangan cells yeah absolutely and we will sometimes counsel patients with severe glaucoma especially if they're you know poorly responsive to standard therapies or poorly able to tolerate standard therapies we'll counsel them if they're able to sleep up on a couple pillows get kind of a 30° sleep angle going what I don't want to do is interfere with a person's sleep because I just I fundamentally feel for the total health of the whole human being getting a good night's sleep is maybe more important than that 30 degrees and if trying to sleep up on pillows at 30 degrees is going to lead to kind of restless difficult sleep night I'd rather the patient get a good night's sleep but if they can tolerate it and especially if they have a sort of a a tough version of glaucoma then we'll we'll we'll let them try see if they can sleep up the other really interesting question that arises is uh does which side you sleep on affect uh which eye might have worse glaucoma glaucoma is almost always with with a few rare exceptions almost always a disease of two eyes but it can present very asymmetrically in fact it's quite common to have one eye kind of have worse damage than the other and and we don't know fundamentally why that is but one hypothesis was gosh maybe if you sleep on the right eye uh then your right eye will have worse glaucoma because the pressure is a little higher down below or maybe it's pressing on the pillow in a way or something like that there have been a couple Stu studies really really looking at that question a couple Studies have said the lower ey will have worse glaucoma couple Studies have said the higher I will have worse glaucoma so the upshot is it probably doesn't matter which side you sleep on we also know when you video people in their normal sleep pattern even if you feel you always fall asleep on the left side of your face people toss and turn all night probably over the course of the night you're spending a similar amount of time on each eye I'm glad you brought up that point in terms of macular degeneration I'm curious about the things that people can do as opposed to the don'ts in order to perhaps offset macular degeneration one of the things that I'm intrigued by are the results of Glenn jeffy's laboratory over at University College London I had known Jeff for probably a decade or more and he typically worked on animal models but then a few years ago started publishing studies and I believe there are now two published studies showing how red light exposure and near infrared light exposure done early in the day to the eye at a distance of about 2 feet for just a couple of minutes a few times a week could offset some of the vision loss associated with age related macular degeneration in people older than 40 that's my understanding of these studies and there's a theory there about enhancing function of mitochondria and photo receptors by reducing reactive oxygen species there's a whole mechanistic hypothesis but my question is is that the sort of protocol that produces significant enough offset of maca degeneration like we should all be looking at red lights in the morning um or is it still too early days in order to really conclude that I I I think the data is very compelling the data are ve very compelling that this kind of red or near infrared light therapy uh can be at some level neuroprotective and yes the the data suggests that uh kind of ramping up high high functioning mitochondria is a part of that uh activating neuroprotective Pathways in the retina it's actually been demonstrated in animal models and a little human data here and there but both for macular degeneration kind of uh degenerative dis but also for optic neuropathies you know like gloma retinal gangan cells the cells that carry all that visual information from the eye to the brain they're chalk full of mitochondria too and uh and so the idea that this could be a therapeutic approach I think is very compelling there are a number of studies actually I think still ongoing today really trying to figure out what's the right dose how much brightness do you need is there an optimal wavelength how many minutes does it matter when during the day you provide that light or how many minutes or hours um these are still very much open questions you know what's the dose what's the delivery um but it's it's it's it's very promising looking and there's biological premise and I'm excited to see where that goes because again that's like a that's a very accessible uh sort of therapeutic approach that could be brought to a very broad swath of of people so I'm excited about that sorry I didn't mean to interrupt and completely non-invasive um I should um probably mention a warning which is if people are going to decide that they're going to jump on this result and do red light exposure in the early part of the day no matter what color a light is if it's too bright you can damage your eye so I think this is why you're pointing the fact that we need established protocols um before people really start blasting their eyes with red light and if they are going to expose themselves to Red Light it shouldn't be uncomfortably bright do I have that correct yeah that's absolutely right you know actually uh light effect um we talked about this a little bit earlier um there's actually now data also that red light and actually interestingly studies using light at the other end of the visible spectrum violet light either of those in small daily doses can also be used to prevent progression of nearsightedness in children in school AG children and so uh I think we're really just on the cusp of really understanding the biology of how these different light therapies might be leveraged maximally to to maximize our Eye Health uh and both during development and at the other end of the spectrum uh as we age um so it's an exciting area and I think this kind of photo therapy is uh you know um a very hot topic for research right now very hot topic one has to wonder whether or not these light therapies the fact that infrared works and maybe ultraviolet works is are really just capturing some of what sunlight is naturally doing when as you mentioned before a child or perhaps an adult also spends a certain number of hours outdoors I mean maybe we're just filling in the blanks that are neglected nowadays because we're spending so much time indoors under artificial lights and in front of screens yeah yeah that's yeah very thoughtful possibility yeah I have a couple of we don't have to call them quick questions but common questions that perhaps have a brief uh explanations uh for instance I put out a request for questions in anticipation of this episode and I got a lot of people asking what are floaters in the eye and is there anything that people can do to get rid of floaters yeah our our eye when we're born is actually filled in the middle of with a a jelly it's not just fluid it's kind of a jelly there's collagen fibers and thankfully the whole jelly is largely invisible so the light can get through our eye back to the retina without being impeded as we age those different fibers and gels shrink and contract and they peel off of the back of the retina so there's just in the middle now your your your eyeball doesn't shrink because it fills in with with fluid with saltwater basically but the gel part shrinks and as it shrinks and also pulls peels off the retina uh it can pull off kind of little tiny retinal bits not important to your vision bits but just like little tissue bits and also as it congeals it kind of uh can get little concretions in the jelly and we perceive those as floaters you know little almost semi-translucent or in some cases kind of grayish blackish sometimes sometimes you get a big one if it peels off the of the optic nerve in the back of the eye as happens we call that a posterior Vitus Detachment you can actually see like a moon or a half moon floer uh in Your Vision these are very frustrating to a lot of people um and uh the good news is in almost all cases they will just go away by themselves in theory it's been played with gosh we could do like a big surgery to chew up all that jelly replace it all with salt water try to get of your floaters there's risk associated with that surgery we use it very effectively in retinal detachments or other diseases bad diabetic retinopathy bleeding inside the eye we can take out the jelly from the eye replace it with with with salt water uh but that's not um you know putting patients through the risk of that surgery just to get rid of a couple of floaters or a few floaters that probably are going to go away over the next few months I actually like to tell patients it's nothing to worry about just ignore them and actually if you stop focusing on them your brain will actually start filtering them out you'll stop noticing them if you can kind of uh not worry about them be a little intentional about ignoring them in the beginning and then they do actually go away and look some will go away these three will go away these two will appear uh eventually you'll stop having floaters most patients will stop having floaters um so we really don't like to put a patient at risk by intervening we really like to in this case just reassure them it's going to be okay just ignore them they'll eventually go away thank you for that answer twitching of the eye is something that people complain about I know when I get tired I'll get a twitch over one eye I think there's a condition is it called myena gravis where people go through a stressful period or get very fatigued and I think that's a depletion of the nerve terminal communication between the nerves that control the muscles of the eye and then people get this kind of like hooded eye look um where they have a hard time opening their eyes but barring something extreme like mytina gravis or staying up for two days working or even just being a bit sleep deprived what causes the twitching of the eyelid and is there anything people can do about that most of the time it's actually just a bad nerve ending you know uh maybe that one nerve cell you know your eyelid is fed by you know hundreds maybe it's thousands of nerve cells that are doing the muscles they're doing the feeling obviously it's the ones controlling the muscles that can lead to a twitch if one of those nerve cells kind of just starts you know maybe that one nerve cell is dying just you know whatever the aging process uh you know it happens in young people too though so you got one bad fiber that's just deciding to kind of ring off the hook that's that's that telephone is just ringing off the hook and it's just activating the muscle so you're just twitching that muscle um I've had them as well and you can have them not just in your eyelids you can have this anywhere in your body like one little spot on your leg where just the muscle right under the skin is just and typically it'll happen over the course of a couple of months uh intermittently some days more some days less maybe it correlates with when you're tired a little bit sometimes um and then it'll stop that nerve cell will either reconnect properly and stop doing that maybe it dies we don't really know but typically at lasts on that scale now there are other diseases not just myasthenia gravis you can have bleros spasm like where you have a chronic spasming of of of certain nerves causing muscles to spasm and there we we can use we can use treatments for example Botox is a treatment that uh you know people use for cosmetic reducing of wrinkles for example but you know a really good medical use of Botox is preventing that Leos spasm and patients can come in once every 3 or six months if they have a really severe spasming version of what you're describing but the regular occasional run-of-the-mill lasts a couple months nothing to worry about it does not pre- anything bad happening in your future and uh maybe let it run its course and you'll be okay great we've all heard that carrots are good for our vision which presumably stems from some peripheral understanding about the fact that vitamin A is integral to the photosynthesis pathway of converting light into electrical and chemical signals that the rest of the ion brain can use and yet I'm guessing that there probably aren't that many people walking around who are vitamin A deficient they're probably out there but not that many especially in developed countries and in addition in the last really five years but in particular in the last two years I've seen a proliferation of supplements on the market to promote Eye Health and longevity of vision I'd love your thought on this General theme of nutrition and supplements for improving Eye Health or for maintaining Eye Health and before we started recording you mentioned that Opthalmology or at least Eye Health is one area of medicine that has a bit not extensive but a bit of a longer history of exploring supplementation in rigorous randomized control trials whereas other areas of neuros science and Neural Health such as Alzheimer's Etc certainly there are brain health supplements out there but there aren't a lot of rigorous data to support them just yet so what are your thoughts on nutrition um aside from the standard thing of you know people shouldn't be ingesting too many calories such that they are obese and diabetic and therefore you know Etc indirect effects of nutrition um what are your thoughts on nutrition and supplementation for Eye Health yeah you know you're absolutely right and again in Opthalmology we actually do have quite bit of studies there's been quite a bit of attention over the years even over the decades looking at this question and I think it's worth highlighting um a couple of yeses and a couple of NOS for macular degeneration which we talked about being an exceedingly common cause of vision loss uh there have been two age related eye disease studies called AIDS age related eye disease studies arids there was arids and then arids too and those studies were large randomized Trials of using giving giving patients supplements and in arids it was vitamin c and e uh higher dose than would just come in a multivitamin zinc and copper and then also beta carotene and betacarotene is one of these what are called carotenoids it's a it's a if you look at the extended family there's maybe 600 different chemical entities of these catenoids and betacarotene is one of the that's in the direct pathway of making vitamin A and so that was the principle in the aid study and the aid study showed that patients randomized to these pills compared to controls it it did the these are antioxidants in part right in addition to feeding into that vitamin A pathway and um and the patients randomized to get that supplement mixture showed less progression of their dry macular degeneration in the moderate to severe range es if you had mild macul degeneration they didn't show a statistically significant Improvement but I will say it's my experience you know myself with patients and and seeing how the field works you know if you have mild macular degeneration even though it's not as clinically proven we're still often recommending hey if you can afford that supplement go ahead and buy that now irids Was Then followed by a second study irids 2 also with vitamin C vitamin E zinc and copper they actually tested whether a slightly lower dose of zinc would be as good as a higher dose and a lower dose was as good as a higher dose and then instead of the beta carotene they tested against the betacarotene they tried two other carotenoids that are called lutein and zantin and and they actually found head-to-head that the second the AIDS 2 formula without the beta carotene and with the ltin and xanthine uh that that formula was even better at slowing dry macular degeneration in the moderate to severe population again it's not clear how much it may help mild macular degeneration but in the uh sort of clinically defined moderate toward severe group there was a statistically sign it reduced it by about 225% the progression of your dry maage generation and you know over a couple of years 25% you may not notice but over a couple of decades you know that could really slow down the progression of your disease now it turns out that the beta katene they noted a little bit of an increased cancer risk in the patients in the arids one who had that beta keratin mostly in patients who are smokers they also noticed in the second one that if you were already not taking a multivitamin or not eating a diet that's already naturally rich in ltin or zaz xanthine that the effect of that supplement was even stronger so it was very strong clinical trial support for taking what we now use this arids 2 supplementation and I'm sure we can list the formula or put it in the links under under under your podcast uh uh that that this really does slow maculate degeneration so that's like a very strong example of a yes you should do this there's one yes brewing in the glaucoma field right now and that's high do vitamin B3 is in boy 3 it's also called in its various forms either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide uh the nicotin sounds like nicotine but this is not a substitute for smoking or vaping this is a different this is a vitamin that just has a very similar sounding name it's in the NAD synthesis pathway correct that's exactly right it's in the NAD pathway NAD is one of the oxidative stress regulators and energy Regulators of our cells so it's a very critical molec in the metabolism of our cells and there was very strong evidence in preclinical models of mice given glaucoma that manipulating this pathway and and sort of increasing this pathway could be protective in glaucoma or other optic neuropathies optic nerve degenerative diseases and so there have now been two limited but randomized controlled clinical trials one looking at glaucoma patients looking at their visual so they're actual visual performance and the other looking at the electrical signals in the eye called an electroretinogram kind of like an EEG does for your brain we can do an ERG for your retina and in both of those trials high do vitamin B3 was a found to be very safe and B was shown to actually improve at least in the short term improve retinal function measured either on visual field testing or on uh the electroretinogram now this is now entering clinical trials large kind of phase three style clinical trials actually around the world it's a very hot topic for glaucoma the fact that this NAD boosting supplementation with high dose vitamin B3 might be a great approach to helping Pro protect the nerve in in glaucoma and uh so as I say there's there's three or four large randomized phase three style clinical trials uh starting now and so over the next year or two we'll get more data um but I'll tell you like I have patients and if they're at the end of their rope and we are having a lot of trouble controlling their vision loss from glaucoma I'm already recommending in these limited cases uh hey why don't you try this it's almost certainly safe uh and it may and it may help and it may help protect your vision over time so so that's that's an area that's kind of another like kind of could be a yes early dat is pointing in the right direction you want to be careful but uh but I but I am starting to recommend it at the same time that we're actually doing the clinical trials now that said there are a lot of other things that people talk about other supplements Geno balua uh things with generic names on the internet like you know glaucoma preservation uh yeah that sort of thing makes my uh gives me hives you know yeah and and these are areas where there might be scientific premise like a plausible explanation for how this should help but not good data that it actually helps thankfully in most cases these things are safe uh but I just worry about patients hitching their wagon to something that's not going to help them getting their hopes up uh worst case scenario not taking their actually proven prescribed treatments and instead using an alternative therapy that doesn't have data to support it and so I think there there's a lot of you know um uh uh you know either un unfounded unsupported uh you know information it travels around chat rooms travels around the internet one person tells the next person you know there's inappropriate advertising for some of these uh and there you know I really don't want patients to be hurt not necessarily hurt by taking something that's not helping but but maybe hurt by feeling like ah I don't have to go to the doctor I'm taking this supplement and that would be obviously a really bad potential outcome for a patient yeah I completely agree uh supplements are just as the name suggests a supplement to an already hopefully healthy lifestyle and use of medication where it's prescribed and uh I've often said on the podcast that um Sometimes the best dose of a supplement is zero milligrams um um so I do appreciate you touching on those themes because um supplementation is something that comes up from time to time on the podcast and I know that I've certainly have seen a number of these different ey andv Vision support supplements we aren't affiliated with any of them um I don't personally take any of them but these clinical trials sound promising so I'm going to um keep an ear to the ground uh for them as a final question and hopefully a topic that we can cover in more detail in a subsequent episode of the podcast because I absolutely want to have you back to discuss this in more detail I'd like to just get your thoughts on the fact that the neural retina is in fact neural and it's part of the brain and we are hearing an increasing amount of positive chatter about the use of Imaging the eye and the retina directly as a way to detect other forms of neurod degeneration for those that are listening or for watching um you know I'm putting my hands up in a kind of C shape back of your eye is lined with these with this three cell layer thick thing that is the neural retina which are really pieces of brain that connect to the rest of the brain and because it resides in the eyes and outside the cranial Vault people like you skilled clinicians with the appropriate tools can look into the eye and see the brain directly without having to cut through the skull and my understanding is that more and more opthalmologists are seeing cases where degeneration of the retina is correlated with degeneration of structures deeper in the brain making Imaging of the neural retina perhaps one of the best diagnostic tools for predicting and tracking the progression of Alzheimer's and other forms of neurod degeneration do I have that right yeah absolutely actually this is a super exciting area you know we we have this long-standing saying in Opthalmology that the ey is a window to the brain the eyes is a window to the soul of course is a longstanding saying right and and it turns out that you know in Alzheimer's disease as an example you know we really talk a lot about the degeneration of Basil forbrain colonic neurons that are leading to the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease but it turns out that there is also some degeneration throughout other areas of the brain including the retina and since we have such a relatively easy time Imaging the retina you can go into your doctor's office and get a quick little uh sort of laser scan of the retina a picture of the retina compared to like going through a full MRI process for your brain uh and we can detect the degeneration of the retina optic nerve associated with Alzheimer's disease it looks like the same thing is happening in Perkins disease and Ms now one of the issues is that in a lot of these degenerative diseases we're we're able to detect the difference in the retina but we're not necessarily able to say hey if we see this in the retina it's multiple sclerosis but if we see that in the retina it's Alzheimer's disease so there may not be there may be good sensitivity to detecting the disease and to following whether your diseas is your brain disease is getting worse but there may not be very good specificity differentiating the different diseases and I say that with a very big asterisk at the end of that sentence because there's actually amazingly cool new data one of our colleagues who you know Al dubra has helped revolutionize a new way of iming the retina that's giving us now cellular resolution and even subcellular resolution seeing things smaller than the sizes of cells inside our retina and recently in one of his projects he's teamed up with another one of our faculty Heather Moss she's a neuro opthalmologist so she really specializes clinically in the eye brain connection and her research focuses on that and together they made actually an amazing recent discovery of very special ized unusual novel structures that they can detect in the retina of patients with multiple sclerosis and whether these kinds of discoveries or other similar kinds of discoveries are going to lead to kind of a a whole new generation of biomarkers which are ways of measuring disease diagnosing who has the disease figuring out who's getting worse from the disease figuring out who's responding to therapies that we're trying to use to treat the diseases this is a very exciting area and this really touches on what we're all hoping is the future of of eye care as well as the rest of medicine and that's that's Precision medicine but also what we call Precision Health we really want to not just figure out what drug treatment to give this patient versus that treatment but we really want to figure out who's at risk of even getting some of these diseases and gosh we could intervene now and prevent them from ever getting in trouble in the future fantastic can't wait to hear more about those developments and listen I want to say on behalf of the listeners and myself just thank you ever so much for the discussion today I don't think I can ever recall a conversation that's included so much basic science and clinical science and also so many actionable recommendations both dos and don'ts as it relates to something so critical as Eye Health I also was just reflecting for a moment about the fact that I think you and I met 20 years ago when you were a graduate student by the way folks um Jeff is uh sort of the Kobe Bryant of sort although unfortunately still with us in the sense that he went directly from his MD and PhD skipped his postdoc didn't require one directly to being a faculty uh member most people don't do that they do a five-year postto in between wait and then I believe he's going to tell me all the places I'm wrong and I should just come clean that um Jeff is my chairi of department at um Stanford School of Medicine Department of Opthalmology so for me I I see this as a particularly warming but also um at once predictable but pure pleasure of an experience to get to learn so much from you because I don't think we've had this long to sit down and talk science in a very long time so thank you for doing that for my own sake thank you for teaching us so much about how to take care of our Eye Health and now you can tell me where my um history is wrong maybe my hippocampus is degenerating no it's been a pleasure over the years I have nothing but the warmest memories of of you as a postto and me as a graduate student getting to be you know nerds in the laboratory uh years ago 20 years ago uh at Stanford in the lab of Ben Baris and uh and very warm wonderful feelings about you know learning science and how to do science and making real advances even at that time and then the fact that we've had the chance to cross paths in San Diego again at Stanford collaborate on important projects having to do with you know developing new ways of measuring diseases developing new ways of treating diseases the idea that we're going to actually bring forward some of the advances uh that our lab that your lab that other people's Labs have been making in neuroprotection in diseases like glaucoma and Mac degeneration in regeneration of the optic nerve of the retina uh we are real close on a lot of those this is a major topic of really The Cutting Edge research that we're really trying to keep pushing forward because we know it's so important to patients you know I I often joke you know my mother had a uh a sign outside the bathroom and it said remember how long a minute is depends on what side of the door you're on and I really appreciate that like as fast as we're trying to go with our research and moving that into clinical research which I think we're doing very effectively in the department really working on Vision restoration research in the department I appreciate that as fast as we think we're going it's not fast enough for so many patients who are suffering from these diseases so thanks very much for having me on it's been a real pleasure uh reconnecting over these many important tops X I really appreciate the chance to talk with you well delighted to do it and looking forward to doing it again you're an amazing colleague friend clinician and now public health educator thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion all about I and vision health with Dr Jeffrey Goldberg I

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an Ask Me Anything episode, or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feeds-- YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere. We also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere, research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny Foundation has agreed to match that amount, so now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe, or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one-time payment, and again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium. For those of you that are already subscribers to the Premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the Premium subscription feed. And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you. So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about the pros and cons of daily caffeine consumption. The question reads, what is your opinion on the net benefit of daily caffeine consumption? And how can somebody determine if daily caffeine consumption is right for them? Well, first of all, I did an entire episode about caffeine. You can find that by going to hubermanlab.com. At that website, you can put in caffeine into the search function, and you'll find links to that episode in all the formats-- YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. And it's timestamped, of course. You can navigate to the particular topics most of interest to you. However, for sake of this discussion, I can summarize a few of the key points. The most important thing to understand is that for most adults-- so that is people about age 18 to 20 and older-- daily caffeine consumption is not going to be a problem provided it does not induce anxiety, and certainly provided that it not induce anxiety or panic attacks, and provided that it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep. This is why I always recommend that if you are going to consume caffeine in any form, coffee, tea, soda, or otherwise, that you try not to ingest caffeine within the eight and ideally within the 10 or even 12 hours prior to bedtime. That's because the half life of caffeine is such that even if you are able to, for instance, have a cup of coffee around 3:00 PM or 4:00 PM and then fall asleep around midnight, the architecture of the sleep that you get is going to be disrupted. For instance, it is very important that you get sufficient amounts of both slow wave deep sleep as well as rapid eye movement sleep each night. And if you consume caffeine too close to bedtime-- and here, I'm defining to close as anywhere from 8 to 12 hours before going to sleep-- chances are you're not going to get as much rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep that you would otherwise. And it is the amount of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep that, together, lead to whether or not you feel you had a good night's sleep in terms of your next day alertness and cognitive abilities. Now, again, some people may find that they can drink caffeine in the late afternoon, maybe even at night, and still fall asleep. But I promise you, even if you're in that category, you will sleep far better, meaning the architecture of your sleep will be better, and you will feel far more rested the next day if you abstain from caffeine within the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime. And I should also say that none of us are perfect, myself included. I will sometimes have a cup of coffee in the late afternoon, and sometimes that will cause me to stay up a little bit later. Sometimes it won't. I don't think you want to obsess or worry too much about having some caffeine every once in a while in the late afternoon if you are still able to fall asleep, but don't make it a regular habit. Now, as far as we know, there is no drawback to consuming caffeine on a daily basis, again, provided it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep and provided that does not induce anxiety. In fact, most of the world consumes caffeine every single day. The current estimates are that 90%-- that's right, 9-0, 90%-- of adults throughout the world consume a caffeinated beverage every single day. That's a staggeringly high number, making caffeine the most popular drug on the planet. In fact, because of the way that caffeine works-- and just to remind you how it works-- it effectively blocks adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in your brain and body more and more according to how long you've been awake. It makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor, and then when it is dislodged from that receptor, whatever adenosine has built up and is around can then bind to the adenosine receptor. It makes you feel very sleepy. That's the caffeine crash. So if 90% of the adult population of the planet Earth is consuming caffeine every day, that means 90% of the adult population of planet Earth is blocking their adenosine receptors for some portion of their daily life, and then their adenosine is binding to the vacant receptor once the caffeine has dislodged. And why are 90% of adult humans consuming caffeine every day? Well, to feel more energized, more focused, to have more both cognitive energy and physical energy. Now, of course, most people are not walking around thinking, oh, caffeine gives me more energy more focus, et cetera. Most people are consuming caffeine every single day and are consuming caffeine every single day in order to feel, quote, unquote, normal, to be at their baseline level of cognitive ability, and physical energy, and so on. In fact, if you look at the data on caffeine consumption, what you'll find is that caffeine actually is a cognitive enhancer. It can improve learning and memory. It can increase physical energy. It can increase mental and physical stamina. But a feature of those studies that's not often discussed but that was, however, discussed in the full episode on caffeine is that studies of caffeine typically are done by taking chronic caffeine users and then having them abstain from caffeine for some period of time, usually four days to two weeks, in which time they undergo caffeine withdrawal. They do not feel well. They get foggy headed. They have less energy. There's some malaise, sometimes even some mild depression. And then what they do is they have people take caffeine, and take a cognitive exam, or do some physical activity and compare their performance to what it was when they were in the withdrawal state. Another typical form of study on caffeine is to take people who are naive to caffeine or who never take caffeine, and then have them ingest caffeine, and then measure their cognitive and/or physical performance. And in both cases, you see improvements. What I'm saying here is that daily caffeine consumption is not going to lead to improvements in cognitive ability or improvements in physical ability above one's baseline unless you either abstain from caffeine for some period of time, typically four days to two weeks prior, or you are not somebody who typically ingests caffeine. In other words, 90% of the world's population is drinking caffeine on a daily basis to be at their normal level of mental and physical functioning. So the question was, is there a net benefit to daily caffeine consumption? And here I can reliably say, provided you don't suffer from anxiety attacks or lack of sleep from the caffeine consumption, provided that you're mindful of not ingesting caffeine too late in the day, there doesn't seem to be any big drawback to drinking caffeine on a daily basis. However, there doesn't seem to be any great benefit, at least in terms of direct effects on cognitive or physical ability. So I realize this is a little bit of a convoluted answer, but we have to be honest with one another here. Caffeine is a performance-enhancing drug, but only when compared to the noncaffeinated state. And 90% of the adult population of the world is caffeinated. So adding more caffeine above what you would normally consume is certainly not going to allow you to think better and perform better physically. Here's a useful way to think about caffeine. Most people can pretty well tolerate doses of caffeine, anywhere from 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams. It depends on body weight and depends on your tolerance, tolerance, of course, based on how familiar you are with the effects of caffeine and how regularly you consume it. A typical cup of coffee, which, by the way, does not exist. Depending on the vendor, depending on how much water-to-coffee ratio one uses, depending on whether or not it's French press or it's pour over, the type of coffee, et cetera, all of that is going to determine the total amount of caffeine in that coffee. But we can set some outer bounds on the total amount of caffeine that likely exists in a cup of coffee, and it's probably somewhere between 100 milligrams-- that would be on the weaker side for a six or eight ounce cup of coffee-- out to about 300 milligrams for the equivalent six to eight ounces of coffee. But if you were to brew your coffee very, very strong or, like me, occasionally throw a shot of espresso in there, too, you could get that number up to 400 or 500 milligrams of caffeine. I personally tolerate caffeine pretty well. I've been drinking caffeine since I was a teenager, mostly in the form of brewed unflavored yerba mate tea. It's important to stay away from the smoked varieties of yerba mate if you're going to get your caffeine from your yerba mate. The smoked varieties can be carcinogenic. The nonsmoked varieties don't seem to have that property. But there's a lot of caffeine in yerba mate, so I'll drink yerba mate and have for many, many years. Or I'll drink black coffee, or espresso, or espresso americano, things of that sort. That's my preferred source of caffeine. Most people are drinking coffee to get their caffeine and, I would say that, if you are going to drink your caffeine, drink it in the early part of the day, as I mentioned earlier. I am a big proponent of delaying your first caffeine intake until at least 90 minutes after waking in order to avoid the afternoon crash. I've talked a lot about this on the podcast. There are a lot of clips on the internet explaining the rationale behind that. And if you do experience an afternoon crash in energy, I do recommend delaying your morning caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking. Now, for people that want to get more of a true cognitive-enhancing and performance-enhancing effect from caffeine, again, you're going to have to abstain from caffeine for about four days. For regular caffeine drinkers, that's going to be difficult. That is going to lead to headaches. That's going to lead to brain fog. That's going to lead to feelings of malaise. In fact, the last time I took four days off or even a week off from caffeine consumption was when I was sick. I don't get sick very often, but when I am sick, I generally abstain from caffeine. And sometimes I wonder whether or not the malaise I feel from whatever viral or bacterial thing I might be dealing with when I'm sick is, in part, the malaise of caffeine withdrawal. I certainly notice I feel much better when I return to drinking caffeine, but that tends to coincide with feeling relief from whatever sinus symptoms and other symptoms I might have been experiencing from the illness. So it's not a good experiment. I can't tease apart those variables. So the short answer is, for most adults, there does not seem to be any major downside to consuming caffeine. And there have been scattered reports here and there in humans, showing that ingesting caffeine can increase dopamine receptors, which will effectively allow you to get more out of the dopamine that you produce. This is why caffeine has a mood elevating as well as energy-elevating effect. I should point out that some people just cannot tolerate caffeine. It makes them too jittery, too anxious. They start sweating. They get heart palpitations. It's very hard for these people to build up a tolerance to caffeine that allows them to enjoy it. These are the people that can even feel a fluttering of the heart and a lot of energy left from decaf coffee, something that, to me, is just a foreign. Concept but some people are just that sensitive to caffeine that even the small amounts of caffeine in chocolate or decaf coffee make them feel too alert. And they should abstain from caffeine. I don't think they are, in any way, harming their health by abstaining from caffeine. Then there's the issue of children, and adolescents, and teenagers, and young adults ingesting caffeine. And I covered some of this in the episode about caffeine, but there's been a lot of debate as to whether or not caffeine can cause osteoporosis, whether or not it can leach calcium out of the bones, whether or not can stunt growth. Frankly, there's not a lot of evidence for those sorts of claims, and yet the developing brain is a very tender and malleable environment. And somebody who started off his career as a developmental neurobiologist, studying developmental brain plasticity and wiring, it does sort of make me cringe to think about children younger than the age of, say, 14 ingesting large amounts of caffeine in any form-- soda, coffee, tea, et cetera. Despite the fact that there's very little evidence that it can stunt their growth, I don't personally like the idea of the young brain being bathed in an adenosine receptor antagonist, which is effectively what caffeine is. As much as possible, one wants the developing brain to develop in a milieu of unencumbered, nonchemically encumbered interactions between neurotransmitters and their receptors, unless, of course, there's a clinical need for a prescription drug, or a supplement, or some modification of a nutritional program specifically to up or down regulate the dopamine system or up or down regulate the serotonin system. But those are the sorts of decisions that really should be made in close oversight and recommendations by a psychiatrist. So the short answer around daily caffeine consumption in young people, meaning 14 and younger, is avoid it if you can. Have your children avoid caffeine if they can. The occasional bit of caffeine is probably not going to be a problem. The amount of caffeine in small amounts of chocolate, probably not going to be a problem. But caffeine in the form of energy drinks, sodas, coffee, tea for children younger than 14 just seems like a bad idea from everything we understand about brain wiring and the trajectories of brains that develop with a lot of chemical adjustment from other sources, like caffeine. Now, for kids age 15 to, say, 18 or 20, a lot of brain wiring is still occurring, but a lot of it has been completed. So probably not as risky to consume caffeine every once in a while or maybe even on a daily basis. But there are two-- I think there are great advantages to limiting the amount of caffeine that one ingests. And of course, in the adolescent and teen years, nowadays a lot of kids are consuming energy drinks and soda. And some of those energy drinks and so does contain a lot of caffeine, anywhere from 200 to 800 milligrams of caffeine. And nowadays, more sodas and energy drinks contain other things like amino acid precursors to neuromodulators, like dopamine. So for instance, a lot of energy drinks now contain L-tyrosine, which is a precursor to dopamine. A lot of them will contain L-theanine. I've talked about L-theanine as a supplement that can promote more restful sleep if taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep. The reason why a lot of energy drinks, and sodas, and, frankly, now coffee brands are including theanine in the coffee, or energy drink, or soda is because it tends to have a mild anxiety-reducing effect. And it reduces the jitters that caffeine creates. And so that's actually a trick that these companies are using in order to get people to ingest more caffeine because, by including the theanine, it's preventing the kid or adult from feeling too jittery. And therefore, they can continue to consume that drink without feeling like they're overstimulated. So if I were to take the parental neuroscientist adult voice here, I would say avoid caffeine intake as much as you can until you're about 18 years old. But I'm realistic. I realize that adolescents and teens age, say, 14, or 15, out to 18, and older are going to be consuming caffeine in the form of energy drinks and sodas. But reducing the total amount of caffeine that one is ingesting in those years, it just seems really advantageous, again, m all the same reasons I mentioned earlier. You don't want the young brain bathing in a bunch of exogenous, meaning externally introduced neurochemicals or in things like theanine or L-tyrosine. If you're going to indulge in caffeine, or in energy drinks, or theanine, or L-tyrosine, for that matter, that's the sort of thing that probably is best left for people 18 and older. And even there, if one finds that caffeine is for them, as do I, I think always best to try and get your caffeine from a clean source, a clean source meaning something that contains just coffee or just tea. Again, this isn't a knock on energy drink specifically, but you really have to make sure that whatever energy drink you're going to consume, you know what's in it. You recognize what the different ingredients do. And you recognize the potential of ingesting those ingredients chronically over and over again. And I've talked to a little bit about this on previous podcasts, and I'll get into this. Again, maybe we'll do an entire episode about energy drinks because they are so commonly consumed nowadays. Now, getting back to the original question about daily caffeine consumption, this person goes on to say that, for them-- OK, this is their personal experience-- after a few weeks of consumption of daily caffeine, the negatives start to outweigh the positive ones. They're getting poor-quality sleep, lack of appetite, anxiety, et cetera. And when they don't consume caffeine, they find it a lot easier to be mindful, and their meditation practice is much better. But they're lethargic and less motivated. So what they're describing are all the classic symptoms of caffeine overuse, probably not abuse in this case, although caffeine can be truly abused, people taking caffeine pills, et cetera in large quantities. We're not talking about that. But this person is describing the classic pattern of overuse of caffeine and the classic pattern of withdrawal from caffeine when they stop taking it. So what should somebody like this do? And I think that's an important question to answer because I think a lot of people fall into this category. They drink caffeine every day. They're no longer getting the performance-enhancing effect of caffeine, so they're taking it just to be normal or feel like they can focus normally and have normal amounts of energy. But then if they try and come off, they feel worse. There are a couple of ways to do this. You can taper your caffeine intake off over the course of four to seven days. But most people don't have the discipline or don't want to spend the time doing that. But if you want to, the way you would do that is you would cut it by about 10% or 15% per day. You could do that by volume, or you could do that by concentration of coffee, that sort of thing. A simpler way to go about all this that still will allow you to get some of the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine and yet experience far less withdrawal would be two things. First of all, just halve your amount of caffeine intake for two or three days. So again, that could be by volume, or it could be by concentration, probably easiest to do by volume. And so instead of drinking an eight ounce coffee in the morning, maybe you do four ounces of regular coffee, four ounces of decaf, or you just have the four ounces of coffee. You do that for three or four days, and then you take perhaps one full day off from caffeine, maybe another full day off. You're going to feel a lot less bad on those two days, having cut your caffeine intake in half in the previous four days then you would if you just went cold turkey. And then you go back to ingesting caffeine, but you go back to ingesting caffeine at that 50% dose or what used to represent that 50% dose of caffeine for you. And you just continue that way on a daily basis, and then every once in a while, when you want the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you go back to what was your original dose, which is now double what you're taking on a daily basis. So what we're really talking about here is not going cold turkey. We're not talking about quitting caffeine indefinitely. What we're talking about is cutting the amount of caffeine that you drink in half for about four days, plus or minus a day, and then taking two days off from caffeine completely. And then going back on that half dose of caffeine indefinitely. That's your new baseline of caffeine intake. And then every once in a while, if you need a bit more of a lift, you ingest twice as much caffeine or a coffee that's twice as concentrated. We should acknowledge that most people aren't going to be really precise about the amount of ounces and the amount of caffeine. Nonetheless, it's pretty straightforward to know that you're reducing your caffeine intake. Certainly, it's clear to know if you're ingesting no caffeine for a couple of days. And it's pretty clear when you're doubling the amount of caffeine. But you don't have to worry so much that you're exactly doubling the amount of caffeine. You can drink one and a half times as much as you happen to drink on the day before, or you could drink three times as much. You would definitely feel it if you drink three times as much. One very important thing to recognize is that, on any day where you really spike your caffeine intake above baseline, no matter where that baseline is when you start-- it could be 0. It could be 400 milligrams. It could be 200 milligrams. When you double that intake, you will get a big boost of energy, and the next day, you're going to feel the crash from that. You're going to feel more lethargic. You're going to feel not so good. This has to do with dopamine receptor modulation. This has to do with adenosine receptor modulation. The important thing to do is not continue to consume that elevated level of caffeine, which is what most people do, and then they set a new hire baseline just to feel normal. The key thing is to just manage to get through that crash day, manage to get through that one day where you feel a little less good or maybe even down a bit. Get outside a bit. Get some more sunshine. We know that spikes your cortisol in a good way. It can increase the catecholamines, dopamine, et cetera. Get a little bit more sunlight. Get a little bit more movement. Get outside. Do something to offset those feelings of malaise, and then get right back to your original goal level of caffeine each day. There's no use in getting so quantitative that you make your life miserable, you're measuring things out like a laboratory chemist. If you're that type and you want to do that, be my guest. But unless you're taking caffeine in pill form, it's very, very hard to get extremely exact about the amounts of caffeine that you're ingesting. So it is OK to eyeball it, but understand the contour of how caffeine works and what the caffeine performance-enhancing effect comes from. It comes from a caffeine intake above baseline. Understand that any time you go above baseline with your caffeine intake, there's the potential of some anxiety. Understand that there's going to be a slight withdrawal effect that lasts about 24 to 48 hours. Battle through that short period, and you'll be right back where you started and where you need to be so that you can enjoy caffeine on a daily basis and derive the benefits because there are many benefits to drinking caffeine and avoiding some of the potential hazards. And again, if you're a young person, I recommend delaying that caffeine intake maybe, I don't know, 10 years. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length-- we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast-- and to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance, and those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Tim Ferris Tim Ferris is an author a podcaster an investor and is known for having a near Supernatural ability to predict the future which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different Endeavors for instance he is a five-time number one New York Times bestselling author but perhaps equally or more important to that he's also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write the entire process of writing and marketing a book his books the 4-Hour chef and the 4-Hour Body and the 4-Hour Work Week not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills but he teaches you those skills as well this is really what sets Tim apart he is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher and today you learn why that is and in a characteristic Tim Ferris way he explains the process in a way that you can apply it he lists out for instance the specific questions that you should ask When approaching any Endeavor in order to get the information that you want and to make the process of learning and getting better at something and achieving great success in something that much more likely that ability that Tim has to identify the specific questions that one needs to ask and answer answer and the specific action steps to take in order to achieve success is really what I believe sets Tim apart from everyone else on the Internet or on the bookshelf that's giving advice as to how to become good at something Tim Ferris is also dedicated to various philanthropic efforts the most recent of which is the donation of several millions of his own dollars to research on psychedelics for the treatment of otherwise intractable psychiatric challenges such as major depression suicidal depression eating disorders and addiction and he's also brought together other philanthropists which has really galvanized the whole field of psychedelic research for the treatment of mental health transforming it from what was recently kind of a fringe area of science to a main stay that's actually funded not only by philanthropy but by the National Institutes of Health so he's really transformed this entire scientific field into one that now is transforming the laws around psychedelics and is providing mental health treatment for people that would otherwise suffer today's discussion was a particularly meaningful one because not only is Tim a Pioneer in the world of podcasting but it also marked the 9-year anniversary of his podcast the Tim ferah show now as I mentioned earlier Tim is known for being able to see around corners or predict the future he really does seem to be about five if not 10 years ahead of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization in particular domains of life and so we were very fortunate that during today's discussion he shares with us his current creative Endeavors and how he's thinking about and approaching those and he also breaks down for us the process of how to think about and prioritize one's schedule not just on the order of the day not just on the order of the week but really thinking about one's life as a journey and how to organize and go about that Journey so today's discussion will provide with you tremendous insight into who Tim Ferris is and how that incredible mind of his Works in order to do all the amazing things that he's done and of course he teaches you how to do it he will tell you the exact questions that you should ask and that you should answer and how to step back and think about those questions and then prioritize so that you can decide how to best invest your time I'm sure many of you are familiar with the Tim ferah show however if you're not already subscribing to the Tim ferah show I highly recommend you do I still go back and listen to early episodes of the timf far show and I'm a weekly listener to the new episodes we provide a link to the Tim Fair show in the show note captions also in the show note captions you'll find links to Tim's many New York Times best-selling books and a link to his excellent weekly blog before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've talked before on this podcast about the key importance of striving to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight now when one strives to do that it's also important to maximize the quality protein to calorie ratio in other words you don't want to consume a lot of extra calories in order to get your quality protein Maui venison in having an extremely high quality protein and nutrient to calorie ratio allows you to do that very easily and in addition to that Maui Nei venison is delicious I particular like their bone broth which has an unmatched 25 gram of protein per 100 calories I also love their ground venison and their venison steaks all of them are absolutely delicious if you'd like to try Maui neui venison go to mauii Venison docomo and get 20% off your first order again that's Maui venison docomond to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that is the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium but nothing you don't which means no sugar it's critical that we get electrolytes because every cell of our body but in particular our nerve cells our neurons rely on electrolytes in order to function properly with element it's very easy to ingest the correct ratios of electrolytes they come in these little packets they're really delicious you mix them up with anywhere from 8 to 16 to 32 ounces of fluid I like mine pretty concentrated so I'll drink a 16 o glass of water with element in it when I first wake up I'll also consume another one of those maybe 32 ounces with one packet when I exercise and maybe another one if I happen to sweat a lot during exercise or if I was in the sauna and sweating lot if it's a very hot day Etc if you'd like to try element go to drink element that's lnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lnt.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities impact your blood glucose levels or blood sugar levels as they sometimes referred to with levels you can see how the specific foods you eat when you eat and exercise as well as any other activities impact your blood glucose and how those affect things like your energy level or your quality of sleep or your level of clarity and focus for mental work or your physical output for physical Endeavors I first started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods and activities impact my blood glucose levels and it's really impacted my entire schedule in fact I've shuffled a number of things around such that now I have more stable energy throughout the day yes I eliminated one or two Foods fortunately they weren't my favorite foods I've also added some new foods to my nutrition program that have allowed my blood sugar levels to remain much more steady throughout the day and to achieve better sleep at night levels even provides a simple score after any meal you eat so you can see how different foods affect you and develop a personalized nutrition program that's exactly right for you and that's really what levels is about it's really about tailoring things to your specific needs so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself go to levels. lhuin right now they're offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. linkhub and now for my discussion with Tim Ferris Tim Ferris I am nothing short of thrilled to have you here I've been reading your books reading your blogs listening to your podcast for a very long time and in preparing for today I was thinking you know who does Tim remind me of because I knew you reminded me of somebody but I didn't know who and then I realized it you remind me of the neurobiologist Ramon kahal you don't look anything like him he doesn't look anything like you uh he was a brilliant scientist he won the Nobel Prize in 1906 for essentially describing the structure of the nervous system he was the first along with another guy to Define synapses like it's fundamental connection the nervous system but the reason that you remind me of kahal is that it's a well-known or not so secret secret in Neuroscience that if you want to pick a really excellent project to work on you simply go and look at what kahal talked about or hypothesized and then you work on that you know he had this almost um super natural ability to look at fixed stained tissue of the nervous system much of it is incredibly beautiful by the way and think about how it worked when it was alive and he's considered the greatest neurobiologist of all time without question and it's really this feature of being able to like see around corners or into the future that establishes that link for me it's it's absolute truth that if you look back to what you were doing 10 years ago 15 years ago the kinds of things you were doing the kinds of questions you were asking that translates to much of what people like myself and people in the fitness space Tech space investor space mindfulness space psychedelic space all these different Arenas what they're doing now so um it's not hyperbole to say that you are the remon Cal of all those different spaces and podcasting of course is one of those so I owe you a great debt of gratitude and many others do as well so my first question for you is what was your mindset around the time that you wrote 4our Body 4our Work week but in particular 4-Hour Body because the protocols in that book are so very useful they were at the time it was published they still are now and so many of the things like ice baths the discussion around Brown fat thermogenesis um resistance training in its uh you know kind of basic form of just providing enough Progressive overload to get an adaptation not excessively long workouts weight loss slow carb diet um and on and on and on what were you thinking at that time like what if you can think back to then like what what were you foraging for what were you thinking about when you woke up in the morning think oh I'm going to go find all this stuff that at the time was really esoteric because it is all played out very well um what I'm basically saying is if you want to know what's going to be happening hot and useful in 5 years 10 years and onwards just look at what Tim's doing at any moment so there it is well thank you for the very generous comparison and intro I'm thrilled to be here so thanks for having me and the 4 our body represented an opportunity for me to do a few things the first was to diversify my identity from outside of the realm of the say business category so it was a deliberate move since the success of the first book book bought me permission to do something else that Publishers would still want to gamble on I wanted to see if I could maybe like a Michael Lewis take my audience with me to other topics so that was a lateral move that was very deliberate from a a career optionality standpoint and then I was doing I think what I've done for a very long time and what I enjoy doing which is looking at the most prevalent beliefs and maybe dogmatic assumptions in a given field could be anything if anyone says always never should I pay attention and take note of that they may very well be right but if anything is said in absolutes I like to stress test and in the case of say physical performance or physical manipulation tracking 2008 2009 was a very interesting time because a number of different Technologies were coming online meaning being adopted by small groups you had the very early stages of say accelerometers as variables you had a number of different Innovations and means of tracking that had never been available before you had for instance and this took a bit of fiing on my side it wasn't immediately on the road map for the 4our body but continuous glucose monitors at the time that was I want to say exclusively limited to type 1 diabetics or maybe type two diabetics but largely type 1 diabetics and what captured my interest and I can't recall how I came across it but it was probably through the very earliest iterations of what later became the Quantified Self movement and I remember attending the very first gathering at Kevin Kelly's house in Pacifica California this is this was around 2009 12 people 13 people to discuss quantifying Health but the the example of a professional race car driver I can't remember the the form factor whether it was F1 or Nascar or other who who was using this continual glucose monitor for paying attention to glucose levels while driving and I thought to myself would that not be useful for healthy normals would that not have other applications if this if this is being used by high performer in this type of context might it have other types of applications which then led me to use the very early versions of Dexcom which were really painful to implant no longer the case of course that's changed a lot and I wanted to see how I might be able to find a handful of different categories of things there's the new like the genuinely new like CGM at that point was genuinely new the very old that might have some room for scientific investigation and I would say when I say scientific I don't necessarily mean randomized control trials at a university I do think as an N of one if you think about study design and you can even blind you could even Placebo control and I knew people in the small subculture of Quantified Self who did this you can I think approach things in a methodical way where you can make a lot of progress in trying to determine causality or lack thereof looking at very old things looking at orphaned things so for instance there are many examples in the world of doping where you have say Bal back in the day where famously Barry Bonds and others purportedly use things like the cream and the clear and these were based on anabolics that were sourced from Soviet literature or older literature from the 50s and 60s that might not be on the radar of say the anti-doping uh groups that would administer the testing so all of these different buckets were of interest to me and I begin where I usually do which is interviewing folks so I would interview one or two people in a given field and I might ask them any number of questions so one is what are the Nerds doing on the weekends or at night this is also really good for investing it's like all right what are the really technical nerds doing at night or on the weekends after they've put in a really long work day or work week let's take a really close look at that another one is and I'll I'll create a flow for this but what are rich people doing now that everyone or tens or hundreds of millions of people might be doing 10 years from now and an example of that would be let's just say full-time assistant virtual assistant AI right so we've seen the needs and wants being addressed by different technology but it's an iteration of the same thing on some level in the case of say using chat GPT tied into zapier for various functions and then where are people cobbling together awkward Solutions so where are people piecing together awkward Solutions and is there room for some type of innovation there these are a few of the questions that I would not only ask myself but ask experts in different areas so if I end up spending time say this was a few years prior to writing the 4-Hour Body I spent time at Nasa as and was interacting with a number of scientists some people who were working on all sorts of biological tests and at genomics and had a very Frank discussion about where they thought if they had to push right so I'll ask questions like push a little bit into the realm of Science Fiction and speculation because I'm sure you can't support any type of projection like that with the literature with scientific literature but what do you think some of the risks are of say publishing your genome because at the time a number of high-profile folks had just made their full genomes available they're like well I think in the near future it' be possible to reconstruct someone's face based on their genetic data and they like high degree of confidence like zero 100% how confident yeah 80 90% I'm like okay I should pay attention to that because if you're making your data available let's just say and it's anonymized per se you still might be identifiable it's like okay that raises some interesting questions like okay well then how might you get around that how might you put in safeguards so that you are the one and only keeper of your data so to speak uh brought up all sorts of targeted Weaponry uh bi sort of bioweapons possibilities that I was interested in and then I would ask that person who's clearly like willing to step outside of the box of whatever he's working on dayto day who are two of your close friends or two thinkers you really pay a lot of attention to are kind of at the bleeding edge of something and unorthodox and then I would just continue to have these conversations over and over again and the the the the the dream of development that I paid a lot of attention to is something along the lines of the following so the the the very Beginnings are usually in some type of extreme case and I think the extremes and this goes for product design as well but the extremes inform the mean but not vice versa so you can actually learn a lot by studying the edge cases so race horses for instance uh you'll often see things start with say race horses uh or people with wasting diseases for instance or any type of chronic or terminal illness who are willing to try some more experimental interventions then let's just take one step further bodybuilding see a lot of interesting behavior in bodybuilding and high level athletes then billionaires then rich people then the rest of us right so my assumption is and was for the for our body that along the lines of William Gibson's quote you know the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed so I'm never predicting the future I'm just finding the seeds that are germinating that I think are going to bloom and end up spreading really really widely uh so that's that's that's generally where I start and I assume the practitioners are going to be ahead of the papers so studying say the coaches whose jobs are on the line who are getting paid based on Athlete Performance and assuming that a lot of that will eventually if it holds up make its way into say the peer-reviewed exercise science papers but it's going to have a lag time of three to five years at least at least at least takes a long time yeah science is often very slow to catch up yeah um you mentioned many things I have questions about um you mentioned paying attention to the new the very old or the orphaned um so interesting and I just thought I'd uh tell you that when you sit down with a graduate student or a postdoc and they're trying to come up with a project rarely do you say you know like what do you want to work on and they fire back like really interesting question sometimes they do but that's the rare person more often than not you'll send them to the literature and they'll come back with like okay there's this new technique that we can use to answer a set of questions better than ever before or there's a very old Theory I want to revisit or there's this theory that no one pays attention to in fact we had one guest on here ODed Ravi who is studying it essentially um inheritance of traits transgenerational inheritance of traits it's a little bit although different from Lamar uh uh Evolution but it's a lot like that um in some ways and you know these orphan theories that everyone assumed were wrong and there is a basis for them so I think there's Real Genius in that U analysis um it also struck me as you were um listing off some of your process Circa the the writing of the 4-Hour Body that I and many other people are are probably curious about what the operations around all that looked like so are you or were you at the time like waking up in the morning going okay I'm going to take a walk and think about the new the old and the orphaned or um I'm GNA take a walk or sit in a chair and think about like what are the Nerds doing right now what are rich people doing right now cobbling together awkward Solutions was was that exploration a structured practice for you or is this just something that um was the consequence of being Tim Ferris waking up in the morning and just like leaning into that because i' I've experienced both right you know but I think a lot of us are uh Curious I mean that there's a lot of Mystique around you um my best to dispell it whether whether you like it or not um it it it's there and um and we're not trying to to pry but pry away is the is the establishment of structure for you something that's the consequence of structure in the first place it's like okay now it's time to think or do you just allow things to geyser up to the surface I do both and I would say that in the case of the 4-Hour Body it's it's a bit of an anomaly compared to my later books because I had recorded effectively every work ad I had done since age 16 as a competitive athlete I just I had a lot of records and I kept copious notes on supplement use and everything imaginable so I have what you might call hypergraphia I just capture almost everything in writing and that was very useful because various points in time let's just say I looked at a photograph of myself from making this up but 2004 and I think I would like to look and feel like that again okay let me revisit my workout logs let me just replicate the preceding three to six months of workouts and look at my intake and my diet at the time and lo and behold more or less I could replicate the same type of look and feel and performance so I had a lot already logged that I thought was worth examining and putting up under scrutiny trying to replicate with other people I do think replication is really important and then when it came time to commit to writing the book I thought about what types of mini books would be of great interest to me personally and that book like many of my other books was written in such a fashion that it could be a Choose Your Own Adventure book did not need to be read in fact in many ways it shouldn't be read linearly from page one to the end you get to pick and choose which chapter chapters are of Interest based on breath hold vertical jump endurance hypertrophy cold exposure for fat loss whatever it might be and then I began talking to people and at the at the very outer bounds of self-experimentation at least in the Bay Area it's a pretty small community so you're one or two lily pads from just about everyone and it's not accidental that I put myself in that environment in San Francisco specifically and more generally in the Bay Area Silicon Valley because there's just a high surface area for luck to stick to because you have so many serendipitous encounters you have so many people focusing on different disciplines that I think was the fertilizer and the fertile ground for everything else was actually the choosing the wear of writing physically being located in San Francisco and then when I'm structuring things maybe I'll get into some of the nitty-gritty but I was using at the time and I still like to use a program called scrivener which is actually designed predominantly for screenwriting it's used for many things now novels and so on it's expanded its reached quite a bit but it allows you to gather research and all of your documents and drafts so that you can move them around in very novel ways so you can view say a split pane of your research and what you're working on simultaneously with without having to toggle between a lot of different windows and I was very promiscuous in my gathering of data so I would gather from say the web using a Web Clipper from Evernote which I was involved with as a company and basically without bias capture as much as possible put three asterisks next to anything that I thought I really might want to revisit after I had read something a second time which I would always do then I could controll F to find just three asterisks because they don't occur much in normal writing just like people authors writers will you use TK meaning find such and such a date data needs to be inserted later but I don't want to interrupt the flow of writing let me put in TK because it doesn't really appear in natural English much uh in terms of structured thinking the way I approached it was during that period of time in my life it was interviews tracking people down conversations emails reading so ingestion let's just say for the workday then a break for training and and actually using myself as the human guinea pig for various things that had surfaced that might be on the docket where were you training at that time San Francisco is not uh famous for amazing gyms it's not famous for amazing gyms at the time I was training mostly at a Climbing Gym called Mission Cliffs they didn't have much but they had barbells and they had and they had kettle bells I also had in the in the walkway leading from the front door of the apartment I was renting it was more of a house the front door all the way to the first set of stairs there were 30 K kettle bells so various types and I was training for certification because I wanted to put myself on some type of deadline with accountability for that type of training to get a better understanding of it so trained for a few hours I also had developed a friendship with Kelly starett so San Francisco CrossFit who I have tremendous amount of respect for likewise on multiple levels and his new book yeah built to move his great book he's so good yeah he he really not only talks the talk but walks the walk and exemplifies many of the capabilities that he teaches which I take seriously I like practitioners not just the people with pretty theories although the theories are important I prefer to see someone who can actually put them into practice so Kelly served that function uh certainly and we're still very close friends and then after that all right shake off the cobwebs get the body moving get the brain moving also eat and then I would actually focus on synthesis so I would write generally from let's call it 900 p.m. or 10 p.m. through to 4 or 5 a.m. and I would ride the wave if I happened to be in the zone if I weren't in the zone I wouldn't force it and I would try to get more sleep but I have always performed best with my writing in those witching hours of let's call it 10: p.m. to 4:00 a.m. and my experience is that the writers I've interviewed the the writer friends I've become close with if you look at when they made themselves not necessarily what they do now right but what they did that eventually got them to escape velocity they're almost always doing most of their writing very late at night or very early in the morning when the rest of the world or their social group is inactive wow yeah and I say wow because uh of course all of this was prior to the publication of Matt Walker's seminal book right why we sleep which I really see as the book that shifted a lot of people fortunately from the I'll sleep when I'm dead mindset uh to I'll you know to really paying attention to it and um you know I don't think that gets enough credit I mean there uh there's been a revision of a few points within that book but the majority of it is just spot on and Hyper legitimate so good and um and yet what you're describing is a schedule that you know starting to write at 900 p.m. and finishing up around 4:00 a.m. but you talked about research earlier that day and training and eating so were there naps in there I would sleep from say 4: to maybe 11 or 12 so I would be getting up later and I've had conversations with Matt about this and there are night owls and morning Larks and there are certainly differences in the code meaning the genetics but that worked very very well for me for a very long time it is however a very challenging social schedule so once you have a significant other and every girlfriend I've ever had is a morning person if you want to spend time together that schedule just does not work so I made compromises later for the social side of things but if if you put a gun to my head and said you need to write the best book humanly possible that is your only priority outside of some exercise and fuel I would follow the same schedule I know several um very successful podcasters Lex fredman in particular who I think he's trying to follow a more normal schedule now but he's pseudo nocturnal at least by my ex my read yeah um and there are couple other uh online content creators um Derek from more plates more dates who's hyperproductive in his domain and is mostly nocturnal um and then as you're describing your writing routine and your overall routine I was thinking that you know the the great skateboarder everyone knows Tony Hawk who is obviously a great skateboarder no doubt about that but Rodney Mullen who invented the all on Street the kickflip the all like Rodney is basically nocturnal and has been for a long time and would you know skateboard up and down the bordwalk in Santa Monica in the middle of the night because lack of distraction is really was and he's been doing that since his teens I don't know what he's doing these days but I think a lot of creators just need space and and I always wonder if that's because when they at least the ones that are not uh socially dysfunctional like yourself who when they are around people there's this almost hopefully a desire to interact so you almost have to remove the stimulus completely yeah it it it removes the plausible deniability which might not be the perfect use of that phrase but in the sense that you it's harder to fool yourself into thinking you're doing something important when you're checking your messages or social media at 2: in the morning who are we kidding folks you should be writing in this case right and writers will do anything to avoid writing I remember IR Rand wrote a book about writing which is actually fantastic I can't remember the exact title it might just be on non-fiction writing something like that and she talked about polishing the sneakers or the shoes before writing like I really just need to do this one thing which is to just clean up that shoe because somebody should really clean it up and at some point I should clean it up and therefore why don't I just do there's no time like the present I'll just do that it's all to avoid writing which is the harder thing and in my conversations with Matt also I should say that as someone who has self-described as a person who struggles with onset insomnia Matt made the point and sometimes we need to relearn things maybe you should just go to bed later sure and that might address some of this onset insomnia and I don't know the causes for that but I do get a Second Wind very late could be related to some cortisol release abnormality or just different scripting in my system who knows I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's athletic greens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 I'll mention one other one other maybe shuris that I use for trying to peek around Corners which is if I find an example of an outlier trying to find two or three right because one is an exception two is interesting three is worth investigating that's sort of how I think about it and I recognize the plural of anecdote does not equal data however a lot of interesting discoveries begin as case studies or case histories and so there are some things we could talk about that that I've paid attention to over the last few years that are not in the for our body that I think are quite interesting and raise very very exciting questions uh but I'd love to hear about those yeah and and along the lines of what I call anic data I mean most of what we know about human memory stems from one patient hm who had his hippocampi removed for epilepsy and of course there have been Millions probably close to millions of studies in animals and humans focusing on the hippocampi but most of what we know about human memory is from one guy yeah yeah exactly so there's there's there's a lot to be examined not all of it will get funding for rcts let's be realistic this is especially true if you're hoping for any type of directive data and notice I'm not saying conclusive but if if you are a human who's going to be making decisions about diet Health exercise if you want any consensus you're doomed you'll be you're not going to get any answers before you die can you say that twice so that the internet can hear it extra loud and clear for those of you that are arguing about nutrition on Twitter like it it might actually be life wasted yeah I mean I'm not being judgmental I mean I think that there's validity in lots of those Pockets there's stuff that's wrong in lots of those Pockets yeah um their diets that work extremely well like you know 4-Hour diet or slow carb I always call the 4our diet but the Slow Carb Diet it works extremely well anytime I've followed it you I get much leaner and stronger and all that stuff um uh that it's uh purported to do it it works um but yeah maybe you could just uh explain what you mean by that because I think there are some argument slf friction spaces that that are truly an energy sync yeah I would just say focus on what works for you and your family or your team and if you're arguing on the internet recognize that you're just doing it because you like arguing on the internet you're not going to convince anyone of anything and uh you're just going to make yourself uh more frustrated if you plan on changing any opinions so for me it's Live and Let Live and uh the more people who engage in that type of behavior the more competitive Advantage do you have if you don't so for me I'm like okay if you want to spend this vital non-renewable resource of yours called time on that if I ever compete against you I'm going to win so great I'll just uh I'll I'll also not even try to convin you to stop doing that unless you see the logic in it which I have which is why I also don't have at least for two years have mostly had no social apps installed on my phone uh and we could talk about that because I think recognizing that these things have been engineered to overcome any type of self-discipline with billions of dollars at stake uh should lead you to believe that you're bringing a a knife to a gunfight so I just don't have the apps on my phone to begin with and I find it much more gratifying to see disproportionate change from small inputs so that's what I'm looking for and I'm also looking for changes that are easy to make that can have high adherence that have very limited downside which is very different from proving something for instance in the 4our body took a look at the potential effect of cell phones or the proximity of cell phones to say gadal function and reproductive health and the literature that was available at the time was very limited had some animal studies mice rats Etc I recognize humans are not just large mice so they don't always translate but I looked at I said okay looking at this simplistically is it plausible that there could be similar effects on humans seems to be the case also based on conversations with people people who are Specialists but would never go on record therefore if your phone is in your pocket just have it on airplane mode I mean it it does not have a high cost and and then pending any revision we can see but while the jury is still out I'm going to risk mitigate by taking this step yeah well and I just want to say thank you there too I read that recommendation I followed the recommendation of not keeping the phone on in my front pocket or back pocket um and that's anic data um my sperm analysis isn't relevant to this conversation but worked out but you know you could say well that's not necessarily because you had the phone off but um I did a very long detailed episode on male and female fertility there is now a what I view as a really quality metaanalysis and it's pretty clear that there are effects of the smartphone on proximity of the smartphone when it's turned on uh that are not good for sperm isn't necessarily going to render somebody sterile but um on sperm that can be separated out from the heat effects and so essentially this is another instance in which uh you were you were right um and I think more data will come out and am I a EMF conspiracy theorist uh no um do I wear tinfoil underwear no um but uh I think it's interesting I think it's important and uh thanks to you um queued my attention to it in fact I I teach about that in a a course on on neural circuits and biology and health and disease amazing and I don't expect to get everything right at all that would be crazy i' like to think I'm not totally crazy and it's very important if you are going to do self- experimentation or experimentation in small groups which the Quantified Self community did quite well and I think still does quite well you should really make every effort to not fool yourself which is hard it's it's challenging at times but read books like bad science read books like How to lie with Statistics ensure that you are able to read studies well you don't have to be the best in the world but that you can on some level identify the strengths and weaknesses of studies this doesn't take a long time certainly our friend petera Dr petera has studying studies which is a multiple part blog series dedicated to this there are other ways to approach it I took one of his podcasts republished it on the Tim Farah show because it talked about how to examine studies what powering refers to things like this in the span of one or two weeks you could really become literate with the building blocks of scientific literacy with respect to reading studies and that gives you such an enormous life Advantage it's hard hard to overstate yeah I agree and I also think that there are a lot of things that just simply will not ever be explored in a randomized control trial um one of the things that Peter and I have talked about before is he texts me you know what are your thoughts on bpc157 this is a gastric peptide that's now been synthesized so people will inject it into a tissue that they're trying to heal or improve lots and lots of anic data on bpc157 making injuries heal faster Etc again anic data I've used it I took an injection of it yesterday in fact um Peter basically is not a Believer because there a lack of published data on this which is perfectly fine or I should say he's um skeptical um and so there's always that possibility of a placebo effect but I don't think there will ever be a really nice controlled trial on bpc 1570 because the financial incentives aren't there and no smart graduate student is going to go do a thesis on this that so that's a reality I mean maybe one will do it now that we're having this conversation but it just doesn't that the payout isn't there yeah and that last one you mentioned is one that people miss a lot people doing these studies are people with careers who are planning their careers and so they choose what they're going to invest time in very carefully so that's another limiter on what will end up in an RCT or not right so uh I think that's good for people to hear and as you get more involved with science and in my case through a foundation you know Cay Foundation funding a lot of early stage science you realize how expensive it is and how long it takes it is a long-term investment and if you are looking to make behavioral changes or modify aspects of yourself cognitive physical psycho emotional or otherwise identifying interventions right options that seem to have some plausible upside like there is a a mechanism that might make sense in humans if you feel fairly certain there's very limited downside which should include talking to people who are presenting their results as anic data then maybe you consider using X if you can cap your downside right and I recall for instance looking at trans Resveratrol specifically not for longevity but in potentially increasing endurance for for our body and I ended up testing it and there's a funny story associated with that didn't quite work out as planned and I don't use it any longer but what I experienced prior to actually finding this on forums was joint pain elbow pain the one most consistent side effect was what felt like tendonosis in the elbows and then I went online and I'd already done this but I hadn't come across I think it was the 500 group people have been using 500 milligrams of trans res trol daily for long periods of time and one of the most common reported side effects is joint pain and I was like okay I'm not willing to make that trade-off yeah and makes sense to me yeah I think um it would be fun if ever you were willing that we could do uh a hybrid podcast on supplement fails I have some spectacular failures as do I and I'm thinking I'm thinking about a few of them I mean some that were really um like took me off course like there's one supplement uh called bulbine natalensis this is another another one of these shrubs sounds like an infection I mean this thing will really spike your testosterone and free testosterone I'm talking back acne like huge strength gains aggression it's really wild and then after about seven to 10 days it all crashes and you go below Baseline oh sounds Terri yeah even testicular pain so it was unclear so you if you're a smart person you use right so I can understand why people are skeptical of certain things and then of course there are supplements that I'm a big fan of and that you're a big fan of we talked about those things elsewhere but um it might be fun to do supplement fails podcast if ever you were willing that would I could do just experimental fails oh yeah yeah n of one experimental fails which include things that people might not think about for instance for our body had quite a bit of real estate dedicated to looking at things like PRP so PL rich plasma I think there's a rooll for it it's not useful for everything but for certain types of injury or repair I think it's very interesting um but uh every time you get injected this is where you have to be careful because there are very few free lunches out there there's there's usually some type of feedback loop your system is very smart at Auto regulating things this is this is outside of that a consideration that I hadn't made which is every time you have an injection there's a chance of an infection particularly if the sight in my case was the elbow and the injection was made for the PRP not quite where it should have been slightly to the rear of the elbow where the the skin is very thick and so it pushed uh staff bacteria from a mid layer of the skin into the joint capsule not good and that really could have ended very poorly I ended up having to go to the ER and get it get it all removed and so on but that could have ended up uh in a in a much much more severe situation so you do have to be careful with this stuff I've become a little more conservative with some what I do including injections I'm like all right like let me think twice about the injections if I'm going to swallow something let me make sure I'm really looking at the implications for the liver yeah smart very smart I'm curious about some of the things that you talked about in the 4-Hour Body and the that you've mentioned today things like accelerometers continuous glucose monitors deliberate cold exposure how many of those things are you still doing on a regular basis and how many do you um you know use a couple times a week or a couple times a month or go through phases of using and not using cold exposure I use as consistently as is practical so if I'm traveling it's a little harder but we're in LA right now one of the first things I did was find a few options for contrast therapy MH one of the first things I did and by contrast I do not mean infrared sauna and cold plunge I'd much rather have hot and cold water just in terms of sort of speed of heating the Japanese approach right for just speed of vasod dilation particularly for injury recovery I think it's incredibly helpful for mood regulation certainly that's the case and cold water for mood regulation or the treatment of say depression or as a pre Ive intervention to avoid or mitigate depression is old used to be prescribed for melancholy and people like the Vos of the world would be prescribed cold baths so that was something I was like well let's take a look at some of the old history read about that and then look into PubMed and so on to see what might be supported so the cold I'm still using I become increasingly interested this was not in the 4-Hour Body but whole body hyperthermia often excluding the head for depression which I know there's some some research UCSF ex right now yeah really interesting studies too early to report I'm not involved in these but I think these are really important studies because for all the people saying oh well you know it's ice bath stuff you know metabolism this metabolism that one thing that's very clear is long lasting very significant increase in the catacol means dopamine epinephrine norepinephrine um not a replacement perhaps for anti-depressant medication but as you said to to move the needle toward anti-depressant States um that's the cocktail and um heat as well yeah yeah and the hypothermia especially the way is formatted right now with some of the research is is very early stages there's going to be less adherence it's not as readily available say cold shower cold bath so I do think about the Practical implications of that but right now it's it's very interesting slow carb diet still use it all the time it is not my default 247 as it us used to be so maybe I'm just getting older and more self-indulgent but if I find myself going off the rails a bit and I'm like okay I'm getting closer to Muffin Top here let's stage an intervention then I will go immediately back to slow carb diet and within within a matter of weeks it's it's pretty easily corrected and just a cue for people I know it's um you know slow carb diet um achieved great prominence in fact wasn't it featured on uh or mentioned in an episode of Orange Is the New Black I it might have been it's made it's made appearances on a handful of shows great I realized that I've been referring to the Slow Carb Diet several times throughout this discussion so for those that aren't familiar with the Slow Carb Diet I know they can go look up what that is but so that we can keep them here uh for the rest of this discussion and not have to send them out and back uh just yet um could you give us just a brief top Contour of what the slow carb diet is sure so slow carb diet is intended to be a simple easy to adhere to diet for people who have perhaps failed other diets that allows you to recompose your body so improve muscle mass decrease body fat percentage and the rules are really simple and that's part of what makes it work it's not ideal for every sport in every circumstance but broadly speaking it works for a lot of people who've had trouble with dieting in the past so rule number one don't drink calories that's it very simple so black coffee unsweetened tea great juice out anything with calories out you could add a little bit of heavy cream to your coffee let's say uh but that's that's also bending the rules in a way that I don't like so in the beginning it's like follow the rules so you can break them later so in the beginning let's just say you can't drink calories number two don't eat anything white sounds pretty basic right just don't eat anything that is the color of white or that could be white basically that means you're going to be avoiding starches and uh things that are are similar to starches that includes things like oatmeal that includes things like oatmeal so roughly speaking just avoiding things that are white or that could be white will get you pretty far and yes there are exceptions like cauliflower fine you can have cauliflower but again don't get fancy right it's it's very easy to outsmart yourself when it comes to behavioral change keep it simple so for at least two weeks forget about the exceptions right don't drink calories don't eat anything white and then eat 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up okay got that and then there are a few buckets you can choose from right so you have vegetables beans and lentils uh and then some type of protein so you're going to come up with meals that you can follow without deviating for a period of one or two weeks just come up with the same meals and that's going to sound boring yes but guess what you do it already you just might not realize it and the the lentils and the beans specifically as a prere we can get into some of the reasons but add a lot of fiber and also inhibit appetite right so that's actually a very important component of these meals and there may be a handful of other rules but those are the basics and then the Redemption is take one day off per week and just go crazy that that's cheat day there are some epic cheat days out there some I've captured for myself and anything goes when I say anything I do mean anything so if you want to consume multiple pizzas pints of ice cream whatever indulge I left one out no fruit during the week so avoid fruit avoid fructose so agave nectar anything that is sort of hidden sugar avoid all that uh it's a no added sweeteners obviously but avoid avoid fruit and fructose and again it's not going to kill you guess what if you're from European ancestry your ancestry did not have like blueberries in the middle of winter generally speaking right so you'll you'll be fine for a few weeks um and then there's that cheat day and cheat day anything goes the amount of damage you can do on cheat day is pretty limited and there are ways you can mitigate that there's a whole chapter called damage control in the 4our body but focusing just on that diet and having one one day off where you know you can do anything means when you are controlling yourself for those six days of the week you're not giving up your favorite foods forever you can even keep a list of all things you want to eat on cheap day and then you have free license to eat on cheap day and that provides you with a release valve so that you can build in the cheating as opposed to having it occur as a failure point there are a handful of other things there if you have Domino Foods in the house for instance if you eat a lot of almonds or mixed nuts and you're just going to sit there compulsively eating them while you're sitting at your laptop don't have what I call dominoe Foods in the house which are going to really create some portion control issues but broadly speaking don't drink calories don't e things that are white take from three categories and build your meals out and those are the meals that you follow do not eat fruit or fructose and then cheat one day a week and Saturday is a nice day or cheat day for most folks FKS and uh just to answer some questions people are going to have no that doesn't mean 24 hours that you can spread out over two days that will actually say you back but the amount of fat that you can store in a handful of sittings over 24 hours which legitimately is more like 12 to 18 hours pretty limited um so that's slow grab diet great thank you for that I also want to ask is it okay to take the day after cheat day and fast or do one meal that day when I followed the Slow Carb Diet I benefited from it tremendously lost fat gained muscle tons of energy sleeping great uh required less caffeine all sorts of wonderful things stable blood sugar I felt so so good um really enjoyed the cheat days I really really enjoyed the cheat days so much fun um at some point there's some gastric distress that comes from you know not regulating intake um which led me to not want to eat the the next day MH um so I tended to do the cheat days on Sunday in my case um and then I would fast most of Monday just water black coffee tea and then I might have a small meal in the evening and then by Tuesday I was back on the Slow Carb died does that seem like a um an uh sort of a detrimental deviation from the from the plan I think that if that is what works for you then that is what works for you so this is this this the Slow Carb Diet template for me is a starting point and generally I'll say I think this is from Picasso right it's like learn the rules as an amateur so you can break them as a professional but it's like I recommend most people kind of stick with the format for a handful of weeks and measure the results right there so there are guidelines for how to measure the the scale is a bit of a blunt instrument so there are other ways but if you're extremely overweight you can just use the scale and fasting I think is fine or just ratcheting back your chloric consumption significantly uh and what happens over time for most people also is for the first say four weeks on cheat day you're going to go completely insane and I remember I was doing something much stricter called the cyclical ketogenic diet which is a whole separate thing it's much more limiting in terms of what you can eat but I was training for ultimately the Nationals in Chinese kickboxing this was happening in 99 so I was training super hard I was following a cyclical ketogenic diet which meant I could eat very few things but I did have this one cheat day and I would do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand which is one of the things you can do to limit the damage on cheat day do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand and then I would just go crazy I mean I would drive to like crispy K cream by 12 donuts and they would be gone by the time I got home and it wasn't an hour away it was like a 10-minute Drive Donuts would be gone right I would go to Safeway and I would buy a bag of those funsize Snickers and that would be just a tiny portion of my calor stuff for you huh a lot of sweet stuff I also did the Savory stuff I mean I had my favorites nothing was safe Pizza nothing was safe nothing was safe my my Paws got into everything and then over time because the next day you're going to feel like you got hit by a diabetic dump truck you start ratcheting back and you're like okay maybe I don't need to do that maybe cheat day will just be two meals or maybe cheat day will just be like the pastries in the morning with the coffee and you start to regulate a bit generally you don't have to but over time you generally will and I think after you've followed it to the tea just follow the Commandments for say four to eight weeks then you can certainly deviate and I'm not saying if you're not hungry don't eat however in many cases people have they have acclimated to not eat eating in the morning and then they end up overeating later in the day if you have that habit right if you're consuming 50% of your calories or more at dinner and you want to lose body fat I would say get some cottage cheese or something that will give you 30 grams easily in the morning worst case scenario use a protein of some type just don't make it hypercaloric you mean powdered protein like could be powdered way powdered way protein whole food is going to do a lot more MH and no calorie counting correct no calorie counting tends to be self-limiting when you're eating this much fiber and this much protein it tends to be very self-limiting what you'll want to consume and what you can consume yeah once again I had great experiences with slow carb diet and um I'm going to go back on yeah and nobody and uh nobody needs to buy anything to figure it out if you just search on tim. blog slow carb diet there you'll get everything that you need to get started no purchase necessary well it works very very well I'll say that and it's very straightforward to follow and it does include the the notorious uh cheat day uh Infamous cheat day um uh and it can be done um on a on a very reasonable budget and so if people want to learn more about that they should go to Tim's blog on 4our uh um 4our body and um slow carb diet we'll provide a link but it's you know I think it's worth highlighting again just how effective that is you know as you pointed out thousands and thousands of people um using it to great success some of whom were um quite obese and um yeah any updates on those folks are they still keeping the weight off I would like to do a followup uh it's I think with diets in general there's a lot of reversion to the mean you know regression to the mean so I would expect that that some have kept it off and some have not that would be true of I think every possible diet especially for people who are overcoming beh avoral inertia of having gained hundreds of pounds but uh I'd like to do some followup what was fun about the post I put together called how to lose 100 pounds on the Slow Carb Diet we had we profiled say four or five people but there were dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and this was a very long time ago so I would say that a long-term followup would be super interesting and we did at one point track several thousand people through a platform of the time I think it was coach.me as they follow the Sol carb diet for the first four to 12 weeks and that was fascinating because I want the data and I'm happy to be proven incorrect with any of my assumptions I mean I I don't view that as a failure me I view that as as a huge net gain and uh it has a very high adherence rate so I I pay attention to not just is something effective does it get you the outcome you want not only is it efficient from a Time and resource perspective but how high is the adherence rate right so if you take a random sampling of a thousand people from the US across socioeconomic classes Etc how many people practically speaking will be able to or willing to follow this for say an eight-week period of time or four-week period of time and I try to optimize for the widest adherence because I know the the sil CB I people come on they're like what but what about intermittent fasting what about this and what about endurance athletes I'm like this is not for everybody in cases it just happens to be a good default diet with a high adherence rate and like you said it's very inexpensive it can be followed very very inexpensively could sorry to interrupt you one thing that I really like about it is that um many uh variants on caloric restriction which is because laws of thermodynamics definitely apply folks we're not we're not trying to say they don't um but one of the issues with a lot of things including intermittent fasting which I sort of do some variant of because I'm not really hungry to eat until about 11:00 I like to train in the morning if I can Etc is that they can sometimes prevent best performance in terms of especially resistance training high-intensity resistance training so very low carb diets I've tried them um even if you're paying attention to you know other ways to restock glycogen it performance drops off whereas a slow carb diet I feel like I can think I can work I can exercise I can sleep like everything just works well but there's one thing in it that I wanted to raise that I when I heard this I thought there's no way this is true which was uh making sure that you get 30 or so grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking yeah and I thought how can that be like how can adding protein early in the day actually make a difference and it really did work I was I still track my numbers so in terms of dropping body fat percentage increasing muscle it really does work now whether or not that's simply because it's offsetting food intake that I would have um food that I would have taken in later in the day I don't know I I don't I'm not going to make myself my own control experiment to the point that I drive myself crazy yeah but um it really does work quite well um to get past sticking points to just get that 30 g of protein early so violate the the uh um Tim restricted feeding component deliberately with some protein in the morning y then still train and do all the other things and you know carry on as usual and it's just so it seems so peculiar like eating more and and losing body fat but it works yeah it's counterintuitive and a lot of approaches can work for a lot of different people right to State the OB but this particular aspect of this low carb diet is helpful for let's just say the majority of the people in that thousand person sample I was talking about the hypothetical Pole from different parts of say the us or anywhere because it it it seems to help with a few things first there's just the thermic effect of food and for protein there's a greater thermic effect you also have and I think there's there's decent at the time there was decent literature to support this so I don't know if it's changed that the protein intake along those lines has an appetite suppressing effect so the The Net Daily calories consumed tends to be less when someone has a higher protein meal earlier in the day and last but not least I will say one of the risks and there are many people who execute well on this but you have to be very meticulous which is true of the ketogenic diet as well you can get yourself into a lot of trouble if you do it 60% right or 70% right you're really you can get yourself in there massive psoriasis I mean my scalp you know slopping off from like when I'm in ketosis and going like what the hell is going on you're going back on some complex carbohydrates and it going away yeah I exactly I don't need I don't need a randomized control trial to know I simply don't want to run that experiment your scalp yeah so in the case of say Tim restricted feeding some people who do intermittent fasting lose a lot of muscle mass and there are multiple reasons for this I I think people should make use of relatively widely available tools like dexa and so on to ensure that your composition is actually moving the way you think it's moving uh make sure you standardize your hydration for that as well as time of day just Pro tip that's true for blood tests as well but it seems to get net net better effects than trying to teach people how to fast effectively which you can do and we can talk about fasting that's something that was not included in the 4-Hour Body that were I to rewrite it today I would include a section and there was a bit in tools of Titans to address that on more extended fasts let's just call it three to 7 day fasts uh so that's an area that's of of great interest to me as is ketosis and metabolic Psychiatry I'll Chris Palmer yeah who we both know incredible I mean what he's what the Awakening that he's uh created through his book and going on your podcast my podcast and others and and you know letting people be aware that changes in diet can impact mental health so I think in two three years it's going to be a duh and we're not just talking about the difference between you know um slamming back horrible Foods horrible for US Foods versus eating really clean I mean really specific diet protocols to treat mental health incredible yeah super exciting so that's that's one of the things that I'm paying a lot of attention to right now they're a handful in that r within the just say the the interplay of Mind and Body since The cartisian Duality and separation of this too makes no sense from a biological standpoint so um that's that's something that certainly captured my attention and I paid a lot of attention to even as far back as early 2000s uh for mental health and just cognitive performance I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be assessed with a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood in DNA tests out there however is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information about what to do with all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids ET ET and then to assess what sorts of Behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health for this week only the week of June 19th 2023 insid tracker is offering a buy one get one free on their ultimate plan this is their best discount of the year you can get this offer by going to insidetracker docomo again that's insidetracker docomo thanks for uh revisiting some of the 4-Hour Body and slow carb diet and elaborating on um some of the process that went into that and I think uh creators of all kinds thinkers of all kinds and people who are interested in the contents of the 4our body are going to be uh very grateful for that information I certainly am fascinated by your process um one of the things that you mentioned along the lines of process was you know the power of places and where one happens to live I think there's a essay by Paul Graham that talks about this it's a little outdated um you know and it talks about the messages that you um the tacit messages of being in certain cities I think it was you know like Boston you're not smart enough um uh what was it it was New York uh you're not powerful enough uh and not you I just thinking and um or you should be more powerful is the message like the tcid message um Los Angeles um what you're what you're doing people aren't paying attention paying enough attention to it like that messages these are stereotypes about cities certainly cities change um the role of places is an interesting one like you know you mentioned you know small gathering Kevin Kelly's house Quantified Self and I think for people who don't know people like that right um maybe we could get your thoughts on you know how would one think about where to live and and maybe even curating their own Gatherings useful Gatherings because it's not that uh I have to imagine it's not that you guys sat back and like I'm Tim Ferris he's like I'm Kevin Kelly let's have a gathering so we can talk about it in a few years on a podcast this stuff happens MH that word you know it's dangerous word organically um when people who have common interest decide to get together and talk and listen and brainstorm and I'm yet to do that in a you know with good people and not have something really incredible come out of it not necessarily that day yeah but looking five years looking back five years later and just God that was really worthwhile totally yeah few thoughts in no particular order I would say the first is it depends my recommendations depend a lot on where you are in the Arc of your career in life if you are in full growth hyperdrive mode and you are trying to build both yourself and your capabilities in a very concentrated way where you're not necessarily focused on family maybe have fewer obligations then if you're serious I think many people should consider moving to an area of high density for a period of time it could be three months it could be six months could be longer but putting yourself in a New York or an LA or San Francisco or Chicago or as new places develop I'll I'll give you one you might not expect say in Ottawa Canada where Shopify is based and the presence and growth of Shopify has spawned an entire ecosystem of startups so there may be options outside of the usual cast of characters Pittsburgh and dualingo similar effect so there are more options than people might recognize but taking a journey and placing yourself in a place where you can be in a very active pinball machine where you may interact act serendipitously with many different people from many different worlds I think is is is hard to overstate the value of and my drive and my filtering function let's just say because when I first got to the Bay Area nobody cared about me I was nobody I was driving my mom's used minivan hand me down that had the seats stolen out of the back it Terri were you in the South Bay I was I was working in San Jose yeah I mean no disrespect to San Jose I'm from the South Bay yeah but there's a there's a bleakness to the South there is there is a little bit of bleakness and then I lived across the street in this tiny apartment lived across street from the Jack in the Box in Mountain View so it's not like I was strolling onto the big stage and just blowing people away oh I I I I grew up right near Mountain View I'm very familiar probably skated the curbs at that Jack did you train at the Golds Gym in off rang store did actually amazing that was a great gym that was a great gym that was a great gym I don't think it's still there I'll go there super late before my writing sessions okay and it had the benefit of being open really really late and wow rang St haven't thought about that in a long time so the point is I also started where a lot of people are starting and what did I do I put myself in a high density environment next what did I do knowing no one I started to volunteer at events where they had interesting speakers and interesting people coming to hear those speakers so I put myself in Silicon Valley and then then I began volunteering for groups like svas I don't know if it exists anymore the Silicon Valley Association of startup entrepreneurs I think it was Tai the indust entrepreneur which is a very sort of Indian or indian-american focused organization that does a lot in the realm of startups and I would carry water I would take out garbage I would check name badges I would check people in nothing was too low for me and I'll give you guys a tip that will be obvious to some but nonobvious to many when you're are volunteering a lot of folks who volunteer do the absolute bare minimum because they are not getting paid this is not going to get you noticed but it sets a very low bar so that if you volunteer at these events and someone's dropping the ball or there's something happening that needs fixing and you just proactively do it the producers of these events will notice you and this is what happened over time over a few months and then I got invited to join in on meetings that were planning future events and I eventually got to the point where I was recruiting speakers and able to set the agenda for an entire main event and then that's how I got to know say Jack Canfield who is the co-creator of Chicken Soup for the Soul and many others who introduced me to my book agent many many many many years later Jack Campfield but I was a nobody then you have to play the long game but you can be methodical on how you play that and that is one approach just as an example for how to build your network which snowballs over time don't hump every vip's leg within 10 minutes of meeting them play it cool you know and and Gatherings where that person is uh has a lot of Demands on them is the last place you want to do that the way you're going to make yourself saleny to that yeah the way you're going to make yourself memorable with people like that is to be very professional always on time predict what they are going to need or problems they'll run into beforehand and address them before they even think of them and be easy to deal with and people like that high performers notice these things they will make note of it yeah the being easy to work with is something that um I used to tell my graduate students posts I mean it because the opposite of that nobody wants yeah right nobody wants that yeah especially in the beginning like later okay great you're Steve Jobs you want to be difficult here and there or a lot no problem right but in the beginning that can be a real liability you can make up for that if you're the best in the world but in the very beginning you probably won't be uh so try to stack the deck in your favor volunteering is a shortcut and that would be one way of doing it another now especially given the virtual communities that exist so you have subreddits you have online communities you have Twitter groups you have Clubhouse you've got a million different options which can be over overwhelming is Clubhouse still going maybe not I have no idea oh no I don't know I'm not saying it's gone I just I remember during the pandemic there were some Clubhouse Gatherings that hopped on there and but I've sort of forgotten to to get on maybe the the platform Affinity is really fickle which is why I think to the extent possible if you want to build a worldclass and I use that term very deliberately Network in record time just to give you a nice headline I would say focus on the uncrowded channel which is in person it's out of fashion it's out of Vogue going to a conference and actually interacting with humans in the hallway approaching panelists this is another thing that I did I'll give it I'll give another tip so very early on I would go to conferences nobody cared who I was nobody knew who I was fine and I would study the panels let's say I'm going to a big event like South by Southwest and I would this is what I did in 2007 which was just prior to the first book coming out and and I would go to these various in-person events I was focused mostly on events that had uh the Thematic focus of blogs we could come back to that but blogs were what podcasts were a few years ago right they drove incredible traffic but they were undervalued by mainstream media undervalued by mainstream Publishers Etc which meant there was an Arbitrage opportunity in a way and I would pick say a handful of panels with topics I thought were super interesting and then the panel would end and what would happen the panelists would get rushed by various folks because many of them were wellknown who was not getting rushed the moderator I would go straight to the moderator and I would talk to the moderator I'd thank them for the panel i' would be very genuine none of it was made up and talk to them for a bit they would generally ask why I was there what I was interested in I would mention whatever that happened to be in this case it was I'm finishing my first book or I had my first book coming out soon I'm here to hopefully meet people uh who are involved with a or C and then if we hit it off which was not true every time but if it seemed to be going well I would say is I don't know anyone here I'm really sort of orphaned here making my way through uh this entire event is there anyone else here you think I would get along with who maybe I could buy a drink or coffee and vast majority of the time they like oh yeah you should meet so and so and then I get the introduction and then I would meet that person I would have a genuine interaction with that person and if it made sense if things were going well I'd do the same thing is there anybody else here you think I should just say hi to and I get along with not who I can ask for something and that wasn't deception I was being honest like someone I could actually Vibe with and if so would you mind making the intro yeah sure no problem many of those people are still my friends uh and by being surgical in that way not trying to gather business cards to use a really Antiquated metaphor people still hand them out yeah people still hand them out I guess depends on where you are especially like Boston but uh if if rather than trying to collect people as Pokemon cards developing say five three to five deeper relationships through longer conversations at an event that is what directly LED ultimately to the hockey stick for the 4our work week within Tech within specifically San Francisco um so those be a few approaches for for building your network when you don't have the ability to just walk up to say Kevin Kelly and have a conversation that came over time yeah whether or not it's um Health practices or uh nutritional practices or at meetings seems you're oriented toward the crowded but very interesting people in spaces MH but the key word there I think is uncrowded and of course the other key word is interesting right I mean it's not like you're standing in the parking lot talking to whoever happens to be there although that can be interesting right there's a Serendipity there and you know there's always um things to learn from people but in terms of uh career advancement and and building new ideas and forging for information I'm just struck how you've done that over and over um and again thank you for uh giving giving us some insight into the process please all right here's another one so I think there's a tendency among people who want to develop their networks or their relationships to be star not to get too technical but that's a technical term yeah yeah and they want to tell other people they are friends with someone more than they want to develop skills or learn from someone this puts you in a very disadvantaged position because then that means all right you want become friends with Elon Musk good luck or you want to become friends with this a-lister celebrity who everyone else wants to meet good luck it's going to be a crowded bloody path to get there and by the way they've also certainly developed really attuned defenses against people like you so it's G to be hard on the they have staff to prevent they have a fance of protectors to prevent you from ever getting to that person on on the other hand if you're approaching it from the standpoint of developing skills learning and actually becoming potential friends with someone give you an example you could go after you want to become better at boxing let's just make that up all right maybe not the greatest example skiing would be another one but let's let's stick with boxing just because of the way I'll explain it if you wanted to say get personalized lessons from Floyd Mayweather it can happen okay let's go then maybe a step down out of the pro ranks to gold medalist okay if it's a brand new gold medalist let's just say like Oscar De La Hoya when he was really The Golden Boy and it just thrashed everyone still going to be hard what about the silver medalist who just had a bad day when he had that last bout against Oscar De La Hoya potentially right from a technical perspective from a personal connection perspective you may have more in common with that person or bronze medalist and they can get you 70 809 0% of the way there and by the way you probably don't have the physical attributes to make it to 100% anyway if you're coming to it this late and you could get in many cases one-on-one lessons whether in person or virtually with someone who is of that caliber they're in the same front of the pack as the names I just mentioned maybe not as famous 100 bucks 200 bucks per hour for a lot of people that is Within Reach yeah I'm not sure what the value of saying one knows somebody very famous is it's just never been something that I've oriented to it's a common orientation though yeah and uh I think that's true for a lot of things like many people use say psychedelics because they want to tell other people the story that they have of doing psychedelics right they're not doing it intrinsically for what they hope to get out of that experience maybe there's part of them but it's more more the social signaling and validation they get when they project that out at a group dinner into a story that they can tell and that's true for many things so one of the questions I ask myself with all sorts of things if I could never talk about this would I do it what a what a great great right thing to think about right like if I could if I could have let's just say we didn't know each other and I was like okay I'm earlier in my career let's apply some constraints so I'm not where I am I still want to do abnc in the public eye maybe I want to build a podcast whoever if I could meet with you but I could never tell a soul would I do it I don't know would you I would I would I would too but but for a lot of folks if they meaning I'd meet with you I'm not saying I'd meet with me by the way I'd mean with me you know the believe me I meet with me all the time and sometimes it's pretty unpleasant yeah and and that can be applied to all sorts of things right it's like and it's it's a useful question because I as myself this for examining your motivations and I'm not saying one motivation is always better than another but it's it's you should at least be aware of your driving motivations because you can end up playing games you're not even aware you're playing and that's how you end up I think getting into a lot of trouble in life one of the ways so that would be a question I might apply I apply other questions like there's a great question uh that Seth Goden applies who really I admire tremendously and has built an incredibly unorthodox unique life for himself and his family he's he he's zigged when everyone would expect him to zag and I I and he always has a defensible logic behind it and much like Derek cers but most people have probably heard the hypothetical question like what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail right or what would you do if you couldn't fail and Seth turns that around I think that's a good question but he turns around he said what would you do if you knew you were going to fail in terms of identifying what you would do for the process right what would you do if you knew it was going to fail okay you're considering these five different projects let's say they're all going to fail but you still have to choose one of the five which would you choose yeah that's a great question um much harder to answer yeah and you know at the same time I'm called back to uh when I was a graduate student and still now with the podcast uh I have this um litmus test um which is you know is the experiment that I'm working on the one that I want to be working on most is the podcast that I'm working on the one that I want to be working on most I mean there's truly no other podcast I'd rather be having today than this one right and the moment I'm starting to think oh I wish I was doing that thing over there I realize I'm off Target I'm off Target and um uh I think that asking really good questions is something clearly that you're very good at and uh getting a little bit deeper into your process around that do you write those things down like is there a Notebook someplace in the Kingdom of uh of Tim Ferris in Austin or elsewhere um that says you know those questions that that essentially those questions are written are they yeah I collect I I literally have a document with questions that I've gathered from Seth printed out and at the Airbnb where I'm staying here so you brought it with you I printed it out here and then I went through and I read it last night and I was highlighting questions from past interviews I've had with him on my podcast to revisit his questions so I I was literally doing that last last night over dinner and I collect questions I collect questions if I am reading a magazine and I come across a good question I take take a photo or I capture it somehow in notes or in Evernote which I know is kind of oldfashioned these days but I've used it for everything so the critical mass is beyond enormous and I do collect and revisit these things I capture them in journals as well but I I absolutely capture good questions when I find them questions are so powerful for the brain I don't want to go into this in too much detail because I have a lot more questions for you but uh we just wrapped a series on Mental Health um that will come out later this year with Paul kti and he um is brilliant as we both know and uh does truly important work and um and he pointed to the value of asking really good questions about oneself and the because of the way that questions that are really directed at self-inquiry ceue up the subconscious so you asked the question question and unlike a statement or a meme um the brain works with that in in the days and hours after asking the question in ways that um simple declarative statements probably don't ping the system the same way which is probably why we can see so many points of wisdom and Truth everywhere and it doesn't necessarily transform us but asking really good questions really does seem to transform us yeah there there's uh I think judging people by their questions is it's also a shortcut to assessing and learning a lot about how someone functions and what makes them tick I think it was volter who said you know judge a man by his questions not by his answers something along those lines but when in doubt attribute to volter it sounds good does sound good and I I think about this a lot I do think about the questions and I refine the questions that I ask myself especially while journaling because it's easier to cross-examine and stress test your own certainty and beliefs when they are captured on paper or digitally on a laptop for instance so I I do routinely revisit certain questions that I found helpful over time I mean one that people can play with is with whatever is really causing you consternation or stress at the moment some kind of decision a relationship business could be anything just what might this this look like if it were easy right what might this look like if it were easy if it had to be easy if that were possible what might it look like and that could apply to anything it could apply to anything you know could apply to could apply to Fitness it's like look if you do really intense kettle bell swings twice a week with proper weight and load and time under tension and you do push-ups a few times a week and handle a couple of other elements you can get in pretty good shape it's so simple but hits a lot I mean hits your entire posterior chain okay fine do some push-ups and some core work but if you're not exercising at all because you've made the assumption that it's four hours five hours a week rather than completely remove that objective and call it just impractical can you ratchet down the scale how far can you ratchet down the scale until you have no excuses right that would just be one one example language learning Tech investing applies to everything making life easier is something that definitely gets my vote yeah making it easier and making it more elegant right the more pieces in your life you have floating around the more contacts the more extraneous loose connections the harder your life is going to be the cognitive overload or overhead is really high so I'm always looking for maybe like Japanese a flower arranging it's like okay how how many pieces can I remove while still like maintaining the essence of what I'm trying to achieve you and Rick Ruben man I'm telling you you know two people I am fortunate enough to know personally and that I have tremendous respect for and you know the work and uh is self-evident you know it's really remarkable so uh rewind that and listen to that segment right there folks I'm telling you I've worked hard to apply it because it's not my default and boy does it make a significant Improvement to simplify simplify simplify take some thought and question asking it's like you just can't delete things at random so you get down to some fixed number but um I'd like to ask you about another area where you really have seemed to see around corners and this is one that actually carried with it significant risk um not necessarily risk to health and to life but risk in terms of outside perceptions and that's psychedelics MH you know I've substantially changed my view on this uh we don't need to go into my former stance on I talked about that when you were gracious enough to host me on your podcast for a second time uh done some psychedelics recreationally as a kid it was correlated with um not so great times in my life stayed away from them then eventually Revisited MDMA in particular from a therapeutic standpoint found tremendous benefit again therapeutically with a medical doctor again these drugs are illegal uh soon to change perhaps hopefully and we'll talk about that but uh it's becoming clear from the controlled Studies by Robin Carter Harris uh there are many others okay Nolan Williams others um that these drugs have enormous potential to help relieve depression trauma uh help people explore their psyche their mind for sake of feeling better doing better in the world for leaning into life not tune in drop out but um you know to really lean into life with more purpose and more satisfaction in some cases they've really have saved lives I think um what was your mindset around psychedelics when you first started exploring them what led you to overcome the inevitable you know fear Gap there uh because you do seem like somebody who takes value in your health right you're not Wreckless you may have been more adventurous in the past with things like I hate the word but biohacking and self experimentation than you are now but but you obviously have some self-preservation mechanism intact we learn we learn we learn um what was your mindset around it at the time and then I want to get to what you've learned from it um and frankly the tremendous efforts that you've put that are now translating to tremendous value for really millions of people and ultimately I think it's going to be billions of people um by establishing funding for the pioneering research in this area helping to promote the movement of these compounds from illegal to legal in the therapeutic setting so on and so on so take us back to um your first thoughtful exploration of psychedelics what would that look like you're like oh mushrooms all eat them was that it or was it um or or was it a a dedicated uh research process and who' you talk to what was it all about so let's go way back to my grad experience and there were many reasons that I ended up going to Princeton I think I was very lucky to get in my SAT scores because I could never finish the damn test I was so much of a perfectionist I get stuck and ended up not doing terribly well but through S and other things ultimately was able to go part of the draw let me interrupt you and just say I think at this point we can say they were lucky to have you well thank you for saying that thank you for saying that great institution and you've done great and you're a a a great um poster on the wall for them yeah really really really yeah I just want to say it because you're not going to and I think it's important that these are great institutions have great minds go through there and you know Einstein went through there and uh and their success rests not just on the Einstein but also on the student body and what they go out into the world and do and not just in the realm of science so really they're they're lucky to have had you yeah thank you Andrew I studied Chinese in a room where Einstein used to teach it's pretty cool t set foot and spend time weekly in a space that was shared by some of these people amazing it really it really gets the imagination firing if we go back to that chapter in my life I was initially a Psychology major with focus on Neuroscience so I want to be a neuroscientist and there are many reasons for that I have neurodegenerative disease on both sides of my family so Parkinson's and Alzheimer's so that was certainly a personal driving interest in terms of looking at mechanisms understanding what Therapeutics existed or did not exist how things were developing in the research and while I was there which later I ended up uh Switching gears and transferring to focus on language acquisition and East Asian studies hence the Chinese that I mentioned earlier and Japanese and Korean but on the Neuroscience side there were a lot of cool breakthroughs also that came out of uh Princeton around that time looking at the amazing discovery of say uh neuronal uh I want to say Regenesis but neurogenesis in the hippocampus remember exactly exactly so there was quite a bit happening at that time I was a subject I loved volunteering for studies just to try to get an inside look at how things were done in some of Daniel Conan's experiments so it was a cool time to be there and within the first two years I want to say I had my first experience recreationally with mushrooms and looking back now I mean I'm horrified by just the lack of control and meaning not control but lack of supervision right I mean the setting the set and setting ended up being fine nothing terrible happened but there were a lot of ways it could have gone sideways but that first experience and I must have consumed in retrospect just a dizzying amount of mushrooms I mean be in excess of five gram it would have been more yeah just knowing what I know now it would have been kids don't do this at all don't do that I'm not I'm not gonna say don't do it at home don't do it at all yeah yeah please I don't think I actually don't think uh the young developing brain should be exposed to psychedelics we could talk about we could talk about that I'm GNA to take my stance I'm gonna take my stance for now yeah I mean in in the world in which we live in the US um I would I would totally agree with you um there are some interesting cultural exceptions in other places uh where there things are more set up to provide for that type of use but I certainly would not recommend it but but coming back to my my recreational experience my my subjective experience was so bizarre and my experience of time so nonlinear my experience of self so different from anything I had experienced up to that point and therefore my construction of reality being so completely unlike anything I had experienced was enough to make me want to learn about these compounds and very early on I still have a scan of it somewhere I think it was in 1998 or 99 I actually wrote a paper one of my junior papers was focused on examining potential similarities between RM sleep and uh LSD MH lsd2 uh and looking at some of the patterns of of neural activity of course we can do a lot more now with with the tools that we have available but from a scientific perspective I was very curious about how much we knew and how much we didn't know and I would say that latter category gets me more excited in a way I'm like okay how how much room is there for growth here right because if if we're just putting on the finishing touches with marginal you know incremental improvements on something that we feel like we've largely figured out that's less interesting to me than something that baffles most people examining them on some level and there was a professor named Barry Jacobs who was doing some very interesting work he did a lot of work looking at the Ser energic systems and uh did a lot of work with cats ultimately I could not do personally the animal work required of the sort of indentured servitude that I would I think you wrote someplace once you know you you said you know when confronted with the uh the prospect of um installing a a a computer printer into the head of ACK on the back of a cat head they they Lally had those like those little VGA ports on the back of these cats heads because cats sleep a lot and so they're interesting study a lot that cats very few Laboratories work on cats any longer it's mostly a mouse still some non-human primate work my lab is essentially shut down um or is in the process of shutting down even our Mouse work I much prefer to work on humans they can give consent and they house themselves and um the animal research thing is tough for any for any sentient being yeah it's it's tough the cat for what it's worth the cats seem pretty happy like they were just sleeping I mean the the ports were for tracking so the cats were pretty I mean they were just normal cats the cats were fine but I would have been we would have been injecting retroviruses into rats and then perfusing them which means bleeding them to death uh to avoid bruising of the tissue because then if you're going to take thin slices and scans you didn't want to have bruising and I just couldn't I just couldn't do it I think it's important I do think I do think there's a place for it but I couldn't do it so that's why I transferred out but the the point I was trying to make is that I had the experience and then I had that drive the scientific interest and then I had probably one experience per year for a few years after that and what I noticed for myself personally because I've suffered from major depressive disorder and extended depre depressive episodes let's just say on average three to four a year and by by extended even before you had started even before from from a young age yeah from a very young age and I would say so let's just call it three to four on average a year those could last each a few weeks or a few months I mean this is this is a a very high percentage of my total year and when I had these higher dose experiences with with mushrooms so we're talking about COC mushrooms and then if we're looking at the molecule that's being examined scientifically psilocybon I noticed this Afterglow effect that was really durable and that was an anti-depressant effect or a mood elevating effect that lasted far longer than the halflife could explain right because four to 6 hours you're you're you're kind of on the other side and I would experience this this Afterglow effect for 3 to six months and that raised all sorts of interesting questions what the hell is going on here is it the content is it some structural change there were a lot of unanswered questions for me and then I had a very very scary experience that led me to completely stop use of psychedelics where again uncontrolled environment ended up in rural uh in rural New York York coming out of my trip standing in the middle of the road in the middle of the night with headlights coming at me goodness gracious so you don't want to do that yeah and I was like okay too dangerous were you taking them alone is that how that is I was taking them with two friends and my two friends without telling me just went for a walk and left me alone points to the you know I mean there're these are powerful compounds yeah you're you're you're playing with nuclear power like these these are the this is the nuclear power of like psychological or uh psychoemotional surgery is is the way I encourage people to think about them and I stopped using any psychedelics completely I was still very interested in them and but I basically hit pause and I didn't revisit that until let's call it 2012 2013 where I was still struggling with major depressive disorder and I saw my girlfriend at the time completely transformed by supervised facilitated use of in this case iasa which uh was not quite as common as it is in conversation at the time and she did that in South America but she not only explained her experience but I was able to see the transformation in her that seemed to have some durability over time and that is when I started stepping back into researching psychedelics looking at what had been published in the last let's just call it 10 years uh as of that point in time and thinking about how I would approach it systematically with safeguards with proper supervision basically approaching it the way I would have approached any of the topics in the 4our body and that is what led me back into along with a number of other interventions I should say so I wasn't betting the farm on psychedelics I also started teach at that point I was I was just some people might uh trans uh transcendal these are like 4 to 10 day meditation Retreats this was actually much shorter it was a two or three day training and you're visiting the instructor I want to say it's once or twice a day probably once a day and getting up to speed and I did this because I was going through an a period of acute stress this is finishing the 4our chef this is actually probably in the Years preceding that and I had one friend who I'd seen really change from let's just call hyper kinetic high anxiety to low anxiety and he said you have the time you have the money pay for the course just take it yes there are all these criticisms of TM yes there are all these weird historical anecdotes of people trying to levitate and all this weirdness just ignore that I'm trying to levitate nothing against that if you actually levitate then we got to have a discussion but trying to levitate seems like why you know every kid every kid tries all sorts of things give it a go uh he's like just put that aside because I I kept coming up with push back and he's like look all I'm saying is it's like a warm bath for your mind that you take twice a day and it'll chill you the out so try it and I was like okay fine it's a good endorsement I was like I was like at this point I was i' had been burning the candle at both ends so intensely it's like okay so there was TM and then I began examining how I might approach notice I didn't just jump into using them I was like how could I approach taking adelic in a sequence in a logical sequence with proper protections with safety assurances and that took me probably a month or two and I was right in the middle of things in Northern California you have access to a lot and only then did I start looking at having my own experiences and lo and behold I mean I'll I'll cut to the chase but the the personal outcome and there there are many different benefits uh and risks I should make very clear these things can be extremely dangerous in certain ways generally not physiologically but they can be dangerous I would say instead of three to four times per year on average I probably have one depressive episode every two years that's a significant Improvement yeah right I mean from a quality of life perspective those are two different people and uh that then led me to and I as I did with all my workouts right I took copious notes over the span I mean now we're looking at 10 plus years uh so if I were to ever write another book uh it would probably be related to all of the really fine details of the experiments and my learnings including some of the more Biz bizarre things over the last 10 years but it would be a it would be just a beast to create so with with psychedelics experiences with psychedelics psychedelics and sort of psychedelic adjacent uh non-ordinary experiences of Consciousness uh which I think often are touching at edges of the same thing uh which which is going to be controversial for some folks but to to come back to the storyline just to put a bow on that when I saw the personal outcomes for me the anic data from friends who are facilitators who have worked with thousands of people right which is a pretty good sample size still anecdote but these are people who are very smart who keep records and I I believe that these people have spotted patterns that are only going to be possible to test and verify over the next 5 to 10 years so I at least as a as a means of generating hypothesis I take these people very seriously uh and then I started to connect with Scientists whose work I had read like Roland Griffith and John's Hopkins began looking at the most compelling data related to say MDMA assistant Psychotherapy and complex PTSD I I made the commitment to myself that as soon as I had enough money to move the dial because I really felt like these tools were so outside of the normal Paradigm of Psychiatry and pharmacology and that made me very excited because it was uncrowded there's very little funding coming into the space it was high leverage and I looked at it just as I've looked at my many startup Investments uh limited downside risk really high upside potential and I should say before that I had already been funding in a very small way science so the first check I ever wrote was personally to Adam gazali's Lab at UCSF yeah great lab which at the time was looking at soft Ware he's not going to like this description but I'm going to simplify it software that might attenuate or reverse age related cognitive impairment uh spe specifically related to various aspects of of attention and that was my first for into funding early stage science which was very analogous to me of uh to to funding early stage startups and then later on to touch on the reputational thing I know this is a TED talk so thank you for listening no this is great please please you're always so gracious on your podcast this is what people want this is certainly what I want to hear so so on the reputational side you're right that at the time especially let's just call it 2013 to 2015 this was not a na a comfortable National conversation of any type yeah I wouldn't have had this conversation back then no way I'd lose I I don't know that I would have lost my job it just would have raised a lot of eyebrows now that such studies are happening at Stanford the perception yeah the perception was these are a professional third rail at the very least right also illegal therefore if I talk about them am I giving someone probable cause am I going to get myself in some type of really tricky legal situation Etc there are a lot of considerations but I tested that just like I was saying I like to capture my assumptions on paper so I can stress this I was like okay I think that might be true most people I know think that is true but is it true how could we test to see if that is true or not and I decided to crowdfund for a Hopkins pilot study looking at psilocybin for treatment resistant depression and I thought to myself okay we have we have a couple of couple of things falling in our favor here number one depression does not discriminate so cross soio economic classes across gender across race this is a problem almost everyone knows someone who takes anti-depressants who is still depressed okay treatment resistant depression therefore is the indication siloc cybin is the intervention let me crowdfund and I did that throughout the time crowd rise which was co-founded by Edward Norton who had become a friend and was the actor Ed who's very smart very very very smart also one of the best investors I've ever met which a lot of people don't know very bright guy and so crowd funded and I also like to put my uh money where my mouth is so I said okay guys I'm going to seed this like I'm putting in X the goal is to raise I think it was 880,000 something like that for the following study and then I was like let's see let's see what happens and there was basically zero negative blowback and Not only was was there no discernable negative blowback a number of people and this was deliberate I wanted to see this a number of people came came out of the woodwork to support in a bigger way and I was like oh okay I see you bunch a handful of folks I knew and I was like oh interesting okay there are at least a half a dozen folks who are studying the same thing or paying attention to the same thing and then I just got Boulder I was like okay if I tested that let me push and then let's see what happens and I'll wait and lo and behold I realized that the perception did not match the reality the reality was if you're talking about IND indications that cause an incredible amount of suffering for a very large number of people even those who are anti-drug per se just say no to drugs want Solutions and the current treatments for many of these things do not work very well and in the best of cases are often masking symptoms and not addressing root causes I would say so at that point I just went whole hog and I said okay look I like to think that I am a exactly what you see is what you get right the person you talk to off camera person you talk to on camera same and if I start feeling like I have too much to protect I want to do something to counteract that in other words if if if I feel like I need to censor my true feelings and beliefs maybe not share my hardships perhaps not promote certain things because I have a reputation to lose that's a fragile position I want to be as antifragile as possible and so by talking about this I viewed it as a way of inoculating myself against fear of reputation loss like okay let me push this like I'll ride this horse other people might not but I wanted to remove the stigma for funding purposes hopefully open up federal funding that's starting to happen now from different agencies and then to focus on access and reduction of cost and insurance reimbursement and so on so I set a game plan let's call it maybe five years ago and I've just been slowly methodically executing on that since and uh the reason I chose this to focus on and I've funded other things but I've really focused on this mental health Therapeutics which is not limited to psychedelics we could talk about some other things that I find interesting but psychedelics are like I said what makes it attractive very uncrowded you can do a lot with a small amount of money unlike saying cancer research can be very hard like okay you're Deca billionaire great maybe you can do something interesting and I'm sure other people could but if you have 20,000 $50,000 it's going to be hard to make a dent there in psychedelics you can actually still make a difference and very high leverage in part because these compounds seem to challenge much of what we assume to be true about treating mental health and uh so that's uh that makes for an attractive bet so that's where I've been been going yeah I'm so glad you shared that with with us and that you did that exploration um and that you've been spearheading the funding efforts uh you know this podcast has a um a premium channel that's for raising funds for scientific studies we are in the process now making our first four uh contributions one of those includes uh work in Nolan Williams laboratory at Stanford combining trans cranial magnetic stimulation with um studies of ibigan and uh 5 Meo DMT maybe a few other things but basically that he's free to do what he wants with the funds we trust him to do great work but that again was inspired by you right uh podcast with a scientific um slant certainly um this podcast obviously has a scientific slant but the idea of doing philanthropy for the sorts of work that uh really deserves funding and exploration and um by the way um and thinking about other hybrid things that would be fun to do I mean I would love to uh contribute and join those efforts that you cu the work to continue to raise funding for psychedelic studies and all these great Laboratories continues right it continues and you've rallied a collection of um some pretty uh powerful people to contribute to this and I know you've joined arms with Michael pollen in many ways do you want to talk about the fellowships that you guys put together I find that really cool you you've got fellowships uh in the works or maybe already happening at UC Berkeley is that right at UC Berkeley yeah so the what what I try to do and for people who want to check it out it's it's the name of the foundation is Cay foundation and let me explain that for a second so it's S A II so Cay foundation.org I speak Japanese I went there as an exchange student and speak read and write it still to this day pretty well sa can mean a lot of things it means rebirth in Japanese and I've seen what can only be described or can certainly be described as rebirth and so many clinical outcomes that I thought it was appropriate to use and what I've tried to do with the foundation is I think do what I'm pretty good at which is trying to peek around corners and find something to prototype right so just like the CGM and like all right how can I just getting a hold of a Dexcom back then when it was just for type 1 diabetics was was hard it was is the thing that you have to actually go under the skin so it's like taking a barbecue prong and putting it under your ab abdominal skin it was not comfortable can you describe your um cortisol level and uh subjective terms when you're at home you got this thing and you're about to implant it and you don't have any precent it's not like this is you know like levels or one of these other uh cgms that are out there you know stamp the thing in you can look on Instagram and see someone else do it there's nothing like that so you're at home wondering if you're going to skew your liver yeah I I'm I'm at home doing it myself and I'm sweating like a stuck pig I'm sitting there I'm like my God I don't even know if I can hold is your girlfriend there like to support you in case you I think at the time wasn't because she was squeamish and didn't want to see it and I'm so I'm sitting there at my kitchen table I remember this God I'm sweating just thinking about it and no videos to watch and uh wasn't really supposed to have it in the first place and uh the device for readout by the way no iPhone right so it's like this janky pager looking thing that had a readout that made you think you were playing pong or something I mean it was very the green the green tint screen yeah green tin screen do font it was so primitive and uh put this thing under my skin would tape uh I would cut a Ziploc bag and put it on top and and masking tape it to my skin to take showers because otherwise it wouldn't work and it was it was great and I'll just say that I don't use a c it was great you realize you said it was great I did I did say it was great because sweating and it was I was afraid but it gave me a lot of insight okay and uh then once I had the Insight over a course of a handful of weeks then I felt like I didn't really need it anymore and that was also just a a heavy tax to pay to have to wear that thing around look like you have a you know what is it called a colostomy bag or something it just like it was big it was bulky um so just like I did that I wanted to do proof of concept right the goal was can I use this for healthy normal applications will the insights be actionable and they were lo and behold similarly with the foundation since I'm dealing with smaller amounts of money you know I'm not uh in the billionaire club by any stretch of the imagination and science can be expensive I'm looking for small bets where can I pilot something that if successful will be emulated or can be scaled and so and say the crowdfunding for for the Hopkins treatment resistant depression pilot study we ended up exceeding the goal they were able to recruit more subjects in the case of UC Berkeley Michael poen and I partnered on this and my Foundation funded it the ferris UC Berkeley journalism Fellowship psychedelic journalism Fellowship is providing funding to up-and-coming journalists who want to focus on psychedelics as their beat which to this date has not been financially feasible you just don't have the space to do really long for investig investigative work the Hope being that these journalists can apply their skills and their dedication to examining different facets of the Psychedelic ecosystem therapeutic potential uh regulatory issues ETC in a way that can shape and inform National and international discourse in a in a very critical way because these things are not a Panacea there's a lot of claims that are made about these that are totally unbacked by any type of Science and there're a lot of charlatans and so I want wanted to also invite really competent really good journalists to the table who might want to watch for Bad actors I think that's really important and so this Fellowship has been been uh has been awarding fellows with these grants and I think it's a relatively small amount of money it's like $10,000 per something like that but the outcomes have been amazing we had a huge I want to say was 7,000 word piece that was one of the main features in Rolling Stone magazine huge piece in National Geographic focused on iboga and fair trade and some of the implications for uh local harvesting and or over harvesting all the Dynamics present in that which I think has some incredible promise for particular forms of um opioid use opioid use disorder in particular but uh that has been a huge success so the hope is that other journalism schools will say that's a great idea and I will have DER risked it for some other philanthropist or Foundation or government say director at an agency to say okay well green like that right because I've done it and it's been received very well and it's had a real impact on how things are moving along another one would be say at Harvard popper this is at Harvard Law School was the first is the first dedicated team focused on law policy and regulation related to psychedelics from a legal perspective super important super important super super important also another pilot let's just call it uh proof of concept that Cay Foundation funded was helping to develop curricula for I think it was Yale John's Hopkins and NYU effectively an creditation or module that they could put into their existing Psychiatry MD uh programs such that people could develop the skills necessary and the understanding necessary to administer psychedelic assist therapies if and when they become legal prescribable which it if I understand correctly it sounds like within the next 12 to 24 months MDMA assisted Psychotherapy for the treatment of trauma is is likely to become legal in the hands of uh psychiatrists at least and maybe certain clinical psychologists as well in the US is that right through the M through the efforts of the maps group yeah through through the efforts of maps.org and Rick doblin and many others that is the tip of the spear so I think anyone who's interested in psychedelics should have a vested interest in supporting those efforts not because we know everything works I want to be clear not because we know a priori that all these things do all the things no but if if MDMA fails it's going to be very hard to draft it'll be impossible to draft on that with commands that are more difficult to administer like psilocybin which would be next in line for alcohol use disorder also major depressive disorder so I I I really feel that just like everything I've talked about whether it's networking putting together the 4our body or trying to change National policy and say uh uh reclassification of these compounds getting them out of schedule one to some extent you want to break it down into its constituent pieces you want to do an 8020 analysis figure out what the critical few are and then put them in a logical sequence and execute the plan one of the greatest weaknesses in the Psychedelic ecosystem is there are a lot of people who just want to do all the things and save all the people and the animals and all the places all at once and that just doesn't work very well there are also some really good people who are executing um and we could talk about the for-profit side and so on but uh I've been very very very pleased with the outcomes that Cay Foundation has been able to achieve with very limited money I'm prouder of those outcomes than I am of the startup record and the startup record is pretty good um and it's the same lens I'm using the same the same filters and the same approach which uh which is kind of what I'm always looking for I'm looking for stuff that'll translate across Fields if possible and then you mentioned one like TMS I think TMS very interesting transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah which at one point was um more commonly used to inhibit specific brain areas this is a non-invasive technique uh I've had it done where it's over my motor cortex and you're tapping your finger and all of a sudden you can't tap your fingers it's pretty eer but now it can be used to stimulate at particular frequencies enhance neuroplasticity and and in combin with psychedelics is the that's kind of the burning question now can you get a uh a synergistic effect of TMS and and uh psychedelic maybe um not just during the the psilocybin or uh iboga Journey but in the days and weeks after when we know for sure a lot of plasticity is still occurring so keep the plasticity on board or accelerate it yeah yeah so T TMS uh also is a monotherapy very interesting to me for depression anxiety even substance use disorders super interesting and there are many different protocols all sorts of different technology uh I would say low intensity or low power ultrasound also super interesting uh for various various applications potentially to addiction so I'm not to be clear a card carrying evangelist for psychedelics I am a proponent of looking for high leverage on crowded Bets with limited downside and testing them out and very optimistic about psychedelics if anyone listening has a family history of say schizophrenia borderline personality disorder uh which we might which this is being very simplistic but categorize or describe as more chaotic conditions compared to hyper rigid conditions like an OCD or anorexia nervosa uh chronic depression Etc and we can talk about why some of these psychedelics at least some of the classical psychedelics seem to have cross efficacy with multiple conditions but psychedelics seem very helpful for certain types of hyper rigidity when you get into schizophrenia borderline personality disorder they can be really heavily contraindicated not to say that they cause those cons those conditions but they can precipitate the onset of those symptoms and for that reason can be very destabilizing and dangerous for for certain people however that's where something like metabolic Psychiatry comes in and the use of ketosis and the ketogenic diet which appears to be very effective in some patients for that grouping of say more chaotic conditions which is very exciting so I'm interested in in in any tools that are off the beaten path that seem to raise interesting questions that have not been answered in a satisfying way yet in medicine uh and I think we're still largely in the Dark Ages with respect to Psychiatry oh I think um the best psychiatrists would agree with you yeah and and the best psychiatrists uh and the best scientists and the best fill inth the blank are acutely aware of the limitations of our current methods and the limitations of our current knowledge uh so I think the mark of a good thinker the mark of a good scientist the mark of a good fill-in theblank anything is someone who says I'd have no idea or we have no idea a lot and hopefully they also say let's go figure it out or try some things and I I I really want to thank you for sharing um that narrative especially because it makes clear that you brought the same systematic process of using and asking excellent questions to arrive at Solutions to arrive at more questions to fund areas of inquiry and to do it all in this really structured way as you said from policy all the way down to like how many grams or uh you know X of of some substance somebody might take I mean I think Matthew Johnson's laboratory at Hopkins uh Roland Griffith uh Robin cardart Harris at UCSF uh Nolan Williams the maps group Rick doblin Peter Hendrick at University of Alabama looking at cocaine addiction things yeah you Michael pollen um you know I'm leaving some names out here and I don't want to take anything away from the um classic uh as they're called um explorers of psychedelics and and writers about psychedelics but we are in the moment of a Renaissance now and it's important that this have a lot of uh fuel so we'll put a link to um your philanthropy efforts and and the journalism uh fellowships as well because I think there's going to be a lot of interest there and I'm huge supporter of what you're doing as as you know and I just think it's the way great science and clinical progress is made so you um thanks Andrew yeah it's which brings me to another parallel topic you know it used to be that meditation and psychedelics were have nested in the same territory this would be in the late 60s early 70s the birth of places like esselin Etc or the consequence of the Dual exploration of those things meditation sort of escaped from the psychedelics umbrella and vice versa um starting sometime in the you know mid 2000s when neuroimaging became a little bit more accessible and you know I think nowadays if you told anybody okay um you know meditation is good for you it can help uh ratchet down your anxiety give more self-awareness um you know improve sleep and on and on maybe even give some insight into Consciousness no one's going to bulk there just a lot of studies there are thousands of studies um my laboratory's done a few of them there are other Laboratories who have done uh far more the book altered traits is the one that comes to mind group out of Wisconsin was early to early to the game on this um in any event you talked about TM um I'm curious from a practical standpoint do you still meditate daily do you do meditation Retreats um what sorts of meditative practices do you have because I realize this can be done walking writing as its own form of meditation what sorts of formal practices do you still engage in now yeah I do 10 to 20 minutes in the morning so I am not currently doing the TM twice daily 20 minutes I think that would be better for me probably do you set a clock and you or yeah I'll set a clock uh which would be more of the concentration practice of say a TM where you're repeating a mantra honestly it could be any in my opinion some TM purists will bulk at this but uh it could be really any nonsense syllable could be a word although I think something without any attached meaning is probably more beneficial for a host of reasons so con could be a concentration practice with 20 minutes of sitting it might also be a guided meditation and I have no vested interest in this app but I think the waking up app by Sam Harris is fantastic I have do I I have used the introductory course which is Sam leading you through my catnip which is a logical progression of skill development from day one to three and and forward I have gone through that course multiple times when I'm getting back on the horse for meditation as a bit of a reboot once you develop I think a certain degree of awareness and mindfulness I do think there are other activities that probably allow you the parallel experience of doing one thing while experiencing some of the benefits of meditation and so for me I wonder at times are the benefits of meditation the concentration practice itself is it just sitting still with my eyes clo closed downregulating my system a little bit activating my Paras sympath atic and not rushing or doing anything for 20 minutes is that it maybe is it simply correcting my posture for 20 minutes how do I wait these different inputs and the the short answer is you probably don't need to know but I have found that spending time in silence in nature without anything to do disallowing myself from doing things no note take no reading Etc and spending I I have spent a number of extended fasts in nature just like water only by myself no talking no reading no writing what's extended seven days generally wow so you're camping in nature MH with just water yep that's it by myself and there are risks associated with that right you gotta be careful not stupid about it but uh that does a lot for me with some persistent benefits are there some favorite places that you've gone uh into nature it doesn't have to be to fast like for instance I'm a big fan of um some of the national parks up in the Pacific Northwest because it's like being transported to a different planet Y is obviously amazing but any favorite spots um where we won't go people won't go looking for you there don't worry yeah I you live in Austin all the time so they right yeah so I would say uh Colorado Utah New Mexico spending time in mountains around River rivers lakes I find very therapeutic and just gorgeous I I I do think we suffer from uh awe deficiency disorder you know a bit of add when we're trapped in the mundane for too long with too much distraction with too many to-dos with too many relationships and there's no space for a there there isn't the room necessary a isn't from my perspective generally a quick hit that you get in the 30 seconds between using two apps there's there's more Breathing Room required for a genuine Transcendent experience of awe so I try to on a yearly basis as one of my top priorities block out these weeks of time in nature yeah last year was the first year I did that I went out to Colorado um in August and just took daily hikes I stayed in a hotel was I'm not as beasty as you doing water fast I was eating every day but um it was spect acular one thing I noticed and I'd like to know your process on how do you handle going back into life um great question you know because those days were and are amazing right you like detached and you know maybe one text message here or there in between hikes or something and then you just really clued in even the the process of watching a show at night like one felt so rich and like enough so I wasn't um as aesthetic as you were and uh like really cleaned all the Clutter but once you return to life mhm it's almost like get being a wash in demands and and I can see from a place of more Equanimity how one could make better choices but how do you handle those transitions the re-entry yeah so before getting to the re-entry I think it might make sense for me to talk about what comes before so let's say it's like pre during post part of the reason I do these one week or longer periods Off the Grid is because it forces me to put better systems in place so there's the benefit that you derive from say that week and I have three weeks coming up right after this interview where I'm going to be off the grid to set myself up for three weeks off the grid I have a team I have the podcast I have a lot of things that are in motion at any given point in time if you disappear for say a two to 4-we period generally you cannot let the whole house catch on fire then come back and put it out effectively which means you need put some policies and rules and so on in place in advance and there's a carryover effect that has a host of benefits and makes things smoother for the re-entry so they're related like the more you set up the pre the easier the post is going to be and then you have this beautiful expansive experience in nature whatever it might be whether you're making it a sufferfest like I do or at a hotel at night either way these things can work and nature in and of itself is super helpful I do think that a lot of the time we like to imagine because we're driven smart accomplished people that our problems are very complex and at the end of the day it's like you just need some time in nature and a cold shower and some macadamia nuts and you'll be fine you don't need to solve like all the existential dilemmas of humankind actually or fancy Pharmaceuticals so you have this experience over this week and what I will do then is set at least a let's call it integration period of two to three days where I will slowly Edge back in to my previous routine I will not within 12 hours of getting back to so-called civilization have a day full of calls or meetings I will not do that it's too much of a shock to the system and I think it robs you of a tail end of benefits which would also be the case with say fast or ketogenic diet or any number of interventions you can squeeze out a longtail of benefits if you make a handful of changes for instance after an extended fast what if you started with a subc caloric ketogenic diet for a few days you get to extend some of the benefits as opposed to going straight back to say a diet that includes a lot of carbohydrates similarly when you create more of a vacuum more space for awe Insight reflection recovery I I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you jump from park into sixth gear and so I plan for that and it's a function of scheduling I also have a predictable weekly schedule so I tend to schedule podcast recordings on Mondays and Fridays in preparation for an extended trip I will batch a lot of similar activities that we have say a bunch of episodes in the bank that are prescheduled everything is figured out in advance and over time the more you take these breaks the better your systems become and the more liberated you are from the day-to-day which means when you get back you also don't need to rush as much into hyperactivity and if you do you know that that is more from a compulsivity than from a necessity while you on these nature Retreats are you writing on a daily basis are you just thinking and allowing thoughts to enter and leave your system depends on the retreat so sometimes I'm writing but writing I think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive and I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time so there are many areas in my life now so if you were to ask me like what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote for our body I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize I am looking where I can very deliberately de optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being where can I de optimize where can I stop measuring where can I stop reading books which areas can I ignore completely what types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time delete Twitter stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be like where can I de optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole does that make sense makes good sense yeah and before we started recording I gave you a book which is a short collection of poetry by uh haliza Gori which is called gold it's a collection of roomy poetry reading poetry is an activity almost by definition which is is the antithesis of optimization so I've tried to also integrate more of those activities into my life and this relates to your question because there are times when I will just force myself to sit on my goddamn hands and not write not read just do the thing that is so uncomfortable sometimes which is just sitting there with yourself you know it can be incredibly uncomfortable and in part because of the fear that it could become comfortable yeah right especially for proactive people with a yeah strong to use Paul K's words generative drive you know you're going to that's a uh you know the which is a good thing uh I believe it's a good thing and it it can be a good thing it can indicate really incredible adaptations it can also sometimes I think indicate Mal adaptations right and so I think it's it's helpful to take a break from that generative drive or at least just put it in park position to see if that generative Drive is is perhaps indicative of you leaning towards something in a healthy proactive way versus running from something in a long-term destructive way yeah well and I think Paul would say that part of the generative Drive process is um Peace you know not as necessarily even as a still state but as a um you know being able to experience peace even in the Transitions and there's a lot more to say about that and would say it far better than I ever would so I'll uh leave it at that and um I mean for people who have the option getting in nature it doesn't have to be all day every day on a water fast I just take certain things to an extreme because that's who I am but sorry when you say water fast that means fasting with water right it just fasting but yes drinking water it just means you're allowed to have water and nothing else for for a long time I thought it meant that you're not drinking water oh yeah no don't do that some people do that right they do these crazy food water fasts um as a weight I think they believe it clears senent cells or something but um probably clears a lot more than just cocin cells yeah I uh there might be something to it I mean look there are people who recycle by drinking their own urine not my jam uh but I would say it's like three hours without shelter three days without water three weeks without food general rule of thumb so be careful with dehydration you can go a long time without food if you have I don't care how ripped you are you get 8% body fat man you got plenty of time you can go couple weeks no problem you got calories St 9000 calories per pound stored body fat you got plenty don't worry uh so for people who have the option to be in nature and just exercise several hours a day to exhaustion see how many of your problems seem to just go away just try that yeah well my Sunday routine uh is to try and get outside and move as much as possible yeah I don't always succeed but um I'm going to try a longer retreat into nature I think um Olympic National Forest is is calling me again it seems like once a year I just want to get back up there it's uh it's calling you you you should get back out there it's spectacular I have a question about mentors I'm a big believer in mentors either uh mentors that know us and we know them or U people that we assign as mentors without them realizing it um this sort of thing uh do you have mentors at this stage of life um for particular areas of life are you uh you mentoring yourself are you flying with um a few voices in your head uh that serve you well who are your mentors I definitely have people I consider mentors it's I think at this point rarely one way in the sense that they tend to be friends I spend time with they get something from it I get something from it not in a transactional way but they find it fun or beneficial or amusing in some way redeeming to spend time with me that's the hope but how is that different from like traditional friendship you know just sort of standard friendship are you focus are you spending time with some orientation toward like their embodying areas of life that you would like to emulate totally I mean I spend I spend time around people I hope to be more like in some way because guess what you're going to average into say the the just the the sum holistic ho of the five or six people you spend the most time with so you should choose that very carefully that includes virtual parasocial relationships like okay if you're listening to fill in- the blank person for four hours a week five hours a week two hours a week whoever that group is comprised of is going to influence who you become come and for me then I think carefully about my friendships and they could be older like a Kevin Kelly who's become a good friend who has a wealth of life experience that I don't have and so I might just call him and say Kevin I have question for you but I do that with my younger friends too and they could be younger than I am and I might still view them as a mentor in xwi Z I think Mentor has a heavy weight to it it has a connotation of maybe NeverEnding time consuming obligation so I I would never for instance and I know a lot of people try this ask someone to be my mentor it's like would you like to be my free life coach forever you know it's like that's kind of how it sounds to the recipient it it sounds very formal yeah it sounds very formal and so for me I would say there have certainly been mentors I've had wrestling coaches I've had teachers I've had resident advisor who were reverence who had a huge impact on my life and followed up with me and paid attention to me and cared for me in more of a one directional sense right I I view myself as the beneficiary of course they they certainly got something out of it if they had that job I they probably found it to be very gratifying in its own way and teachers like Professor Ed sha at Princeton I feel in incredibly indebted to these days and for a long time I've believed that you can learn something powerful from almost anyone probably anyone you interact with could be an Uber driver could be someone taking garbage out of a restaurant if you really take the time to dig you can find something and before you can I think as an adult effectively think about who you would like to learn from if I put it that way it's helpful to have a baseline of self-awareness that you know what you might want to work on to either amplify strengths develop skills address weaknesses and so for instance one of my close friends Matt mullenweg is younger than I am he's the he's the founder of automatic which runs wordpress.com he was the leite developer of Wordpress although was an open source project of course with many many contributors he was one of the lead developers Now power something like 32% of the internet and he exemplifies a cool and calm temperament even in the most chaotic periods imaginable during the most chaotic events imaginable and when I find myself getting disregulated to use a fancy term losing my or getting carried away by emotion getting righteously angry or whatever it might be and I recognize at some some point that it's really not serving me that I am being owned by the emotion right like I'm the dog on the leash not the other way around then I think of Matt I'm like what would Matt do what advice would Matt give me right now how would Matt act in these circumstances and I do that with with with many friends I also think a lot about and this is borrowing from someone named Kathy Sierra a long time ago focusing more on just in time information as opposed to just in case information so just in case information is like I'm going to read these 20 books because in two years I might be interested in X Y and Z that I think is often a waste of time because if it ever becomes relevant you're just going to have to reread those books people do the same thing with humans they're like I want to meet so and so and have them as my mentor because maybe five years from now I'll do X Y and Z and then they'll be useful for ABC that's too speculative and I think it ends up in a lot of wasted energy so the podcast for me writing the books and doing the interviews even prior to the podcast becoming involved with startups delving into the world of science and scientists all helps me to develop a confidence that almost any question I could ask I can find some semblance of an answer for by just reaching out to a few people and saying who do you know who might be able to answer this and that's very reassuring and it it relieves some of the anxiety or pressure that people might feel to assemble some personal board of directors of like X-Men and women who can help them with everything uh and and then there are people I hire to be accountable to right so I might work with coaches therapists and so on who I would view as they just Happ to get getting paid for it right yeah the reason I asked the question is because we were talking about the meditative process going into nature and even with psychedelics there you know they can be viewed a lot of different ways but I think of them largely as going inward to explore I mean you're out in nature and learning from nature um there's such a core truth to Nature I know that sounds a little bit you know uh wishy-washy but it's uh it's true like if it's there it's concrete it's really something uh it was there long before any of us and it'll be there a lot longer than any of us will ever be we hope um uh certainly if it goes we go so um but the process of learning from others and paying attention to others is is really an outward-looking thing I mean we have to bring that in but I was just curious how you balance those and as a way to really understand not just your time allocation right I think uh we could talk about that you know what's how's your morning structured Etc which I think there's Great Value in in in knowing but more um what what's your mind allocation right I think about this you know like where's my brain is it am I focus on what's going on in here and you know is that is there a need to excavate there sure you know but how much time am my out of my head and bringing things in from the outside world and back and forth so do you have some sense of um across the year across the day how you mind allocate I don't know if um that's the best phrase but I can't think of any better one if you can think of a better one please please uh table it cuz I I'm happy to to use that how do I think about mind allocation or attention [Music] allocation I try to and most frequently think of my mind share across a year and across week a weekly time frame and I find that to be manageable in the sense that on a yearly basis on New Year's Eve or roughly around New Year's every year I'll do a past year review pyr past year review where I'll go back and I'll look at my entire last year have a piece of paper in front of me line down the center plus negative and I will go through every week in my calendar for the pre previous year and I will write down the people places activities commitments Etc that produced Peak positive emotional experiences so right we're doing an 8020 analysis here like what are the big rocks that really move the needle in a meaningful way and conversely who are the people what are the things what are the places that just made me go g and we're draining produced Peak negative experiences why the hell did I commit to this type experiences and that presents me with a do more of do less of list then I look forward to the next year and I did this I suppose just a handful of months ago around New Year's with the Positive I'm like okay here's my list of do more of it's not real until it's in the calendar let's get these things in the calendar and then I will start talking to people booking things having people help with organizing if that is qu ired and getting things blocked out so I have already this year and we're in the reasonable beginning stages of the year I have things blocked out until November of this year and those provide the breaks in the action not just the breaks in the action but the fun stuff because by the way guys I thought for a long time like yeah you take care of ab andc and the good stuff just takes care of itself I have I do not any longer believe that to be true unless you schedule these things that you claim are important they're going to get crowded out by and maybe not but just less important things the Urgent will crush the important so I get these things on the calendar and then I back up and I look at optimal weekly mind allocation right attentional allocation and there's a there's there's an Incredible cost to cognitive switching if you're just test switching all day so I will try my best to format a weekly Rhythm a weekly sequence that allows me to focus on certain types of tasks so Monday is very frequently admin of some type just bits and ends flats and jets them all the miscellaneous pieces that are part of life you got to deal with them that tends to be Monday whenever possible and especially if I am focused on physical activity let's just say um in a place like Colorado I will try to schedule most of that for after lunch to ensure that I get in a lot of exercise and movement in the first portion of the day not everybody has that ability but I will say more of you have that capacity than you might think because most of what we all do is just not important yeah time on social media first thing in the morning is probably the most poisonous activity that I could take part in I I don't want to you know point fingers at anyone else but oh yeah I think if people ask you know what is the you know amount of time it takes to get in a really good workout it's going to be about an hour you know but a lot can be done in 45 or even 30 minutes you think about how quickly that time goes by on social media like I'm sure I'm not the only one uh that this part of the reason I deleted a lot of these apps from my phone it's like I would be I'd go into the bathroom to take a you know quick bit of business and then 45 minutes later I'm like how have I been looking at Instagram 45 minutes yeah lines in for restrooms have gotten very long in the last 10 10 years has anyone noticed that the wait for the restrooms has gotten very long so you have time for the important stuff it's like and and just look at some of the extreme over cheers out there they have the same amount of time that you do have you I was gonna ask this later about just we'll just quickly interject this now um I saw perhaps it was on Twitter maybe I overheard this that you're back on Instagram it's uh I mean you've always had an account yeah that posts but are you back in there are you out of there um I mean look my the Dirty Little Secret I'm single again and that's a great way to connect with with eligible ladies who might be of interest is Instagram so you're on um so you're on Instagram I'm willing to pay the tax of dealing with the brain damage of using Instagram as a result hey look finding a great life partner is exactly EXA exactly so that's that is the reason for that but otherwise it would not be on my phone it's too it wouldn't even be on your phone absolutely not it's too welld designed these companies are very smart they have very good data scientists they have very good UI Specialists if anyone out there thinks that they can look maybe maybe Joo can can discipline his way through it I'm sure he can because he's he is Joo but in my case and in the case of most people like you're bringing a knife to gunfight if you think you can use your self-control to keep your use of Instagram to say 10 minutes at a clip good luck yeah and even if you can people say ah but I do that anyway I'm like all right how much time do you spend sending memes and links from Instagram or fill-in the blank platform to your friends and group chat how much time does that consume I spend a fair amount of time on Instagram and Twitter posting things related to the podcast but um I don't have someone to do that for me and I I actually enjoy doing it and it challenges me in certain ways but I completely agree with everything you're saying I also want to note that you didn't say that you're on Twitter uh possibly to meet somebody um which is more a statement about Twitter yeah yeah it's not the it's not the not the friendliest neighborhood I've found and uh I would say Twitter has its use cases I I find it useful in some respects it has become much less useful and much less practical in the last year with a lot of the product changes but it has its place it's it's not on my phone it was on my phone for a very brief period of time I do not want I find that my ability to be still and calm is eroded if I am too easily able to escape boredom if you cease to have the ability to be bored for 5 to 10 minutes I think that makes you very fragile it makes you very easy to manipulate also and there are a lot of forces at play online that want to manipulate or shape your behavior in different ways so I feel like it is imperative for me to cultivate the ability to just sit still and not consume the five minutes in line waiting to get into a restaurant by hopping on Twitter or Instagram so that's part of the reason they're not on my phone could you tell us about punch yeah I can tell you about punch so punch is a creative project intended once again to make me less precious about protecting whatever brand I think I might have and this is an investment in my long-term mental health also and I think in my career flexibility my willingness to experiment punch could be a long story but the gist of it is I wanted to experiment with fiction writing I been saying this for years and I've never done it that's the backdrop on top of that I have wanted to get back into illustration and work in the visual arts which I did for a long time when I was younger and I've not done that consistent why not because I haven't had accountability I haven't had deadlines it hasn't been in the calendar this should sound somewhat familiar by now and at the same time I was becoming very interested in web 3 and what was happening in the world of nfts this is probably 2020 and I know theyve they've developed a fairly negative connotation for a lot of good reasons but I started to think about fundraising for early stage science and if I could do if I could conduct an experiment as a proof of concept with different novel approaches to fundraising so rather than just calling the rich friends who might sort of Bend to the pressure or be willing to fund I wanted to look at say crowdfunding back in the day then I wanted to look at different options for perhaps art auctions and I was going to do this with with Contemporary Art this is many years ago and in the process of wanting to fund the the Hopkins Center focused on psychedelic and Consciousness research which which the was the first of its kind in the United States and the technology gave me the opportunity to learn about a new let's just call it set of Technologies so to develop skills and knowledge it would give me the opportunity to reconnect and deepen friendships with a number of my very very smart friends who are playing in that area also test fundraising also get back into fiction and art and all of that combined into this thing that I end up calling punch because it made me laugh and you know what man if you take your work too seriously you're going to burn out before you get the really serious work done and I think it was uh berand Russell who said it's a sure sign of an impending nervous breakdown if you start taking your work too seriously or believing your work to be very very serious and for that reason I wanted to give it an absurd name that would also have some Word of Mouth benefit and that to see what would happen honestly just see what would happen because someone like all right look what is honestly the worst thing that happens like people write a bunch of pieces where they're like shaking their fist at the sky how dare Tim Ferris Co create a project called punch you could turn it around on them and just say that what they were doing is a punch no well attempting attemp that well that was kind of the thing uh that was kind of part of the thinking that it would just be entertaining to watch people seriously trying to critique something called punch and uh the upshot of that is it raised almost $2 million sold out out in something like 30 minutes or 40 minutes for the foundation all that money went to cam Foundation all that money has already been distributed in the form of Grants wonderful and uh along the way I got to work with artists with programmers learn new technologies reconnect with old friends and now we're back in touch and it's it's extremely fun to be back in touch with these folks and I've written the equivalent of a short book in fiction in the form of short stories that are this Fantasy World building exercise for me and I'm having a blast so I'm exercising new creative muscles that has led me back into the worlds of comic books which I haven't created yet led me back into the worlds of gaming led me back into my fascination with tabletop gaming because I played D and D forever when I was a kid that was my refuge as a runt who got the crap kicked out of him left and right and I having just a blast and the the takeaway I think on some level is that you should do things should is should is a is a is a loaded term it's helpful for me to consider doing things that give me energy right because if we say all right time management is fine but time doesn't really have any practical value unless you have attention right so then there's attentional management but that attention is limited also phys physically and sort of metaphorically by energy right so you have like substrates diets neurotransmitters and so on if you do not have the the basic batteries required the rest of the things that are higher up on that pyramid can't really be executed properly so for me it's like okay let's say cockp punch doesn't do anything it's total failure right coming back to like it already raised $2 million for Science and that science could be breakthrough science so so punch sorry I yelled sorry so punch is at least thus far a success it is but coming back to Seth Gooden's question I asked myself would I do this even if it turns out to be a complete failure financially and I was like yes because I think the relationships and the skills even if this quote unquote fails from the outside looking in those will transcend this project and be life affirming and helpful and fun in other areas and that's proven to be true even though the project is ongoing and I have more energy now because of this ridiculous project I'm very proud of the fiction actually this ridiculous project called punch people can find the legend of punch on uh any fine provider of podcasts and hired voice actors did the scripting the production I it hit number one fiction worldwide on Apple podcast for a while the whole thing's hilarious and um and if you could could you explain a little bit about the characters in Punch Yeah I gu who's who's punching who's yeah yeah or which are punching yeah which are punching which how does this work so here we go all right so Co The Legend Of punch takes place in this realm called varata and verata is being described through the narrator who we know as the seventh scribe we don't know much about the seventh scribe but the seventh scribe makes an appearance in episode one as the reliable but possibly sometimes unreliable narrator of this space and there's a there's a mind-bending Time component where there's something called restarts something like the edge of tomorrow if people have ever seen this movie where time restarts maybe like Groundhog Day time restarts and it's unclear as of yet in the story why that is the case but people basically snap into being they know who they are and what they do but they have no real memories to speak of so the world is constantly being constructed and pieced together by these scribes the seventh of which is the narrator so you can you you might read into this that I am a fan of fantasy tolken you name it URS Ursula kwinn the wizard of earthy Etc then there are eight primary houses these are the greater houses some might call them Clans and they have different characteristics just prior to this seventh scribe beginning his piecing together which turns into this story in the podcast there was a Waring States period this much he's been able to establish and the peacekeeping mechanism that was devised is something called the great games and the great games is a combat competition and the eight greater houses send their best fighters who've been vetted through preliminary competitions to the great games which is in the free trade zone which is this one place where all of the races mingle and trade and so on and all these characters happen to be anthropomorphized roosters so they have uh generally each one Gauntlet of some type and clearly they punch each other with this Gauntlet and they're many other types of weapons so the colloquial nickname for this Olympics of combat is punch and that is the that is the etymology uh so the scholars say of punch The Legend Of punch and there's a lot more to it and there are many wrinkles a lot of Easter eggs in this entire story the idea came to me and it started off as a bit of a farce right it was just going to be something funny see if it works maybe it raises some money very light lift but once I got into the fiction I started taking it super seriously so it's become very very elaborate it's become really really elaborate and I'm loving it it's great so who knows where it'll go I have no idea that's part of the reason why I called it an emergent long fiction project I didn't call it an nft project I was like this is an emergent long fiction project where I'm taking inputs from the audience I'm I'm watching very closely what people understand or don't understand or find interesting I'm looking at for instance what is generated when I host an an AI assisted art competition which I did with the fans and a lot of these bits and pieces get integrated in some fashion into this thing that chapter by chapter is coalescing so that's cockpunch amazing and I had to buy cockp punch.com in the at cockpunch Twitter you had to buy it from somebody oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah the whole process I don't want to ask what it was being used for prior to your purchasing it was not being used for uh Fantasy World building I'll put it that way got it amazing and for so many reasons I have so much to say about first of all your excitement about it is tangible yeah the energy you have around it is infectious um and while I don't want to go into the total um depth and Contour of uh what Paul kti has been telling me over the last week of preparing this mental health series about what's really great in life that we all should cultivate it has a lot to do with this generative Drive which has a lot to do with positive energy not just positive thinking but positive energy but this um this Triad of Peace contentment and delight and as you were explaining it it's clear that it brings you great peace contentment and Delight as action terms not like sit there and just hover in the Basking in it it's just so clear that this was a great idea um and I love that you started it as a way to kind of um uh I don't know like knock the fear out of yourself a little bit by knocking a little fear into the whole thing yeah like like what would happen if you let your mind go and and allowed yourself to explore this and and what permission would it by you if it's not a total disaster this is true for the 4-Hour Body too I'm like what if this partially works it's not even a home run but let's say I get on Bas what permission does this then buy me what other Impossibles in quotation marks am I willing to challenge and I was able to make the Hop from one category in the bookstore to a completely different category and then the sky's limit I was like I can do anything I can do whatever I want I've given myself permission and the market has given me permission but the most important first is you giving yourself permission and with say punch as ludicrous as it is now that I've done that my career hasn't ended hasn't had any negative impact on my career whatsoever I'm like okay that's actually kind of surprising to the contrary it seems like it gives you energy raised money for science is it still raising money is there still an opportunity for people to No it's contri it's sold out um if people want to contribute to to say the early stage science and let's just say specifically psychedelics I would say it's very very hard to get a very solid understanding of the field and the shifting Sands and the projects and so on it's it's very rapidly changing so I would say just provide money to a foundation that's already doing good work it could be riversticks Foundation it could be Beckley Foundation my Foundation Cay Foundation I think does pretty good work and Cay is not just the Jour uh the journalism fellowships they're also the it's funding for psychedelics oh there's tons of stuff there's a project page on Cay foundation.org you can see the projects they're probably 15 to 20 of them and they can see the basic science all the way from really basic science looking at possible mechanisms of action for something like dip which is a very strange compound that D yeah most people aren't going to know it that that produces profound auditory distortions and hallucinations in humans very hard to animal model and from that all the way up to really sophisticated Imaging studies from that to say at least a year or two ago supporting phase three trials for MDMA assisted Psychotherapy then the journalism then the this then the that but a lot of a lot of different uh scientific studies that are that are being supported so that's that's very exciting to me and but the the cockpunch side of things is all done Money's been distributed uh and maybe I'll do more of this kind of thing but I I might take a different approach I I feel like okay I learned what I feel I wanted to learn from that and maybe I'll try something new next time one thing's clear nobody tells you what to do um except you and but that's vetted through many important filters like structured filters and um very thoughtful filters are the words that come to mind when I think about yeah your process as you're sharing I one more thing which is one of the sources of Joy Of punch is that it is not over planned I set some initial conditions and now it's emerging and as someone who has hyper analyzed and meticulously planned most of my life for decades I think it's helpful to have an improv component so if you are a hyper planner if you're a hyper measurer if you like that degree of control maybe you should try something that's a little less controlled take an improv class try fiction writing do something that isn't totally scripted where you don't know the outcome I think it's really good medicine for people just like if you spend all your time in a yoga class maybe you should spend one day a week lifting weights see what that's like and if you spend all your time in the gym and you can barely touch your toes maybe you should do some more downward dog try some yoga similar I think the spectrum of hyper planned to completely free flowing and improv provides ample opportunity to uh enrich themselves and maybe address some weaknesses at the same time so for me punch has been incredibly therapeutic probably the first time that anyone has ever uttered that sentence but yes probably yeah but that's part of what makes it so cool yeah totally I love it I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share with us a little bit about your mindset um maybe even your motivation but um certainly your mindset around sharing some of the hard personal tribulations that you shared uh in preparation for this discussion today I went back to some of those posts that you did and the um podcasts that you did around this and um I listen to them at the time and um you know they deal with quite serious violations of childhood and of self and um they're hard I mean they're they're hard to listen to and I can only imagine they must be even far far harder to to experience and I was curious what led to your willingness to do that and um yeah I mean I have my own ideas about what might have motivated it but I'd like to hear it from you sure happy to talk about it uh and I think there are two particular examples that come to mind so one is my near suicide in college and uh if people search some practical thoughts on suicide and my name it'll pop right up I mean if you just search my name and suicide it'll probably pop right up pretty well indexed at this point which is very deliberate people can look at the URL structure for a little wink and uh hat tip uh it'll tell you something about optimizing for Google if you look at it I'll just tell you the URL is spells out how to commit suicide but clearly I'm not teaching people how to commit suicide but I wanted that to be a Honeypot for some of that traffic uh because it's a lot easier now to find that type of practical implementation advice and it's a bit harder to find I think compelling vention so first of all if you're feeling suicide obviously call Suicide Hotline please right uh that's sometimes the last thing that people want to hear when they are in a place of suicidal ideation and the reason I ended up writing a long post about this which was terrifying to write because I had never told my parents I had never told my closest friends this was a secret this is a dark dark secret and I wrote about it because I went to an event in San Francisco I was interviewed on stage by Jason calanis who's a friend and a very good interviewer at an event and after I got off stage a bunch of people approached me and I was saying hi and taking photos and signing things and so on and there was one young man there very well-dressed uh which isn't really relevant I just it was striking cuz in San Francisco sometimes people are very underdressed and he was he had dressed up for it like he' taken it seriously and he was in a suit and tie and he asked me if I could sign a book for his brother and I said sure no problem and I asked him what would you like me to write to your brother and he kind of blanked he didn't kind of blank he totally blanked but the look behind his eyes was unusual it wasn't just I don't know what to say blank there was something else behind it and I could tell that he felt under pressure and I said no problem take your time I tell you what I'll just chat with a couple of other people and I'll sign the book no problem I'm not going anywhere and chatted with the other folks and then he asked if he could just walk me to the elevator and then I could sign the book I was like sure and he explained to me as I walked to the elevator how his brother had been a huge fan of mine and that I'd really kept his brother afloat for a long time and eventually his brother killed himself and that they' kept his room exactly how it was and he wanted me to sign the book so that he could put the book in his brother's room and he asked me if I'd ever considered talking about mental health and mental health challenges publicly because he thought it would really help a lot of people and that just I mean I'm like feeling myself tear up right now I mean it's it it was so crushing to hear the story and totally unbeknownst to him I had a lot of history with depressive episodes and when I say near suicide I had it on the calendar I had a plan I was going to kill myself I knew exactly how I was going to do it I knew where I was going to do it I knew all of the variables that I needed to account for to get it done and and the only reason that didn't happen for people who don't have the contacts which most people W is I had tried to reserve a book at Firestone Library this is at Princeton which had something to do with suicide it was like assisted suicide like the the clinicians guide to euthanasia something like that and it wasn't in and I had forgotten to change my address at the register office I was taking a year away from school and that was to focus on finishing my thesis it was to try a few jobs but ID ended up in a very bad place and was feeling very isolated and my friends were graduating a year ahead of me and I was stuck on this thesis and there's a lot of backstory that I won't bore people with but it got to the point where I decided not that objectively objectively my life is bad I think this is where people who haven't experienced depression get a little confused or it's hard for them to identify when they give advice to a depressed person because you might say to a depressed person like but look your life is so great like there's this there's that there's this and for a lot of depressed people to say yeah I know I look at that and I can't fix my state because I am broken and if this is how I'm going to have to live forever with being this broken and dysfunctional and to have this internal hell that I live day by day I just want to escape it's like someone jumping out of a burning building it's like they don't want to kill themselves but they're jumping out of a burning building and so I had it on the calendar and thank God this was back when they would still send you a physical reminder in the mail a little postcard that says your book is in and that card went to my parents house and my mom saw it and panicked and called me and I lied I said it was for a friend who went to Rutgers who was doing a project on AB andc but it's it was just enough to kind of snap me out of the trance and realize that killing yourself is like putting on a suicide vest with explosives and walking into a room of all the people you care the most about and and blowing yourself up so that snapped me out of it but no one knew this this guy certainly didn't know that and that is when I went home and thought about it and just decided okay there's a chance if I write this it's not certain but there's a chance that this might help someone it might prevent someone from doing what I was almost about to do and so I spent months getting this post written and put it out and I and I know for a fact it has saved minimum dozens of lives and there are other things including a very extensive list of resources and uh so that gave me I suppose uh not a toe in the water but sort of jumping feet first into the deep end and experience of being that vulnerable and this was a long time ago I mean this is I want to say at least eight to 10 years ago when I put that post out and uh then uh I want to say it was just before covid lockdown I was in Costa Rica visiting a friend I was with my girlfriend at the time and she knew a secret of mine and she was one of maybe two or three people who knew that i' had been sexually abused when I was a kid by babysitter's son from 2 to four roughly and routinely all the time kind of thing and like what you're envisioning is is is is is what happens so it was not good and that had been compartmentalized and locked away for my whole life I was like that's in the past we're Focus on moving forward and uh nothing to be fixed nothing to fix and that was my my perspective on things uh it turned out wasn't quite that simple right and so I had done a lot of work a lot of therapy used psychedelic assist therapies as well uh which once again are not all upside potential there are some significant risks but I had come a long way and my plan had always been to wait until my parents passed because I didn't want them to blame themselves for this and then to write a book and there was something though at the time when I was having dinner with my girlfriend that was dissatisfying about that plan it there's something about it that bothered me and I couldn't quite put a finger on it and I was talking to her about it and she said that's going to take a long time she's like have you ever thought about how many people people are going to pass away or die or suffer between now and when you publish that book and uh I thought about it and it was at that dinner that I decided to at least record a podcast covering this terrain I was not at all convinced that I wanted to publish it I I I was terrified of publishing it also because it meant open myself up to a lot of conversations or maybe just uh hurtful commentary online who knows like people are there are a lot of idiots out there and a lot of otherwise fine people who are idiots on the internet so it's very hesitant ultimately decided I I didn't want to do it as a oneman show I didn't want to make it a monologue so I asked my friend Debbie milman who had been on my podcast she's amazing graphic designer and teacher but she had unexpectedly on my podcast based on some of my questions for the first time publicly told her story about being sexually abused and so I had leaned on her in years after that in private and I asked her if she'd be willing to have a conversation with me about our respective Journeys and what it felt like what it looked like what helped what didn't help what worked what didn't to provide at the very least a glimmer of hope for people who were keeping some of these dark secrets or contending with them not knowing what to do with them and we had that conversation and I sat on it I sat on it I sat on it and then I put it out and decided in advance that I would not look at any social media for at least several weeks afterwards if my team saw anything on social media or got email I didn't want to see anything other than positive feedback which is not my deao I I'm usually eager to solicit constructive feedback but in this case I I knew that my own position was too vulnerable I I I I didn't want to open up the possibility of of destabilizing myself and I put it out and I think it's the most important podcast I've ever put out so I kind of felt like my job was done from a podcasting perspective after that and it's been incredibly gratifying I think it has certainly helped a fair number of people and it was also really hard because what I didn't anticipate was I would say of my really super high performing close male friends maybe half reached out to me to tell someone for the first time about their extremely awful graphic firsthand experience of being sexually abused the percentages were mind-blowing like the the actual percentages were super super super high uh which is part of the reason I mentioned earlier I think it's good to spend a little bit of time in those empty spaces to see you know am I in a positive energetic sense pursuing something good or am I running away from demons whipping my back and for a lot of those guys I'm sure it's true for a lot of women too like they they find medication through intense focus and achievement uh which is super adaptive in a lot of ways but it doesn't always have lifetime reliability [Music] and that's the story um it's impossible to hear those stories your story without um feeling some substantial emotion I'm not trying to intellectualize it's um both both of those uh aspects of your history that you shared are huge they really are they're obviously huge for you and and they're huge in terms of the positive impact in the world I I know this because um I have read the comments right and I and I've talked to people who have listened to those podcasts and read those blogs and um and have similar or maybe different stories of trauma but I think uh as with your work in the Psychedelic space as with your work in um the physical augmentation space whatever you want to call it um it's apparent that you're willing to be first man in on a lot of things and really make you're sitting alone there in those moments and uh these categories of revealing trauma are in my mind anyway so much more substantial in terms of their impact positive impact and the other aspects forour body and psychedelic work etc is also tremendously impactful so that's saying a lot so just want to say thank you for for your uh bravery and um thanks Andrew yeah it's um it's crazy because I think that a lot of people um can imagine telling a story or to a close friend or something but you know to put it out into the world you know it's like it's huge like you don't know how that's going to Ripple um and you've been a real Pioneer and example for uh for me for for LAX for other people and revealing things not like that um but different and Peter AA has recently been opening up about some serious challenges that he's had in his in his book he does that on podcast he's been doing it so um you know yet another category um arguably the most important category for um exploration and sharing and you know thoughtful bravery right because you didn't just put it out there in any form so uh one thing I do know by experience is there's nothing weirder than being uh told thank you for the painful thing that you did so I don't want to push that too far but I'd be remiss if I didn't because it it really has its impact and for doing it again here today because um so yeah that huge thanks for doing that yeah my my pleasure and I also say you know I got advice from a very very experienced uh psychedelic facilitator at one point who said take the pain to make it part of your medicine and the way I think that applies here is we all experience pain we all experience suffering many of us have experienced trauma of one type or another and that can consume you I mean it can consume you but it's like fire right it can consume you but you can also harness it and use it for different things and I know for I think it's I'm not going to hedge I'll say I know for a fact that there are people I've spoken to who are suicidal and by the way I'm not inviting everyone who's listening if you are suicidal to reach out to because it won't work I've had to disengage from that because it gets too heavy right just to engage one-onone with people who are suicidal but there are resources in that post Dimension the Practical thoughts on suicide but let's just talk about closer friends people you would never suspect in a million years who were this close to blowing their brains out people folks would recognize in some cases the fact that I was also there once is why they listen to me because I have unfortunately I'm a sub matter expert right I have credibility and that actually is very redeeming it provides some meaning to the suffering that I experienced it's like okay here I am for whatever host of reasons I am put in this place and time with this person and they don't trust the input of these other people they're talking to because those people don't know what it's like but I can look at this person in the eye and be like oh I know and that's just a different thing so you can you can find a way to transmute that pain into something meaningful into a gift that hopefully you can share in some way not necessarily with the whole wide world just one person that's a big deal one person's a big deal there's a lot out there that is intended for Mass consumption that gets in front of millions of people doesn't really impact a single person very much so even if you don't have podcast you don't have books if you have the ability to sit down with one person and really make an impact that's actually more meaningful than most of the crap that gets put out there so take heart Amen to that i' like to spend a little bit of time talking about the roles you see yourself in you know I I had this list coming in here of okay you've done the um exploration of the health sphere you um self- experimentation you you're uh you've been an investor you are an investor you're podcaster you're you know I think these are more than titles I I think titles are great but titles are what we get from other people telling us what we do or deciding what we do um I'm more interested in how you think about yourself like your your own role identity and you know I have to assume you've spent a little bit of time on this like if when we to go through the the the checklist of possible roles yeah right okay I confess I do this I think like okay like I I think I call I think I check the box of animal because we're we're animals after all and we're you know humans you still pole dancing I think he's a pole dancer absolutely not um are you still Tango dancing I'm planning on getting back into it great that that does have some background I have Argentine lineage and I'm embarrassed to say I don't Tang uh know Tango but you got the you got the mate in the in the green room so you're s my my uh grandparents uh Tango into their 80s I think late ' 80s yeah late 80s yeah ate steak and smoked cigarettes and uh lived until their 90s artine dieted Champions exactly um but I'm curious about the roles that you see yourself in like you know um role identity to me is so important um in terms of where we see ourselves now and where we see ourselves going forward and who knows maybe you don't have any Ro identity plan but you know what are some boxes that you see yourself in now that you really strongly identify with and then what are some boxes that um you'd like to check off going forward so current boxes I would say the two that I probably identify with most maybe three but I I'll I'll focus on two experimentalist which can take a lot of forms that can that can apply to a whole lot of different spheres so experimentalist and then teacher and for the longest time long long time I thought eventually I would go back and actually be a ninth grade teacher because I feel like that is such a critical window for so many kids where they can either hit an inflection point and go in a really good direction or they can go in a really bad Direction and I certainly saw that on Long Long Island with a lot of my friends a lot of overdoses bunch of friends who have died of opiate addiction and various things and I had some intervention with mentors early on that that sort of flipped the switch on the railroad track and sent me in a different direction so I thought for a long time I would go back and be a ninth grade teacher and my impulse to experiment leads to enthusiasm for teaching if that makes any sense because I feel like as good as I might be or decent at taking a complex subject deconstructing it applying 820 putting things in order and learning things very quickly uh which includes stress testing assumptions in that uh sort of assumed progression for skill like language learning there's so many myths in language learning as an example if it takes me say six months to become reasonably competent in field X I can usually get other people to that same point of competence in a third of that time so for me it's very gratifying to teach and I view all the books as teaching tools I'm no totoy I recognize I'm not the world's greatest writer I take the writing seriously uh I don't have asset I do many many many revisions even for punch it's like 27 revisions for a short story called cockp so I take it seriously but I recognize that I'm not the world's greatest Wordsmith but I am looking for outcomes in readers or listeners and I view my job as that of teacher so I'd say experimentalist and teacher of the two and those both go a long way and applies to say dog training you know lots ran lots of experiments and then for was listening to him just looked under the table one thing I should have said at the beginning and I did not is that um this is the first H Lab podcast to feature a guest who brought their dog so we have Molly is here as well and we're absolutely delighted uh there has not been a dog at on the hubman Lab podcast since uh Costello passed away and uh I'm you know practically floating in in Delight that Molly's here today she's she's amazing and you've done amazing job training her too so thank you yeah she's she's laying right next to my feet licking my hand as I speak so good and I'd say if I were to expand that by one I would probably say explore but the exploring goes hand inand with the experimentation uh so that could be Geographic exploration it could be spending time with people who are excellent at anything in any field MH and seeing where that gingerbread Trail leads me and I think the the the exploration and the experimentation are for me bed fellows they go together what about roles that you would like to explore or potentially see yourself in I mean I don't have a magic wand but if I did as a fellow podcaster and I consider you a friend uh I would say okay like if I could wand you to the success in given role that wouldn't be the way it would work that wouldn't be as gratifying as having to figure it all out cuz that's part of your your Machinery uh as you just told us so yeah what are some role life roles that you're interested in expanding and uh or stepping into that you haven't explore I'd say more more artists more Artistry especially in the visual sense because I wanted to be a comic book pencor for a really long time got paid as an illustrator uh towards the end of high school and during college so Illustrated books and magazines and so on then I just dropped it I dropped it when I graduated because I was kid stuff and it was time to get serious and be an adult and I just cold turkey just stopped all of it and so the skills have atrophied a lot but there's still there's still a bit in there I've seen some posts on Instagram that were yeah quite good so I'm still messing around I'm still messing around and especially when I have some structure I do well so I'd like to pursue that I would like to experiment with animation so I don't know if animator would be the right label CU I most likely would not be doing the animation myself but playing a role in visual art would be one uh father would be another one eventually and uh try not to be attached to it but we all play games of various types and if we get really good at certain games that are socially rewarded then you make money doing a podc or investing or whatever might be but when my when when when the sort of ramp of my learning starts to flatten out a bit I tend to get bored of those games and I think that certainly one of the biggest adventures must be Parenthood so at some point I think father would be on there and I should say this is very judgmental of me to say but I think there's a big difference between wanting to wanting to be a parent and wanting to have kids I'm I'm very cautious about saying I want to have kids because that doesn't automatically imply you want to be a good parent which is also why I thought it was very important for me to spend a lot of time training Molly and a lot of learning there right yeah to she's like all right am I going to do the heavy lifting and the hard work recognizing that kids are not deferred dogs but I do think there actually a lot of similarities uh in terms of just predictive ability if you see someone who has dogs that are terribly trained look at their kids you might see some similarity my my good friend um my good friend I'll out him here who's a mdp is their chair of Opthalmology at Stanford Jeff Goldberg I once asked him if he has any pets and he said that he and his wife had three children as preparation for having a dog that's there is there's a quote also from a book called Don't Shoot the dog which is terrible title but excellent book written by Karen PRI who was a an aquatic mammal trainer so she's training dolphins and whales and so on which don't respond to negative reinforcement you can't really hit them with a rolled up newspaper if they don't do what you want and there's a quote in that book which is something along the lines of I can't remember the attributions another trainer and it was people should not be allowed to have children until they've successfully trained a chicken because also chickens like they they just don't have the brain power to respond to uh much negative reinforcements so you have to coax them to do what you want them to do with positive reinforcement and I mean Opera in classical conditioning it's kind of same Sam across the board uh whether you're like uh the CIA trying to train cockroaches to flip light switches not making that one up by the way or training will or training a cat or training a human uh training sounds bad cultivating a wonderful human yeah then I think there's a lot to be learned across the board so I've successfully proven to myself that I can keep a dog alive and happy yeah and train up another happy nervous system yeah you know curate another nervous system that's a big deal oh yeah well she's also like my external nervous system so we we sort of work in tandem I pay a lot of attention to how she relates to different people I saw earlier today I mean as someone who is the owner of a Bulldog Mastiff who knew one command which was weight which is which is the the by default the easiest thing to train a bulldog because it when when you by the way folks if you stop a bulldog on the street to scratch them and they look delighted they might like you but chances are they're just really relieved that they get to stop so and um Costello he had a forbrain and he was smart about what he need to be smart about but Molly is exceptional like she knows where she needs to be and she's super connected to you and she knows a ton of commands it was ridiculous staff was like delighting in the number of things that Tim could get her to do just by looking at her yeah yeah yeah she's uh she's also quite calm out of the box uh which helps although it makes it harder in some respects to train because she doesn't have much food drive she liked those Maui Nei sticks we ma sticks yeah she loves the Maui NE venison sticks but she well okay I'll I'll give I'll say two things so first is if your dog is a spaz about food that's actually great news it will make your dog very easy to train in some respects uh read don't shoot the dog it's it's excellent and there are some others I could recommend I had a woman named Su uh Susan Garrett on my podcast because I wanted an objective measure of successful dog training and competitors have objective measures so she was an a dog agility Champion for many years which has a lot of metrics so anyway I had her on for people who are interested but the the the tip that I got from one dog trainer early on because I was trying to train Molly and I was using just some of her kibble I'd like put some kibble in a bag and carried around and she was like what are you doing and I said what do you mean what am I doing she's like is that kibble I'm like yeah it's kibble and she goes she's like hey pal she's like you're at a crowded bar you got a tip with 20s nice to get your dog's attention you take your to the dog park it's like squirrels other dogs grass piss on the pavement whatever it happens to be you have to have good treats so if your dog isn't responding chances are maybe you're trying to tip with singles I love it I love it well thank you for sharing the roles you see yourself in and the ones that you'd like to step into more uh I certainly feel I have the jurisdiction to say that you are an exceptional experimentalist and a phenomenal teacher we've seen this across so many you're welcome and and I'm not just speaking for myself I'm speaking speaking for so many other people as well we've seen this across so many domains it's like blogging podcast in book writing stage lecturing being a guest on a podcast you know and on and on and um in terms of the roles that you want to expand into more I can't wait to see the illustrations that that emerge yeah please do uh grow that flame because I I'm excited for what comes out um punch being um just the first of them leading the charge yeah um and uh you know I can say because I know uh because I have one and because I um uh have observed many uh kids and friends uh who are fathers you're going to be an exceptional father I'm absolutely confident of that yeah I appreciate that yeah and I want to say thanks for taking the time to talk with me today I've been looking forward to this so much my team knows this wait we were sort of buzzing like you we've had some Heavy Hitters on this podcast you know uh we only look to the top 1% in field and they are you know incredibly credentialed by whatever standards we happen to be exploring and they have to be people people that I really want to talk to so um I have so much respect for what you do and the way you do it uh you certainly inspired me this podcast would not exist I don't think the genre of podcasting would exist and look the way that it does had you not made the decision to start podcasting and um in anticipation of this episode did put out a ping on Twitter for questions and there were many many of them um that maybe we'll do a Q&A sometime maybe not who knows but you know one of the questions that really stood out to me was you know how does Tim feel about all these other people coming into all the spaces that he's worked and doing um successful work that builds off so much of what he's done and uh I'll let you answer but for me I can say that um I've been positively inspired and built so much of what we've been doing here and um and what I think about based on the ways that you've podcasted and communicate with the public to maintain your stance and integrity in the way that you interact with people it's really inspiring and you've always been so gracious to me and uh so humble and so giving and um and at the same time I know there's a fierce guy in there who likes to get it done so once again thanks for being first man in thanks for taking on all the roles that you have and that you are and that you will and thanks for being a giver we all benefit thanks Andrew uh really appreciate you saying all that and I want people to just get after it take things seriously have fun and be really really good so watching for instance what you've done which has been so spectacular so well executed makes me super happy and I don't view anyone as competition uh in the podcasting world for instance in the book world I don't view it that way either and I just hope that people keep experimenting pushing the envelope and if people aren't say getting better over time if people aren't following who are substantially better than me in all of these ways uh then I would be super disappointed so every time I see someone doing something really impressive or doing something I never would have thought of I get so extremely excited I I find it really fun to watch so appreciate you also just getting out there and hard charging and taking your podcast as seriously as you do I mean I I've seen the notes I've seen the setup I met the team it's it's very inspiring for me also makes me want to dust off my cleats and get back on the field so oh man you've never left the field and you've had a hand in it all so thank you so much and um hope you'll come back and visit us again here yeah I hope so it's been a real pleasure I've been looking forward to this for a long time time as well and I

Title: The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-06-12 12:00:47 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTDS, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today we are discussing MDMA sometimes referred to as ecstasy or Mali MDMA stands for methylene dioxy methamphetamine that's right you heard the word methamphetamine in there and MDMA has properties similar to methamphetamine but also properties that are very distinct from methamphetamine just as a side note methamphetamine is a commonly used drug of abuse it is an illicit drug and it produces some of the greatest and fastest increases in the neuromodulator dopamine of any available drugs on the street or in the clinic and believe it or not methamphetamine is prescribed as a prescription drug in some very limited clinical uses MDMA methylene dioxy methamphetamine has properties similar to methamphetamine in that it powerfully promotes the release of dopamine and it is a stimulant and yet it also powerfully controls the release of Serotonin and in doing so makes MDMA a distinct category of compound from either classic psychedelics like psilocybin or LSD which largely work on the serotonin system and tend to produce mystical experiences and it's also distinct from Pure stimulants such as methamphetamine because MDMA by producing big increases in both dopamine and serotonin acts as what's called an empathogen it actually can increase one sense of Social connectedness and empathy not just for other people but for oneself and in that way MDMA is commonly used as a recreational drug but also is now being tested and is a achieving incredible early results in clinical trials for its use as an empathogen for the treatment of PTSD in clinical therapeutic settings I want to be very clear that at this point in time June 2023 MDMA is still a schedule one drug that is it is highly illegal to possess or sell in the United States and today we are going to talk about some of the path to legality that's underway we are also going to talk about the history of MDMA and why it became illegal and we are going to talk about the key difference between recreational use and therapeutic use and the important components of the studies exploring MDMA in the clinical setting for the treatment of PTSD so during today's discussion we will talk about what MDMA really is how it works at the level of neurons which brain circuits it activates and deactivates and in doing so you will come to understand why it is so exciting as a treatment for PTSD will you will also of course talk about the results of of these clinical trials using MDMA for the treatment of PTSD they are incredibly exciting in fact the field of Psychiatry has never before seen the kind of success in treatment of PTSD with any other compound that they are seeing and achieving with the appropriate safe use of MDMA and when I say appropriate that means in conjunction with nine therapy sessions so this is an area that really deserves some time for us to discuss because again there is a distinct difference between the recreational and the therapeutic use of MDMA we will also talk about the toxicity of MDMA this is a very important issue because many of you have perhaps heard that MDMA quote unquote puts holes in your brain or kills serotonin neurons or kills dopamine neurons and indeed MDMA because of its similarity to methamphetamine which is highly neurotoxic MDMA can be neurotoxic however there are ways to use MDMA therapeutically that avoid avoid its toxicity and yet there are still questions about its toxicity and its long-term effects both after acute use meaning just one to three times as well as chronic use meaning people who have taken it many many times we'll talk about the spacing between sessions of MDMA we will talk about dosages we will also talk about things that people do and that can be done to offset some of the potential toxicity of MDMA so by the end of today's discussion you will have a thorough understanding of what MDMA is what it isn't what is known about what it does what is known about what it doesn't do as well as some of the still outstanding questions about MDMA that remain to be resolved before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are the absolute highest quality I started sleeping on a helix mattress over two years ago and since starting to sleep on a helix mattress I've had the best sleep of my life and that's because the mattress is tailored to my unique sleep needs everybody has unique sleep needs and if you go to the Helix website you can take a very brief two minute quiz we'll ask you questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your side or your stomach are you somebody who tends to run warm or cold during the night Etc perhaps you don't know the answers to those questions that's fine you can simply put that response and Helix will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs this is so critical because sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance and when we are sleeping well consistently everything in life goes that much better and when we are not sleeping well consistently everything suffers there's a ton of science to support those statements so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to helixsleep.com huberman take their two-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to 350 off all mattress orders and two free pillows again if you're interested you can go to helixsleep.com huberman for up to 350 off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by Roca Roca Mike's eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind I've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different Channel challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roka understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity their eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for sports performance and as a consequence they are very lightweight which is great they also won't slip off your face if you get sweaty however even though they were designed for sports performance they now also include a lot of styles that are designed to be worn to work out to dinner essentially recreationally so that you could wear anywhere if you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses go to Roka that's roka.com and enter the code huberman to save 20 off your

most people are familiar with or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet it's used for weight loss it's used to control epilepsy it's used for mental health reasons however most people including myself do not follow a ketogenic diet nonetheless increasing your blood ketones can improve the function of your brain and the function of your body and that's because ketones are preferred use of fuel for the brain and body so even though I follow an omnivore diet that is I'm not in a ketogenic State I use Ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones prior to doing preparation for podcasts or writing grants or doing research as well as prior to workouts especially if I want to work out fasted I'll take some Ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones which gives me a lot of energy during workouts or during bouts of cognitive work even if I haven't eaten in the preceding hours it really increases my focus and my energy levels if you'd like to try Ketone IQ you can go to hvmn.com huberman to save 20 off again that's hvmn.com huberman to save 20 let's talk about MDMA MDMA or ecstasy is a fascinating compound and I say fascinating from the perspective of its chemical structure which is highly unusual I say fascinating because it has an incredible set of subjective effects in terms of how it makes people feel and it has a fascinating history so let's just briefly start with the history of MDMA MDMA was synthesized by the drug company Merck in the early 1900s but it actually was never applied to any particular clinical use and it wasn't really explored much in any Laboratories at all and then it was later rediscovered by a guy named Alexander shulgin who was a bit of a renegade drug chemist who was designing different drugs for the purpose of understanding their subjective effects on humans so there's a long history of Shogun designing drugs he was after all a chemist and then taking those drugs himself and then if he liked the effects of a particular drug or rather if he thought that it had potential clinical utility he would give it to his wife then she would give him her notes about those drugs and then they would share them with their friends and it was a small group of friends who consisted of therapists and Physicians so this was a really underground kind of operation it was technically not illegal when it started because MDMA wasn't illegal when it started but over the several decades that Shogun and his wife and this group were doing this kind of exploration MDMA did become illegal and he fell under well let's just say scrutiny by the DEA now here's the important thing to understand about MDMA and its history first of all MDMA is a synthetic compound as far as we know it does not exist anywhere in nature so unlike similar compounds such as mescaline because MDMA and masculine are very similar in their chemical properties and to some extent their subjective properties unlike mescaline which can be found in the plant kingdom or LSD which comes from ergot or psilocybin which of course can be found in magic mushrooms MDMA is a unique chemical in that again as far as We Know only exists in its synthetic form it is human made and as we get into the chemical effects and the subjective effects of MDMA a little bit later in the episode I think you'll understand why it is such a unique and to some extent exciting compound from the perspective of clinical treatment put differently there's really no other compound that we know of in nature or in the pharmaceutical industry shelf or options of drugs that are prescription drugs that produce the kinds of effects that MDMA does and by the way if you're interested in the story of Alexander Shogun and the drugs he synthesized and the group that he built up to take these drugs and try them and actually had several members of this group using these drugs in therapy with their patients for a long period of time both before and after MDMA became illegal there's a wonderful book called pikal that stands for p-i-k-h-a-l p call is the title of the book which Shogun wrote which describes his discovery of MDMA I confess it also describes the synthesis of MDMA and for that reason was a book that for a long time was not available but is now available again in audible form and in printed form pcall stands for phenylethylamines I have known and loved phenylethylamines is the category of drug for which MDMA belongs to and it's a long book but a very interesting one both from the perspective of understanding the history of MDMA and what MDMA is and the effects that it produces but it's also an interesting book because it will teach you a lot about the history of the pharmaceutical industry the War on Drugs in the United States and the interaction between illegal drug exploration and drugs for clinical treatment of psychiatric challenges so right now this is a very important issue because MDMA is currently granted breakthrough status which means it's now something that scientists and clinicians can study if they have authorization to do that it is as I mentioned earlier still a schedule on drugs so it's illegal to possess unless you are one of these scientists who has been granted permission to study it in the clinical setting or the laboratory setting and right now we are on the cusp of MDMA becoming legal but again it is not yet legal and this is something I'm going to touch back on a few times during today's episode later for instance when we talk about the potential toxicity of MDMA its ability potentially to kill neurons the neurons it has been hypothesized to kill are neurons of the serotonin and dopamine type so this is something you would not want let's just recall that killing off of or death of dopamine neurons is the underlying basis for Parkinson's Disease which is a movement disorder where people have difficulty generating smooth movements and in very severe form they can't move at all they sort of become locked in to some extent and it also has cognitive effects so you don't want to lose dopamine neurons and loss of serotonergic neurons is known to impact mood negatively mood regulation negatively Etc the story of MDMA and its potential neurotoxicity comes slam right up against this issue of legality and what we'll get into a little bit later is that there has been a sort of race in the scientific Community consisting of two groups one set of groups trying to establish the toxicity of MDMA so that it does not become legal again and another group trying to establish the utility and the lack of toxicity in MDMA so that it does become legal again for the treatment of PTSD so even though the story P call relates to events that took place largely in the 1970s 80s and 90s right now MDMA and its toxicity or lack of toxicity its legality or lack of legality are really key issues so as you're listening to this I'm giving you a real-time blow-by-blow of what led up to where we are now but we will also want to think about how what's happening right now including the description of these data on MDMA may or may not impact the potential legal status of MDMA okay so what is MDMA MDMA is 3 4 methylene dioxy methamphetamine but unless you're a chemist that's not going to mean much to you nor should it MDMA has some very interesting properties the first of which is that methamphetamine component which because it's a methamphetamine and acts like other amphetamines what it does is it blocks the reuptake of dopamine from neurons after dopamine is released so for those of you that heard the episode that I did on drugs to treat ADHD I discussed the biology and mechanisms of drugs like Adderall and Vyvanse which basically are either combinations of amphetamines or single types of amphetamines that have either a quick release or a long release now MDMA because it has this methamphetamine component prevents the reuptake of dopamine and in doing so creates net increases in dopamine so for those of you that don't have a background in neurobiology let me just briefly explain I'll make this very simple neurons or nerve cells release chemicals at their sites of communication which are called synapses synapses are little gaps between neurons and what happens is the neurons spit out these little spherical balls which we call vesicles or vesicles depending on where in the world you live they'll either be called vesicles or vesicles and those little vesicles contain neurotransmitter or what's technically referred to as a neuromodulator dopamine is a neuromodulator can modulate the activity of other neurons it can either increase or decrease the activity of other neurons now at the end of the neuron that what we call the axonal Bouton okay axon is the wire component of the neuron that can reach to another side in the brain and then release the neurotransmitter or neuromodulator there at those axonal boutons which are the sites of release the vesicles literally fuse with the edge of the neuron and vomit their neuromodulator out into the synapse and then the neuromodulator in this case dopamine will bind to receptors on the postsynaptic side that means to another neuron and then depending on how much binds and depending on what else is going on in that local neighborhood of neuronal connections the neuron will either increase its neural activity and itself release neuromodulator and neurotransmitter someplace else so sort of a chain reaction or else it will suppress its activity and the flow of communication from one neuron to the next will be stopped okay so MDMA doesn't prevent the release of dopamine at the synapse it does quite the opposite it actually prevents the sucking up of the dopamine that's been released and that does not bind to The receptors so basically what it does is it blocks these things called dopamine Transporters and the Transporters are the things that suck back up the dopamine that's been released that has not bound to receptors so because it blocks that sucking up process there's more dopamine around in the synapse to hang out and then bind to receptors once some become available okay the other thing that the methamphetamine component of MDMA does just like methamphetamine is that it actually gets into what we call the presynaptic neuron the neuron that releases the dopamine and it interferes with the repackaging of dopamine into those vesicles now you might think oh it interferes with the repackaging of dopamine into vesicles and therefore less will be released but actually what happens is as a consequence of that a bunch of dopamine builds up in the presynaptic neuron so that when an electrical impulse comes down that neuron and dopamine is released a huge amount of dopamine is released and this is one of the characteristic properties of methamphetamine end of MDMA which is that it leads to enormous increases in the amount of dopamine released and the amount of dopamine that hangs around in the synapse and therefore it increases what we call dopaminergic Tone or dopaminergic drive that's just a bunch of different ways to describe increases in dopamine okay so that's the main way that MDMA and by extension methamphetamine increase dopamine however MDMA is not just methamphetamine it's methylene dioxide methamphetamine and it has another incredible property which is that it doesn't just lead to huge increases in dopamine it also leads to huge increases in serotonin and that's because there are other neurons that release serotonin and they have serotonin transporters which are sometimes called certs s-e-r-t-s's serotonin Transporters and they work very much in the same way that dopamine Transporters do right they basically control the sucking backup of Serotonin that's been released into the synapse and that has not bound to serotonin receptors on the other neurons yet and in doing so allow more serotonin to hang out and have its effects as those receptors become available for serotonin to bind to them the other thing MDMA does is it also gets into the presynaptic neuron to impact the packaging of Serotonin into something called the vesicle monoamine transporter for serotonin and in doing so it leads to a big buildup of serotonin in presynaptic Terminals and then massive increases in serotonin release okay so what we've got with MDMA is a really interesting compound unlike methamphetamine or other amphetamines such as adderall Vyvanse Etc that cause increases in dopamine by blocking reuptake and increasing release of dopamine MDMA does that but it also does the same thing for serotonin and here's a really key point the increases in serotonin that MDMA creates are at least three times and maybe as much as eight times greater than the amount of dopamine released that MDMA causes but when you put those two things together what you basically have is a drug that causes huge increases in dopamine and even bigger increases in serotonin and remember earlier when I said that MDMA is a purely synthetic compound as far as we know it does not exist in any plants or fungus or anything else in nature well this is a very unusual circumstance of having big increases in dopamine and big increases in serotonin caused by the same compound and that combination of big increases in dopamine and big increases in serotonin are what lead to these highly unusual and yet what seem to be potentially clinically very beneficial effects of having people feel a lot of mood elevation and a lot of stimulation from the stimulant properties of the methamphetamine component and so that's the dopamine effect the dopaminergic tone goes way up so it's a stimulant people feel really alert they feel like talking a lot they feel very excited they feel a lot of positive motivation these are classic effects of drugs that promote the release of dopamine including amphetamine cocaine Etc but ordinarily that's not such a good thing because what happens is there's then a crash in the dopamine levels and then people feel depressed they feel lethargic they they don't feel good at all MDMA seems to cause these increases in dopamine and all the accompanying effects I just described but by also causing big increases in serotonin it activates neural networks that are associated with feeling more socially connected in fact we'll talk about data in a little bit where people have had their brains imaged while under the influence of MDMA and it's very clear that people who have taken MDMA look at faces that ordinarily they would rate as fearful and rate them as less fearful they see faces that are smiling and they rate those smiling happy faces as more positive than they would off the drug the big increases in serotonin create what we call a pro-social effect and that combined with the dopaminergic increase in mood and the stimulation effect creates this thing that we call an empathogen where and this is very important the empathy isn't just for other people it's also for oneself and one's own experiences happening in the moment as well as empathy for experiences from the past which so you can imagine could be very beneficial for the treatment of PTSD Okay so hopefully the way I describe the biology of MDMA makes some sense if you didn't get anything out of the description I provided except the understanding that MDMA is unusual in that it causes big increases in dopamine and even bigger increases in serotonin then you have more in your knowledge base now about MDMA than you need in order to understand the rest of our discussion before we go any further I do want to separate MDMA out from some other compounds which are referred to as psychedelics and I recently did a podcast episode all about psilocybin and its therapeutic exploration and it's chemical basis Etc you can find that like all episodes at hubermanlab.com I also did an episode with expert guest Dr Robin Carhart Harris who's at University of California San Francisco who's pioneering a lot of the studies on the clinical application of psilocybin psilocybin and LSD are mainly going to increase serotonin activation in the brain in fact they very closely resemble serotonin itself and they activate What's called the 5ht2a or serotonin 5hd just stands for serotonin the 5ht 2A receptor to create very mystical type experiences they are considered classic psychedelics and are very introspective and as I described in those episodes are being explored extensively now for the treatment of major depression a different compound that's being used for the treatment of depression is ketamine I will do an entire episode all about ketamine ketamine is actually a n methodaspartate receptor blocker nmda receptor blocker that shouldn't mean anything to most of you but it is a dissociative anesthetic not unlike PCP what used to be called angel dust on the street ketamine is being used as a treatment for depression it is currently legal so unlike psilocybin and LSD which are granted breakthrough status for the study of depression but are not yet legal they are still illegal and of course as I mentioned earlier MDMA has breakthrough status but is still illegal ketamine is being used for the treatment of depression and it does so as its name suggests a dissociative anesthetic by creating a sense of dissociation from emotions okay now I raise this distinction between psilocybin and LSD which are mystical in their effects ketamine which is dissociative in its effects with MDMA which is an empathogen or sometimes called an anactogen but as an empathogen or an enactogen it's creating more affiliation it's affiliative okay so it's a very distinct compound and I think this is important to understand because when we hear the word psychedelic a lot of people tend to lump together LSD psilocybin and MDMA if you talk to researchers in these areas they will tell you that MDMA really isn't that much of a psychedelic it's an empathogen with stimulant properties and it also has the serotonergic component that makes it an empathogen or an actogen so MDMA is very different than the other psychedelics and my hunch is that over the next few years we will stop talking about MDMA as a psychedelic because it does not tend to produce visual hallucinations or auditory hallucinations of the sort that classic psychedelics do and in general it is more of a mood impacting drug than it is Mystical okay so we'll get into some of the brain networks and which ones are activated while under the influence of MDMA but I do think it's very important to segment out MDMA from the other so-called classic psychedelics and also segment it out from ketamine thanks to some really terrific studies both in animal models and in humans We Now understand a lot of what makes MDMA produce these incredibly unique effects and when I say unique I mean unique from drugs like psilocybin and LSD and ketamine and from methamphetamine for that matter and it's really the combination of big increases in dopamine and even bigger increases in serotonin that create a situation where people have more energy and yet despite having more energy they don't feel irritated they feel a lot of pleasure they seem to want to be in the state of having a lot of energy this will become important as we talk about anxiety and the anxiety symptoms of PTSD it also because of the big increases in serotonin produces a sense of emotional warmth towards others and towards oneself that's the empathogen component and for reasons that we still don't understand it seems to increase trust and the increases in trust turn out to be vital because as you will you will also learn later when we look at the clinical trials exploring MDMA for the treatment of PTSD the major effect of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD is not to cure PTSD but rather to make the therapy the talk therapy for PTSD much more effective this is a very important point in fact so important I'm going to repeat it at least three times during today's episode MDMA taken on its own does not cure PTSD MDMA can augment or boost the effects of talk therapy for PTSD and it does that through the engagement of specific neural circuits but before we talk about what those neural circuits are I want to emphasize that the increases in serotonin that MDMA produces seem to act on different receptors then the big increases in serotonin the LSD and psilocybin produce so if you listen to the episode that I did on psilocybin we haven't done yet one on LSD but the mechanisms are very similar for psilocybin and LSD whereby psilocybin and LSD very closely mimic the molecule serotonin itself but seem to have a more selective activation of just the so-called serotonin 2A receptor abbreviated 5ht2a and that leads to more interconnectedness between different brain areas more consideration of new possibilities about events from the past present and future and also the opening of so-called neuroplasticity of rewiring of neural connections that persist long after the psilocybin or LSD effects have worn off now MDMA can activate the serotonin 2A receptor but it seems that it largely activates the serotonin 1B receptor now what does that mean activation of the serotonin 1B receptor seems to be what gives MDMA its very strong impact on the neural circuits of the brain that relate to trust and to social engagement not just the willingness to engage socially and to confide in a therapist or another person but the intense desire to do so and when I say intense desire that takes us back to the dopamine system remember dopamine even though when increased in the brain can increase our mood it is largely responsible for increasing our sense of motivation and desire for something and to do something so the increase in dopamine that's created by MDMA seems to make people what I call forward Center of mass you know they want to do something they're very motivated to do something and the increases in serotonin acting on the serotonin 1B receptor seems to be what creates this desire to bond or create trust or to have a discussion of real things both things that are positive but also to explore things that are difficult and this I realize is going to be a little bit of a mind Bend for people to to understand but one of the key things that quality MDMA therapy consists of is not just having a very good rapport and communication with a therapist that's guiding the PTSD treatment but also Rapport and a willingness to engage in conversations with oneself yeah I think that most of us can relate to the fact that we have experiences some of which are hard some of which are great and everything in between trauma is I believe best defined by the words that a former guest on this podcast who's a world expert in trauma Paul Conte explained as trauma is an event that fundamentally changes the way that our brain works for the worse okay so not every bad event of our past is trauma but events that change the way that we think our emotional tone or our behavior in ways going forward that are not adaptive for us They don't serve us well either because they are highly distracting or because um they create anxiety or because they disrupt sleep or any number of different things that are maladaptive consequences that's what really defines trauma and when under the influence of MDMA because of those parallel increases in dopamine and serotonin people seem far more willing to both trust the therapists that they're talking about that trauma with but also to trust their own ability to quote unquote go internal and think about the challenging thing or things because oftentimes trauma can consist of many events not just one event and the thought patterns around that and the context around that and therein to be able to explore new possibilities to essentially rewire their relationship to that trauma so I promise that a little bit later we'll talk about the the direct application of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD but now I'd like to shift off of the chemical changes that MDMA produces and some of the subjective changes these increases in trust and pleasure and energy and emotional warmth to some of the brain circuits that are activated and Modified by MDMA use and then we will explore the toxicity issue and then we will explore the clinical studies of which I can promise you are extremely exciting but until we understand the neural circuit phenomena and of course until we consider the neurotoxicity issues I don't think those clinical findings can be appreciated in their full value but now I'd like to talk about what MDMA really does in the brain both in the short term while someone is under the influence of the drug and in the long term what sorts of neuroplastic or rewiring changes does MDMA produce and how can those be beneficial or perhaps not beneficial I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be in the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 so in order to understand what MDMA does to the human brain we need to take a step back and really Define the sorts of experiments that one could do so for instance you could take a person who's never ingested MDMA and put them into an fmri machine which is functional magnetic resonance imaging put them into the fmri machine and just have them sit there with their eyes closed what we would call resting functional connectivity or arresting State functional connectivity and simply look at how interconnected certain brain areas are which brain areas are active which brain areas are less active at rest this is an important thing to do not just to provide a baseline for understanding what the drug MDMA will subsequently do but also because it addresses What's called the default mode Network the default mode Network or dmn is the network that is active in our brains when we aren't really attending to anything specific outside us and we're not trying to think about anything specific or accomplish anything specific it actually relates to our sense of imagination and daydreaming it has a lot to do with our self-referencing you know what we're thinking about ourselves this may come as no surprise but if you're just sitting there on the bus or you know around the dinner table and you're not paying attention to what's going on in large part your brain is in this default mode Network and you're thinking about yourself okay so we can get a sense of what the default mode Network activation is we can get a sense of which brain areas are more or less active simply by putting somebody into an fmri machine then of course you could give somebody MDMA while they are in the fmri machine and see how the activation of different brain networks changes and then of course you could analyze how the default mode networks and other brain networks change in the days and weeks and even years after the drug has worn off so-called neuroplasticity effects what changed in a permanent or pervasive way okay so that's sort of one basic Paradigm for exploring the effects of drugs like MDMA on the brain the other way that you can explore the effects of MDMA on the brain is to ask people in the general population hey who out there is taking MDMA how many times have you taken it and come on into the laboratory and we will image your brain and compare people who have for instance taken MDMA zero times to people who have taken MDMA one time or five times or believe it or not there's some studies sitting right here in front of me on my desk of people who have taken MDMA more than 200 times and ask the same sorts of questions which brain areas are more or less active those Studies have been done as well and of course one can do studies where you give people different dosages of MDMA as well as giving people MDMA and then giving them specific stimuli meaning not just asking them to sit there in the fmri scanner with eyes closed looking at the resting state functional connectivity but also how the brain responds to the presentation of happy faces or sad faces or images of oneself or even images that recall memories of traumatic events and so on so fortunately all of those sorts of Studies have been done in humans and there are also a large number of studies in animal models exploring how the social activity of laboratory mice changes when they are under the effects of MDMA or even studies believe it or not on the effects of MDMA encephalopods cephalopods include octopuses as well as cuttlefish and other Aquatic animals that are known for having complex Behavior some people believe that the cephalopods are extremely intelligent you know the obsession with cephalopods is something that really intrigues me I actually used to have cuttlefish in my laboratory we did not put them on MDMA but there is a study that's been published in the journal current biology it's a cell Press Journal excellent Journal this is from Google Dolan's laboratory at Johns Hopkins school of medicine showing that if you give octopuses MDMA they like to spend more time with other octopuses than they do if they are not on MDMA and that might sound like kind of a um kind of a playful experiment just done uh in order to entertain oneself and the octopuses perhaps but actually in that study they identified the serotonin transporter in octopuses and show that it has a lot of homology similarity to human serotonin transporter receptors and so what that really speaks to is the fact that the pro-social effects of MDMA that are observed in mice and in humans and in octopuses all have a common basis which is the activation of more serotonin release in particular brain networks okay so that interesting study on octopuses aside I think what most of us are interested in is how MDMA impacts the brain and so I'm going to spell out the three major ways in which MDMA changes the activation of the brain in the short and long term and here I'm pooling across a number of different studies but one of the key sets of studies in this area comes from the what I consider very beautiful work of Harriet DeWitt Harriet DeWitt runs the human behavioral pharmacology lab in the department of Psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago in her laboratory has a long history of giving people certain drugs in very specific dosages and then measuring their effects on the brain using different types of Imaging including fmri and one particular study that I'll highlight is entitled effects of MDMA on sociability and neural responses to social threat and social reward so what the study looked at is how MDMA impacts people's perceptions of others emotional Expressions on their face what they found is that when people are on MDMA their response to threatening faces or other threatening stimuli is reduced and it's reduced in a very specific way which is reductions in activity of the amygdala the amygdala is a structure that some of you may be familiar with it is known to be involved in the threat detection systems or networks of the brain it is sometimes called the fear area of the brain although I want to caution people against assigning any one particular subjective experience to any one particular brain area the amygdala is actually a complex it's actually called the amygdaloid complex and has a lot of different sub areas and it's involved in a lot of things besides fear and threat detection nonetheless when people are under the influence of MDMA and you show them a face that is grimacing or would otherwise be rated as quite threatening they tend to rate it as less threatening in addition they tend to respond to happy faces or even slightly happy faces as more kind or more generous or happier than they would when they are not on MDMA again the faces that are being shown are not of people on MDMA that would be an interesting experiment but that's not what they did here what's Happening Here is people are being given MDMA and then they are raiding in a subjective way the friendliness or the level of threat that they detect in these facial expressions and of course they have extremes of friendly and threatening but then they also grade them right they titrate them so that they also have mildly threatening and mildly happy faces Etc so everything from a grin to a smirk to a giant smile everything from a from a sort of a you know somebody looking a little bit of scans at somebody to really you know wide-eyed and looking angry like they're you know gonna attack you and things of that sort so what's discovered in the study is that MDMA has a bi-directional effect on our perception of others emotions making people more likely to rate something as positive if it's initially positive or even a little bit positive and less likely to rate a threatening face as more threatening now one thing I have not mentioned thus far are the dosages of MDMA used in this and in other studies unfortunately despite the studies that we're going to talk about using a lot of different types of people different ages different Sexes so male and female located in different parts of the world even some with PTSD some not with PTSD Etc there's been fairly tight dosage control of MDMA in these studies it's not perfectly matched from study to study but it's pretty darn close which makes interpreting results across studies a lot easier for me and therefore for you the typical dosages of MDMA used in these neuroimaging studies and in the clinical studies of PTSD that we're going to talk about later range anywhere from 0.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight so for somebody like me I weigh 220 pounds that's 100 milligrams 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight would therefore be 150 milligrams in a single dose okay a dosage of one milligram per kilogram of body weight would mean 100 milligrams for my 100 kilograms okay somebody lighter than 100 kilograms would obviously take less MDMA in one of these studies but in general the range of MDMA that's been explored is 0.75 to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight the exception being in the clinical studies that we'll talk about a little bit later there's a tendency to explore both an initial dose of 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight so again for a hundred kilogram person that would be 150 milligrams or so and then a so-called booster of half that amount about 90 minutes to two and a half hours into the session so another 75 milligrams later and I should point out that there is not always the inclusion of the so-called booster and in some cases lower doses of MDMA such as the 0.75 milligrams per kilogram dosages are used why am I getting so into the details of dosages well if we are going to talk about toxicity of MDMA we absolutely have to talk about dosages because like any drug the toxicity of MDMA does scale with the dosage that's applied not just the frequency of MDMA use we hear a lot about that you know someone has taken MDMA one time or four times or 200 times we hear about frequency of use but rarely do we hear about the specific dosages that are taken in any one particular session so when we talk about the subjective effects or the brain networks that are activated when people take MDMA in general we're talking about dosages somewhere between 0.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight although typically you're going to see studies both clinical and more research explorative using anywhere from 1 to 1.5 milligrams of MDMA per kilogram of body weight so that's important to highlight I told you about the subjective effects of MDMA engaging the responses of people's faces but I didn't tell you about the brain areas that are responsible except for the reduction in amygdala activity now one of the key features of PTSD seems to be that there is a heightened connectivity between the amygdala and a brain area called the insula the insula is a brain area that's very important for something that's called interoception interoception is one's perception of our feelings both pure Sensations but also our emotional states and our feelings of well-being or lack of well-being for everything from our skin inward okay so that's interoception you actually can intercept now even though you're always intercepting a little bit you can intercept now to a great degree if you were to for instance close your eyes or simply focus on the contact points between your body and any surface that you happen to be contacting so maybe the backs of your legs against a chair or your feet against the floor or the bottoms of your shoes or sandals your nervous system is constantly sensing those contact points but normally they're not under your conscious awareness unless you direct Your interceptive Capacity to them which is just fancy nerd speak for saying you normally don't notice what's going on from your skin inward unless you focus on it that focus is interception it can be about the fullness of your gut it can be about how happy or sad you are it can be about how tired or alert you happen to feel but that's interception and it is distinctly different from exteriorception which is your ability and tendency to focus on things beyond the confines of your skin so this could be visual attention auditory attention it could be paying attention to events like birds flying by whether or not your Uber is showing up these kinds of things and we are always in a balance a push-pull of interoception and extra reception the insula is a brain area that is absolutely critical for interception so much so that it has a map of the complete body surface including our internal organs in other words if you put somebody into an fmri machine or you were to record from the insula with electrodes as has been done in humans many times now during the course of neurosurgery for other purposes what you would find is that if you stimulate neurons in one end of the insula the person will say oh you know I I feel something going on in my gut and on my left side and then as you were to March that stimulation across the insula you would find that they would now be paying attention to their legs or just to one leg or to their whole body or to the sensations in their face or their head so there's a systematic map of interoception in the insula and there are direct connections between the amygdala and the insula and the amygdala despite getting this reputation as just being a fear Center or a threat detection Center is actually part of a much larger set of networks that include inputs from the hippocampus an area of the brain that's involved in memory formation and Storage and what is observed is that people who have PTSD tend to have greater or rather stronger connections between the amygdala and the insula than is normally observed in people who do not have PTSD okay so there seems to be heightened input from the threat detection centers of the brain to this area of the brain the insula that is responsible for our sense of interception which provides a logical explanation for why people with PTSD often will feel the memory or sense the discomfort or just feel agitation or even other types of bodily Sensations like back pain or just perhaps just a sense within their body that's more generalized it doesn't even have to be pain doesn't even have to be negative but that's associated with the negative memory of some traumatic event or series of events okay so this is a really interesting brain Network that I should mention exists in everybody but that in people with PTSD seems to have heightened connectivity and those brain networks can be revealed by putting people with PTSD into functional Imaging machines getting them to recall a traumatic event or even looking at the resting state of connectivity between the amygdala and the insula so those experiments have been done and what's also been done is to give people 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of MDMA and to look at the connectivity between the amygdala and the insula and between the hippocampus the amygdala and the insula and so what's observed over time in people that have been given MDMA and this is a very important and and have done therapy for PTSD both before during and after the drug there's a weakening of connections between the amygdala and the insula and that scales very directly with the relief of symptoms from PTSD so this is really exciting because it's one thing to see a brain Network get activated or inactivated or you say okay in one person a certain connection between threat centers and the interceptive centers of the brain was let's say arbitrary units let's say it was level eight out of ten for that person right these things are normalized for a particular person and then after taking MDMA and doing PTSD therapy it was five out of ten or four out of ten that's a good experiment but what's far more powerful is to observe that in that patient or that person and then to see a change that's perhaps less dramatic so a shift from 8 out of 10 to 7 out of ten in another person and to see less shift in brain connectivity in the same network and then perhaps in the person that went from full-blown PT PSD to full remission of PTSD something that believe it or not has been observed in single sessions with MDMA if that person demonstrates an even greater reduction in the connections between the amygdala and the incilla well then that gives even more confidence that this connection between the amygdala and the insula is actually perhaps causally related to the reduction in symptoms of PTSD or even if it's just correlated with reduction in symptoms of PTSD the fact that the degree of reduction of connection of this circuit scales with the reduction in clinically relevant symptoms that's a very powerful finding because it moves things away from Pure correlation although this brain area is active or less active over time and you know this person has more or fewer symptoms of PTSD to something that starts to look like a mechanistic and logical framework for understanding PTSD as well as the effects of MDMA and for understanding how changes in the brain underlie relief from PTSD okay so again even if you just could grasp the idea that you have a brain area the amygdala that's involved in threat detection and it provides inputs to another brain area called the insula which is involved in this thing called interoception and that reductions in those connections between the amygdala and the insula scale with or correlate with reductions in PTSD symptoms as a consequence of people taking MDMA so if you have that under your mental belt I promise you you understand far more about how MDMA impacts the brain in the short and long term the 99.9 percent of people out there however it's also important you understand a few other things that MDMA does to the brain as well as what it doesn't do to the brain first of all classic psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD as I mentioned earlier are known to create more lateral connectivity between different areas of the so-called neocortex and these are long-lasting changes that are thought to underlie both some of the relief from major depression but also some of the enhanced creativity and some of the other things that have been observed with psilocybin treatment and again if you're interested in psilocybin treatments and psilocybin itself please check out the episode that I did on psilocybin and the guest episode with Dr Robin Carhartt Harris those episodes like all other episodes of The huberman Lab podcast can be found at hubermanlab.com it's a fully searchable site so you can put keywords into the search function it will take you to specific time stamps every episode is time stamps you can navigate to topics of particular interest to you feel free to go there and listen to those episodes about psilocybin MDMA by contrast does not seem to produce long lasting increases in lateral connectivity between those same brain networks probably because it impacts a different serotonin receptors it does however seem to change resting state functional connectivity Within These limbic structures like the amygdala and related structures that are associated with threat detection now this is interesting and it actually was highlighted very nicely in a study I'll provide a link to in our show note caption which actually has Dr Robin Carter Harris as the first author so not only has he done incredible work on psilocybin and LSD and DMT in Ayahuasca in his laboratory but also on MDMA and the particular study I have in mind here showed that people who take MDMA at more or less the dosage that we talked about earlier report Mark increases in positive mood as well as decreased blood flow to the amygdala and hippocampus so again these threat detection centers of the brain and brain areas associated with memory and those changes are seen both while under the influence of MDMA and afterwards when the brain is simply at rest so it really does appear that MDMA creates neuroplasticity that changes the overall level of activation of these threat detection networks and their connections to memory systems in a way that's pervasive over time and that doesn't require any particular probe with a negative stimulus I'll translate to English what that means is that during the MDMA session people report feeling less threatened more pro-social towards others more empathic towards others and themselves and then after the session they have less of a threat response to memories that before the session were more troubling and those changes in the brain do seem to be pervasive so there are both short-term and long-term effects of MDMA all of which point in the direction of lowered levels of threat detection heightened levels of positivity pro-social components of the brain more active threat detection centers of the brain less active now earlier we talked about MDMA as a drug that potently increases dopamine and even more potently increases serotonin largely acting through this serotonin 1B receptor now without getting into too many more details before moving on to issues of toxicity around MDMA I do want to touch on what I think is perhaps the finest of the animal model studies of MDMA that explored which brain networks and which chemical that is serotonin or dopamine is responsible for say the motivational components of MDMA versus the pro-social effects of MDMA and then it also raises a really important point which I haven't mentioned yet in this episode which is the role of oxytocin something that many of you have perhaps heard of the paper that I'm going to describe is from the laboratory of Dr Robert malenka he's a colleague of mine at Stanford University School of Medicine Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences he is both a Pioneer and luminary in the field of neuroplasticity of how the brain wires and forms memories and can change itself over time in response to experience as well as the study of drugs of abuse as well as the study of drugs like MDMA and now additional compounds that can provide therapeutic support in certain conditions the study which I will provide a link to in the show note caption is entitled distinct neural mechanisms for the pro-social and rewarding properties of MDMA and I'm just going to summarize the major results of this study it's a study that was done on mice and I realized that a lot of people will hear that and think ah what relevance does that have to humans but when thinking about the effects of dopamine and serotonin in the types of circuits that we've been talking about thus far these circuits that are subcortical as we refer to them so these are limbic circuits these are hypothalamic circuits these are what are called mesolymbic circuits these are all names for circuits that are highly conserved between mice and humans and so results in mice really do translate quite well to results in humans at least insofar as the effects of MDMA and which neurochemicals are involved is concerned so what they found in the study using a huge array of beautiful techniques such as inactivation of specific brain areas activation of specific brain areas drug antagonists to prevent oxytocin function or drug antagonist to prevent specific receptors involved in the serotonin pathway lots and lots of tools in their toolkit what they found is that MDMA causing the release of dopamine is what really establishes the rewarding effects of an experience this isn't really a surprise we've known that MDMA just like cocaine or Methamphetamine or Adderall for that matter or Vyvanse for that matter creates big increases in dopamine that tend to couple an experience with a sense of reward and lead to changes in the neural circuitry that make the animal or human more likely to seek out that same experience again okay these are the rewarding or sometimes called reinforcing properties of dopamine that take place in the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway if you want to learn about mesolimic reward Pathways and dopamine and how they control everything from your level of motivation to your tendency to procrastinate or overcome procrastination I've done two episodes about dopamine you can simply go to hubermanlab.com put dopamine into the search function and you'll find at least two episodes on that topic and you'll also find a number of different tools related to how one can better regulate their own patterns of dopamine release for sake of motivation Etc so MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase reward to a particular experience what's the experience well this paper beautifully parses the fact that it is serotonin release within a structure called the nucleus accumbens which is part of the reward pathway which is rewarding the experience of social interaction now they do this by putting mice in arenas where they have the option of either spending time with other mice or not spending time with other mice and blocking the activation of certain brain areas and again using drug antagonists Etc and what they find is that it really is the activation of the serotonin 1B receptor in the nucleus of Commons by MDMA that leads to this pro-social effect of MDMA so that's really nice to know because there's always been this conundrum of okay psilocybin and LSD are basically like serotonin they activate the serotonin 2A receptor MDMA has this huge serotonergic component tons of Serotonin released when one takes MDMA but very different effects in the short and long term very different subjective effects very different patterns of change activity in the brain in the short and long term well that's because MDMA is activating the serotonin-1b receptor not the serotonin 2A receptor and it's doing so in a completely different set of brain networks as is LSD and psilocybin so what happens when an animal or a person takes MDMA is that social connection is strongly rewarded and reinforced making social connection more likely after the drug wears off now that's one component of social connection but in addition people who take MDMA in the clinical therapeutic setting for the treatment of PTSD often report feeling more empathy and compassion for themselves during the session but also for long periods of time maybe even indefinitely after the session so it really seems that the addition of this huge release of Serotonin by MDMA on top of the release of dopamine sets in motion two parallel circuits one for rewarding something anything that's the dopamine component and then fortunately because the increase in serotonin caused by MDMA increases empathy and sociability for and with others but also for oneself the motivation that's reinforced that's wired into the brain seems to be a motivation to perceive others as more kind but also to be kinder to oneself now I realize that for some of you who are listening to this you're probably saying well of course right you know serotonin is pro-social and dopamine is motivation so you put the two together and people become more motivated to be social and kinder to themselves ah but it didn't necessarily have to be that way right it is very hard to go from a statement like drug a produces effects b c and d to neurochemicals b c and d cause motivation and sociability and therefore when you take that drug you're going to get all of that stuff in fact we have to go back to our understanding the MDMA despite causing a big increase in serotonin also causes huge increases in dopamine and it does so with this molecule that is methamphetamine now methamphetamine is not known to be a pro-social drug in fact a study I just referred to as well as some human Studies have explored how the application of methamphetamine so not MDMA but pure methamphetamine impacts social interactions and what it does to social interactions it's very profound it dramatically reduces one's tendency to engage in social interaction so this really speaks to the poly pharmacology as it's called of MDMA the fact that serotonin and dopamine are released together has distinctly different effects than if just dopamine or just serotonin is increased so much so that it's worth taking a step back and talking about another class of drugs which dramatically increases serotonin which are the ssris The Selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors ssris such as fluoxetine Prozac as well as Zoloft and of course there are many other accessories out there citalopram Etc they block the reuptake of Serotonin and thereby lead to net increases in the amount of Serotonin and yet those drugs are not known to create even close to the same sorts of effects as MDMA in fact there have been human and animal studies showing that if you give somebody an SSRI prior to them taking MDMA you actually block the pro-social and empathogenic effects of MDMA now you might say why in the world would that be aren't these drugs just increasing serotonin and the increase in serotonin is pro-social ETC ah well that speaks to the complexity of all this poly pharmacology and the fact that it's really the activation of Serotonin at particular receptors in this case the serotonin 1B receptor in particular brain areas in this case the nucleus accumbens a brain area associated with motivation and reward that largely explains the effects of MDMA in making people and animals and octopuses included for that matter more pro-social and more empathic towards themselves it's not just an issue of raising the levels of one neurochemical it's really about raising levels of a particular neurochemical acting in particular receptors in particular brain areas and in the case of MDMA the fact that there's also dopamine increased in those very same brain areas right I don't think I mentioned this before but the nucleus accumbens is part of that mesolimbic reward pathway that is essentially establishing a reward for whatever is happening at the moment so the way to conceptualize MDMA and its effects on the brain both subjectively and mechanistically is that it's an empathogen for which empathy and social connection is very strongly reinforced while under the influence of the drug and in a way so intense and Powerful that those neural networks get stronger and persist in being more active for long periods of time after the drug has worn off I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the so-called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits and cognitive and physical performance element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams that's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes and while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if I've been sweating a lot and certainly I drink element in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of sweat setting if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lmnt.com huberman now one of the things that's been explored in both the animal literature and the human literature is that MDMA doesn't just increase dopamine and doesn't just increase serotonin but it also profoundly increases levels of oxytocin release in the brain now oxytocin is considered what's called a neuro hormone because it acts as both a neurotransmitter or I guess if we were going to be really specific we'd say a neuromodulator because it tends to modulate the activity of a bunch of other circuits and a hormone how can we say it's a hormone or a modulator or transmitter well hormonal effects tend to be effects that act not just locally but on many sites within the brain and body as well and oxytocin is known to do that as well as to work locally so that's why we call a neuro hormone it activates neurons and is associated with neural networks related to pair bonding both between parent and child both mother and child and father and child or caretaker and child not just biological parent as well as bonding between friends bonding between lovers and it's thought to actually be involved in the process that is the painful process of breaking of bonds when people are no longer available to us as caretakers or as partners either by way of breakup death departure Etc in fact there are even data suggesting that humans can have strong oxytocin responses to their pets in particular dogs and their dogs can have strong oxytocin patterns of release in response to their owners I think for any dog lovers or dog owners certainly includes me I'm raising my hand that comes as no surprise anyone that's ever had to put down a dog or has lost a dog and hear no disrespect to the cat owners but I'm just referring to the studies that have been done on humans and dogs you can certainly relate to the incredible pain of that loss oxytocin is thought to be involved in bonding between people and other creatures as well as the breaking of those bonds MDMA is known to powerfully increase oxytocin release in fact there's a really nice study on this done in humans this is a study I'll provide a link to in the show note captions entitled plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans nowadays oxytocin is available by nasal inhaler to be honest I don't know the legality around it I don't know if it's a gray Market or but what I'm about to tell you will basically discourage you from wanting to take it because what they found in the study was people given either 0.75 or 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of MDMA experienced increases in oxytocin however it was only the group that took 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of MDMA that experienced the really big significant changes in oxytocin and when I say really big really highly statistically significant what they observed is that in the placebo group because of course they include a placebo group the amount of circulating oxytocin was 18.6 picograms per milliliter which to you probably means nothing and to me also sort of means nothing because those units of oxytocin can't be directly related to any kind of direct experience of feeling bonded or not bonded that's just a number but nonetheless it provides a baseline to compare to the average levels of oxytocin in the bloodstream of people that were given 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of MDMA which is 83.7 picograms per milliliter that equates to nearly a five-fold increase in the amount of circulating oxytocin when people are under the influence of MDMA now this study had a bunch of different conditions not just MDMA of different doses not just placebo they also had people take oxytocin by nasal spray which we know can change levels of circulating oxytocin and indeed when measured in the study it did change levels of circulating oxytocin and the end point in the study was to have people give subjective ratings of their feelings of connectedness to one another as well as rate and here I'm just drawing directly from the paper of how much they like the feeling how much they felt high they measure their heart rate their systolic pressure their diastolic blood pressure Etc and they looked at how social people felt they looked at how insightful people felt and the key takeaway from the study for sake of our discussion here today is that it does not again it does not appear that the increases in oxytocin produced by taking MDMA are the source of the pro-social effects of MDMA and that's also what was found in the animal studies of MDMA where in those studies mice were given MDMA at comparable doses the doses were a little bit higher than used in the human studies but at comparable doses big increases in oxytocin were observed increases in sociability of those mice were observed just as they are in humans that take MDMA but in those mice they were also given a drug to block the oxytocin receptor and lo and behold no changes in sociability were observed in humans that take oxytocin by nasal spray you can see big increases in oxytocin that's not surprising gets across the blood-brain barrier oxytocin goes up and levels of sociability do not increase so what this points to is a situation where MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase motivation and to reward something what gets rewarded well what gets rewarded is the serotonin activation of particular brain networks associated with sociability and the dramatic increases in oxytocin that are very very real when people take MDMA do not appear to underlie any of the known short or long-term subjective effects of MDMA now a conclusion like that needs to have a caveat and the caveat is that as far as we know the big increases in oxytocin that are produced by MDMA aren't doing anything for the sorts of effects that we've been talking about here sociability empathy Etc but there could be other effects of oxytocin that we're just not aware of that said the data from both animal models and in humans really point to the fact that the increases in oxytocin that are produced by MDMA are not directly related to any of the short and long-term effects of MDMA that we are most familiar with namely motivation sociability increase empathy or the long-standing changes in neural circuitry that underlie for instance reduce threat detection or reduce connectivity between threats detection centers of the brain and in terreception so is the big increase in oxytocin produced by MDMA completely irrelevant in the context of this discussion we don't know it appears that it's not very relevant is oxytocin a meaningless molecule right after all they gave these people nasal infusions of oxytocin oxytocin and went way up they didn't observe anything very interesting or significant in the context of sociability but we do know that oxytocin can play a powerful role in pair bonding and in human human animal bonding of various kinds from other experiments that have been done so I don't want to diminish the incredible power that oxytocin has in our brains and bodies but it doesn't appear that the MDMA induced increases in oxytocin which are enormous have much to do with anything related to the value of MDMA as a treatment for PTSD or for its subjective effects on empathy sociability or any of those other factors either now perhaps the one caveat to that is that hair Harriet Dewitt's laboratory which I referred to earlier has looked at how variations in oxytocin receptor genes vary between people so it turns out that some people have an allele a basically a version of the oxytocin receptor that is different from other people that makes oxytocin work differently and actually less effectively in activating certain brain networks and it does appear that when those people take MDMA they actually it experience less of a pro-social effect of the drug now that spits in the face of everything I just said about oxytocin not being involved in the effects of MDMA on pro-sociability and empathy I think the bulk of the data really points to the fact that it's the serotonin increases combined with the dopamine increases caused by MDMA that lead to most of the understood effects and that oxytocin if it's playing a role is going to play a more minor role let's talk about the safety and potential neurotoxicity of MDMA and here I really want to highlight that our discussion today is couched in a discussion about the application of pure MDMA to animals or humans in the context of laboratory or clinical studies this is really important to point out because I would be remiss if I didn't note that there is a lot of recreational use of MDMA in fact it was the recreational use of MDMA in the 1980s but really that took off even exploded in the 1990s with so-called Rave culture that created the massive attention on illegality of MDMA and put the drug enforcement agencies onto MDMA as a drug that they wanted to and indeed do restrict in fact just today in anticipation of this episode I put MDMA into the search function on Google and clicked news and there were at least two reports of major MDMA seizures and bus so again I want to highlight the fact that MDMA is still illegal to possess or sell and certainly to traffic I also want to highlight the fact that nowadays all recreational drugs but certainly MDMA included are often in fact very often contaminated with fentanyl and while fentanyl has certain clinical uses fentanyl is highly deadly the current estimates are as much as 60 percent maybe even 80 percent of drugs that are sold on the gray Market are being repackaged or reformulated with fentanyl and there have been a lot of fentanyl related deaths both in kids and adults so the sourcing of MDMA is extremely important and the safety issues simply cannot be overlooked and I say that not to protect me I say that to protect you right the last thing any of us want is for someone to take a compound thinking it's one compound and it contains another compound and I'm getting hurt or even dying and that is happening a lot a lot and it is certainly happening a lot for people that think that they're buying MDMA the use of MDMA in the laboratory or in the clinical setting with pure MDMA has also been explored for the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA so how would methamphetamine and MDMA be neurotoxic well that's because they increase dopamine in the case of methamphetamine and dopamine and serotonin in the case of MDMA and they do so to a very high degree the big increases in dopamine and serotonin but in particular the big increases in dopamine tend to promote electrical activity of other neurons remember these are after all neuromodulators they modulate up or down the activity of other neurons and dopamine tends to modulate the activity of other neurons up so dopamine itself is not neurotoxic but when a lot of dopamine is released it is neurotoxic and it's well known that even a single dose of methamphetamine can be neurotoxic not just for dopamine neurons but for other types of neurons as well including serotonergic neurons put differently we know that the brains of people that take methamphetamine degenerate to a smaller or to a large degree depending on how often they take the drug how potent the drug is and whether or not they combine it with other drugs and yes if you heard that combining caffeine with amphetamines can increase the neurotoxicity of amphetamines such as methamphetamine that is true if you've heard that taking caffeine within the hours or same day as MDMA can increase the toxicity of MDMA that does appear to be true based on animal studies now there are not a lot of studies looking at the toxicity of MDMA in humans but there are a few there are also studies looking at the toxicity of MDMA in animal models including non-human primate models now this is a very complex literature a lot of results not all over the place but they're scattered in a number of ways first of all some of the animal Studies have used dosages of MDMA as high as two milligrams per kilogram of body weight as high as three milligrams per kilogram of body weight and even in upwards of that but even for the animal studies that used a range of dosages from 0.75 to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight there is some evidence that in laboratory Miser rats there can be some loss of serotonergic tone in the brains of animals that have been administered MDMA now notice I said serotonergic tone I didn't say serotonin neurons because of the way that MDMA Works in encouraging or promoting big releases in dopamine big releases in serotonin it's not surprising that if the animals that were given MDMA are subsequently sacrificed say later that day or the next day or maybe even a week or two weeks later and those brains are stained for proteins that are related to the synthesis or release of Serotonin it's not surprising that there would be reductions in those sorts of proteins right after all a lot of dopamine and serotonin is released and it can be depleted but I should point out depletion of a neuromodulator in the short term is not the same thing as depletion of that neuromodulator in the long term nor is it the same as loss of the neurons that release dopamine and serotonin itself so there are data pointing to the fact that repeated administration of MDMA at dosages that are very much within lines with what we're talking about today 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight can lower total amounts of Serotonin or other proteins in the serotonin synthesis pathway or dopamine or proteins that are in the dopamine synthesis pathway in specific areas of the brain related to reinforcement related to mood related to motivation Etc however the primate studies or I should say the non-human primate studies which are the sorts of animal studies that most closely mimic what one expects to see in the human brain because after all mice and the effects of these drugs and mice do translate to humans but it's thought that non-human primates provide a model that's far more similar to humans there the data start to get kind of complicated in a way that suggests that MDMA might not be as neurotoxic as is thought based on the rodent studies and this gets into a whole history of back and forth between different Laboratories and governing bodies who are trying to keep MDMA legal as well as people such as the Sasha Shoguns of the world and people in the therapy community that are excited about the potential for MDMA becoming legal for the treatment of PTSD and it really centers around one or two studies both of which were published in very high profile journals and the one that I'll highlight because the results are now very clear and conclusive is a study that was published back in 2002 which was entitled severe dopaminergic neurotoxicity in primates after a common recreational dose regimen of MDMA or ecstasy this paper was published in the journal science which is one of the three Apex journals for publishing scientific research so there's science nature and cell those are the top top journals most stringent journals to get scientific manuscripts into the paper received a lot of attention because as you can imagine based on the title it suggested that even recreational doses of ecstasy even if it's pure ecstasy and it doesn't have contamination from additional methamphetamine or other things in it is neurotoxic to serotonergic and or dopaminergic neurons this is largely where MDMA got the reputation for quote unquote putting holes in your brain however this study came under a lot of scrutiny for a couple of reasons first of all and I'm certainly not saying this but it was argued that the authors of the study were perhaps trying to prevent the legalization of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD as far as I know there's no direct evidence that that statement is true but you will actually find that in some of the scientific journals in fact I was able to find a an editorial that was published in the biomedical journal in 2003 which argued somehow that Dr riccarte was accused of quote rushing his results into print because of legislation designed to curb ecstasy use before U.S Congress so you know there were some uh connotations or I'd rather there were some strong suggestions that there was a political backing to trying to get this study done quickly and into print and so forth I don't think that ever really got resolved what did get resolved however is that the very study in question was retracted okay so the authors themselves published a letter of retraction that unfortunately is not as well recognized as the paper that stimulated this idea that MDMA is neurotoxic in primates and keep in mind that we are human primates non-human primates being the closest model to human primates that we are aware of but to make a long story short there were some issues of labeling of MDMA versus other drugs in the laboratory there were some issues of mislabeling all of which were eventually acknowledged by the authors of the study and they concluded in fact they verified based on some very detailed analysis that what these monkeys were injected with was not actually MDMA but rather was methamphetamine itself so what's not often acknowledged is the retraction of the paper on neurotoxicity and unfortunately the neurotoxicity issue is often what's mentioned now keep in mind there are studies in rodents showing neurotoxicity of MDMA perhaps even at recreational doses but to date at least to my knowledge there don't seem to be any data in either non-human primates or in humans showing toxicity of MDMA at clinically relevant doses provided it is pure MDMA I want to be very clear I'm not saying that if you can get pure MDMA that you should take it or that it won't be neurotoxic certainly we can expect that because of the huge known variation in dopamine receptors in serotonin receptors and of course because of the known interactions between MDMA and other compounds in particular caffeine but also drugs such as cocaine or other stimulants that some people might experience more toxicity to a given dose of MDMA compared to somebody else and there's really no way to detect that susceptibility to neurotoxicity now what we do know is that there are people in the general population that have taken a lot of MDMA anywhere from 1 to 200 or sometimes even in excess of 400 doses of MDMA and they're now our studies that have explored the neurotoxicity and perhaps even more importantly the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of taking MDMA either zero times one time five times forty times 200 times etc etc and one of the what I would consider Landmark studies in this area is a study entitled residual neurocognitive features of long-term ecstasy users with minimal exposure to other drugs and those words with minimal exposure to other drugs is really key in the context of this conversation because as I mentioned before interactions between drugs what's called polypharmacology can create neurotoxicity it's unclear if MDMA is neurotoxic but we know methamphetamine on its own is neurotoxic we also know that people often will combine MDMA and methamphetamine we also know that a lot of so-called MDMA out there is mostly methamphetamine with only a little bit of MDMA so a study of the sort that I'm about to describe where it is essentially confirmed that people were taking pure MDMA and not taking any other drugs is of immense value this study has been a little bit controversial in fact I've talked about it before I talked about the Joe Rogan podcast I've talked about it briefly with a guest on this podcast Dr Nolan Williams who's a triple board certified physician psychiatrist and neurologist at Stanford School of Medicine and it's an interesting study and a little bit controversial because it relied on a population of people who have taken MDMA anywhere from one to two hundred times and who've not taken any other drugs including caffeine and the population in mind here is a population of people living in Utah who self-identify as members of the Church of Latter-day Saints sometimes referred to as Mormons sometimes referred to as LDS or of the Church of Latter-day Saints the Church of Latter-day Saints as I understand does not allow for taking of certain compound certain drugs certain certainly most recreational drugs alcohol even caffeine and I'm sure there's some variation on some of those themes depending on where people live and the certain communities that they happen to be in I am in no way shape or form um declaring that I'm an expert on Latter-Day Saints I have a couple of friends who are LDS happen to be very nice people as far as I know they were not the people in this study but this study really emphasized ecstasy users they're called who have not taken other drugs who self-identify as LDS and the major takeaway of this study was that for moderate meaning people who have taken ecstasy anywhere from 22 to 50 times in their lifetime as well as heavy users of MDMA so these are people who have taken MDMA anywhere from 660 to 450 times in their lifetime there was little evidence of decreased cognitive performance in standard assays for cognitive performance now there were some effects showing poorer here I'm quoting from the findings poor strategic self-regulation quote possibly reflecting increased impulsivity however when you see a conclusion like that you should immediately be thinking chicken versus egg right it could be that people that are more impulsive and that have less strategic self-regulation are more likely to take ecstasy 450 times you could conclude that or you could conclude that people who have taken ecstasy 75 times or 25 times Etc are degrading their levels of self-control and thereby increasing impulsivity the direction of the effect is not known these are purely correlations nonetheless this study and a few others like it really stand as our best evidence believe it or not as to how ecstasy taken many times because after all these people are taken anywhere from 22 to 450 doses of ecstasy in their lifetime is producing severe detriments in cognitive performance and that simply does not appear to be the case now unfortunately there are no data looking at the brains of these individuals looking at for instance which brain structures are active or less active or perhaps even looking at levels of Serotonin or dopamine all things that can be done with positron emission tomography Imaging functional MRI Etc hopefully those studies will be done in the not too distant future but if we were to just take a step back from all the data the data in mice in rats and non-human primates the retraction of the study in non-human primates which showed that the primates that showed neurodegeneration were not given MDMA as it was thought by the researchers but rather as later was acknowledged we're actually given methamphetamine and we take into account these moderate and heavy users of MDMA who as far as we know are being honest and haven't taken any other drugs and we look at the clinical studies where people who have never taken MDMA are given one or two or three defined doses of pure MDMA we'll talk about those studies in a moment I think the Gestalt the top Contour the overall view of those studies is that provided it as pure MDMA and provided the individual is not consuming other drugs which have the potential to be neurotoxic and provided that it's being done in a controlled clinical setting the risk for toxicity seems quite a bit lower than the popular press has promoted and yet there is still the risk of neurotoxicity if people are taking high doses of MDMA or taking it very frequently or certainly if they are taking it in conjunction with other drugs or or I should say and or taking MDMA in settings that can promote neurotoxicity and the settings I'm referring to are any settings in which blood pressure or body temperature have the propensity to be greatly increased every study in mice in non-human primates and in humans in which MDMA is administered has observed significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate MDMA is after all a psychostimulant it's a sympathomimetic talked about sympathomimetics and what that means in the episode on Adderall and Vyvanse and ADHD but basically it's ramping up the activity of the sympathetic nervous system which is your fight or flight system okay this is why people who take these drugs get big pupils you know big pupils of the eyes that's why they feel agitated they want to talk a lot they feel like they want to move a lot that's why people take it to dance at Raves Etc but when people take sympathomimetics whether or not it's MDMA or amphetamine or cocaine or even caffeine there's an increase in blood pressure and heart rate but also body temperature and if that's done in an environment in which there's very little temperature regulation so people aren't for instance drinking enough fluids and electrolytes it's very hot in the room you can get neurotoxicity based on temperature effects and that's because serotonin and dopamine also act on the so-called medial pre-optic area of the hypothalamus which is involved in temperature regulation if you're curious about temperature regulation I covered a lot of that in the episodes of the Hebrew and Lab podcast on deliberate coal exposure and deliberate heat exposure this is an area I used to work on many years ago as a research scientist before moving on to other topics to research in my laboratory big increases in body temperature are not good the body and in particular your brain can tolerate decreases in body temperature that are pretty robust and you can still stay safe you're not going to kill neurons but even an increase of three or four degrees in body temperature can start to kill off neurons so when thinking about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA the conditions that is the environmental conditions the behavioral conditions under which somebody takes MDMA are vitally important at least important I would argue as any other compounds they might be ingesting with MDMA so that's something really serious to consider so if somebody says MDMA puts holes in your brain you would be correct in being skeptical or at least giving them some counter Arguments for that statement but if somebody says MDMA is not toxic well then you would be equally valid in saying ah wait but we need to think about the conditions under which MDMA is being taken is it pure MDMA or is it mostly methamphetamine in which case it would be very toxic is it MDMA alone or in conjunction with caffeine within that same 24-hour period is it MDMA while moving around a lot or being outdoors or being in an environment perhaps a rave or dance type environment where temperature is going up well in that case it could be very neurotoxic so pharmacology of MDMA counts but so does poly pharmacology the ingestion of other compounds not just during the MDMA session but also in the 24 hours before and after that MDMA session and behaviors will certainly impact temperature which will impact whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic or not and despite my efforts I couldn't find out whether or not the LDS Community has officially sanctioned the use of MDMA certainly that's one possibility but I have no evidence for that or rather whether or not certain people within the LDS Community have allowed themselves given themselves permission to use MDMA and they are not using other drugs what I do understand to be the case is that people within the LDS Community are discouraged from using drugs like caffeine or cocaine or alcohol and this particular population of people that was explored in this study self-identify as LDS and self-identify as having taken MDMA anywhere from 22 to 450 times but where they got permission for that whether or not it was from someone else or from themselves I do not know what I do know is that within the acknowledgments of the paper there's actually a thank you to the person that identified this quote unique population for our study so I welcome you to take a look at the paper and if any of you know more about if and how a particular subgroup within the LDS Community is allowed to take MDMA perhaps you want to put those in the comment section on YouTube before moving to our discussion about what MDMA is doing and the effects that people are seeing in the clinical studies for the treatment of PTSD which by the way are extremely exciting I can't wait to share these data with you I do want to touch on something that anyone who's heard about MDMA or perhaps used MDMA is familiar with and that's the so-called crash that people experience after MDMA there are a lot of myths about the post-mdma crash and there's a lot of lore out there on the internet about how to offset the crash and a lot of lore about how to prevent the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA earlier we talked about some of the major points around offsetting neurotoxicity so certainly making sure that any MDMA that one takes is in the legal clinical setting that it's therefore pure MDMA right that it's not cut with other things which certainly can increase toxicity controlling the temperature of one's environment restricting caffeine intake at least on the day of MDMA ingestion but certainly the day before and the day after would be advantageous well simply because of the way that caffeine and activation of the adenosine receptor as well as caffeine's effects on dopamine receptors can interact with the potential again potential neurotoxicity of MDMA but the crash that one experiences after MDMA is actually a phenomenon very common to the crash that one experiences after ingestion of any type of stimulant cocaine amphetamine Etc and the crash that we're referring to is a drop in mood increase in lethargy feelings of lack of motivation many people have wrongly assumed that the crash was due to quote unquote depletion of Serotonin or depletion of dopamine or maybe even death of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons and while certainly that could be the case it's very unlikely that that would be the case in the immediate 24 or 48 hours after MDMA ingestion that said you will see protocols that people put out on the internet such as oh you know after taking MDMA you should take a bunch of you know 5-HTP or other precursors to serotonin or dopamine which come in amino acid forms so L-tryptophan for instance is the amino acid precursor to serotonin it's in the serotonin synthesis pathway you'll hear that people will take l-tyrosine which is the amino acid precursor to dopamine as a way to try and buffer or increase dopamine during the so-called period of the crash there's really no evidence that any of those things can be beneficial and there is actually some reason to believe that it might be detrimental because if anything taking L-tryptophan and taking l-tyrosine would actually further deplete serotonin and dopamine so the logic there is simply not very good what is clear however is that MDMA can cause not just profound increases in dopamine serotonin and oxytocin but that anytime there's a big increase in dopamine there is going to be a post-dopominergic increase in prolactin release and prolactin is a hormone sometimes considered a neural hormone but it's really a hormone that's involved in a lot of things milk let down in lactating women it's involved in setting the refractory period to sexual arousal and erection and ejaculation in males after ejaculation it's involved in lots of different functions in the brain and body including the laying down of body fat stores and it's also associated with increases in lethargy decreases in dopamine this is why drugs that increase dopamine are known to decrease prolactin at least in the short term this is wise drugs like cabergoline for instance that increase dopamine are used as ways to suppress prolactin now MDMA ingestion is known to dramatically increase prolactin and people are starting to realize that it perhaps is the increase in prolactin that occurs both during and for some period of time probably hours or days after ingestion of MDMA that leads to at least some components of the so-called crash that feeling of lethargy and lack of motivation maybe diminished mood Etc and for that reason some people have started to explore the use of things like p5p which is essentially a metabolite of vitamin B6 which is known to suppress prolactin as a way to try and buffer some of that crash to my knowledge there are no human data yet exploring the use of p5p or other vitamin B6 derivatives or capergoline or things of that sort to reduce prolactin in a controlled standardized clinical trial kind of manner but I've spoken to some of the clinicians that are using MDMA legally within the context of the treatment of PTSD and this is an area that's starting to receive some additional attention so I just mentioned it briefly here because for instance there's a lot of ideas out there that people should be taking L-tryptophan they should be taking l-tyrosine they should be taking magnesium other things Etc after taking MDMA in order to recover from the post-mdma crash more quickly but it's really the increase in prolactin which speaks most directly to the subjective effects of the so-called crash so by my read of the mechanisms of MDMA the neurochemicals it releases the neural hormones that it promotes the release of prolactin in particular this p5p suppression of prolactin is perhaps the one that's most intriguing and that really has any kind of mechanistic basis so I promise that going forward as the scientists and clinicians that are using MDMA for the treatment of PTSD and other conditions such as alcohol use disorder Etc start to explore the use of post-mdma session p5p and other modes of suppressing prolactin for the hours and days after MDMA promise to update you on those findings throughout today's episode I've been referring to clinical studies that is clinical trials exploring the use of MDMA in order to augment treatment for PTSD so let's just take a moment and talk about what PTSD is PTSD is post-traumatic stress disorder trauma is anything that modifies the brain to function less well going forward you know physical trauma you can have emotional trauma typically PTSD is used to refer to emotional trauma caused by either single events so you can imagine you know car accident sexual assault these could be first person experiences so things that happen to somebody that leads to trauma and then PTSD these can also be third person events where someone observes something that is traumatic to them maybe somebody being killed dismembered any number of different things that could be very traumatic in the immediate and long term and of course PTSD need not be caused only by single event traumas but by multiple event traumas entire relationships entire childhoods wartime experiences combinations of different traumas and on and on there are so many different forms of trauma if any of you are interested in trauma and its treatment I highly recommend the book trauma by Dr Paul Conte he's an MD medical doctor psychiatrist he was featured as a guest on this podcast he's been on a number of other prominent podcasts we will provide a link in our show note captions to the book trauma I consider that book to be the best book in terms of describing what trauma is and isn't and how it leads to PTSD it also describes some of Dr Paul Conti's own experiences with trauma and his own treatment of trauma in his patient population which is quite wide-ranging men women young people older people and a variety of traumatic experiences so excellent book for those of you interested in trauma now the treatment of trauma has been met with some degree of Success Through quality talk therapy let's Define quality talk therapy in the way that Dr Paul Conti did on this episode that's talk therapy for which the patient sometimes referred to as the client but more traditionally referred to as the patient and the therapist so a psychologist or psychiatrist has Good Rapport and as a consequence of that Rapport there is the feeling of support that there is a safe place in which to explore the trauma and what's happening in one's current life in order to understand how that trauma is fitting into adaptive and maladaptive behaviors and emotional states now in addition to Rapport and support being critical there's a third component of effective talk therapy for trauma which is Insight or one's ability to come to an understanding of why one feels the way they do and to link that to some larger context that brings about some degree of relief and that's where things start to get a little bit abstract and that's also where we start to see that while trauma therapy in the form of talk therapy can be very effective about half of people that undergo talk therapy and talk therapy alone for the treatment of PTSD achieve no long-lasting relief of symptoms and an even smaller number of them undergo complete remittance of their PTSD okay so their symptoms can lessen they can get some improvement but that Improvement is often slight or is transient and for those that do achieve relief it's often not complete remission of the PTSD itself now in addition to talk therapy for PTSD there is of course prescription drug therapies and most often these fall under the category of ssris selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors and it's well known that ssris can be in limited circumstances effective for the treatment of PTSD it has been shown for instance that as many as 40 maybe as many as 60 of people that take ssris for the treatment of PTSD get some symptom relief now that is not to say that ssris don't have side effects they can have side effects some of you are probably familiar with these side effects things like blunting of libido blunting of appetite or increases in appetite in some cases disruption of sleep wake rhythms motivation Etc so there's often an exploration for the so-called minimal effective dose that provides some symptom relief to PTSD but that doesn't introduce unwanted side effects and of course there's a third situation where people are taking ssris and doing talk therapy for PTSD and what's very clear is that anytime you add quality talk therapy to a drug treatment you're going to improve the outcomes for that drug treatment the reverse is not always true it's not always the case that adding prescription drug treatment to talk therapy improves outcomes for talk therapy although that has been observed in a number of studies now the whole idea of exploring the use of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD stem from the fact that even in people who are getting quality talk therapy and again we can Define quality talk therapy as Good Rapport between patient and clinician as well as feelings of support as well as potential insight and even when ssris are combined with that quality talk therapy there's still a large number of people who simply do not achieve significant or long-lasting relief from their PTSD and an even fewer number who go into full remittance of their PTSD that is despite being diligent and hardworking in their talk therapy despite the therapist being very committed despite the use of ssris in conjunction with a talk therapy those people often still qualify as having PTSD and the goal of course is for somebody to receive treatment that allows them to no longer meet the criteria for having PTSD not just in terms of a clinical evaluation but that they themselves report feeling much better not feeling overwhelmed with the symptomology of PTSD now the symptomology for PTSD is vast and it's far too vast to go into into a lot of detail right now I think most people are familiar with a stereotyped example of PTSD this is the soldier that comes back from overseas that has been in gun fights or in battles of different kinds has likely seen casualties and severe injuries and that upon return to a safe environment is still experiencing a lot of anxiety and sometimes panic attacks that occur seemingly at random or they can be sparked by you know the classic stereotyped example is you know a car backfires and then the person suddenly feels as if they're back in battle that sort of thing does happen certainly but there are a whole other category of symptoms of PTSD which include dissociative symptoms of PTSD people who have PTSD from very intensely traumatic experiences that um are checked out they don't feel like they can engage they have brain fog they are distracted they go from feeling anxious to feeling exhausted they have sleep issues not surprisingly then people with PTSD of either the dissociative type or other symptomology of PTSD and keep in mind that one can have both dissociative and non-dissociative symptoms of PTSD such as anxiety and panic are at a far greater risk of substance abuse so the current estimates are that people with PTSD no matter what type of PTSD dissociative symptoms or or otherwise you know panic attacks or both are at a much greater risk of having addictions to either illicit drugs or prescription drugs or both so things like alcohol use disorder is very common in people with PTSD opioid use disorder is very common stimulant use disorder and on and on so people with PTSD suffer at a number of different levels and there are all these what are called comorbidities with PTSD including addiction but also depression anxiety and so you can start to see how ptst sets up a whole Cascade of things that make living life extremely problematic at the level of basic relationships functioning in the workplace and even when mental health appears to be in check oftentimes people are holding a lot in so they have cardiovascular and cerebral vascular deficits that cause a lot of problems in their immediate and long-term physical health so PTSD is a very serious issue the current estimates are that as many as eight percent of people in the United States have PTSD and again the estimates around comorbidities range anywhere from you know 17 to 46 or as high as 65 percent of people with PTSD having comorbidities for other mental health issues and addiction in particular so finding lasting relief to PTSD is extremely important and made even more important by the fact that many people with PTSD sadly end up committing suicide so suicide rates are far greater in people with PTSD the exact rates of increase and suicidality in people with PTSD are a little bit hard to arrive at in the statistics because of all the comorbidities but suffice to say that suicide is far more likely in people with PTSD along with all the other issues that PTSD brings about now PTSD creates all the problems that it does largely through changes in brain circuitry as well as neural communication between the brain and body many people have perhaps heard of the book the body keeps the score which is a very successful and popular book about the idea that trauma can be quote unquote stored in the body to be clear traumas can't actually be stored in the body you don't actually store memories in the body what you store are activation of neural circuits that include brain and body and they all seem to Center back into the insula that structure that we talked about earlier this structure in our brain that has a map of our body's surface so contrary to popular belief we don't store memories in the body or trauma in the body in a way that for instance working out a knot or a pain in one's lower back will relieve the trauma it sometimes can activate a memory of the trauma but when one is doing that what you're really doing is activating neural circuits that reside within the brain within the insula that correspond to Sensations within the body now I don't want to diminish the role of the body and the formation and the Persistence of PTSD and I certainly think the book the body keeps the score is a pioneering book it's in fact an important book uh but I want to emphasize that the modern Neuroscience really points to the fact that PTSD is caused by the exact sorts of brain Network activations that we were discussing earlier things like heightened levels of activation in the amygdala to insulate pathway which of course would exacerbate bodily Sensations related to the trauma or heightened activation of the hippocampus this memory Center in the brain too amygdala to insula circuitry now therefore it should come as no surprise that if MDMA can reduce the levels of activity in the hippocampal to amygdala to insula circuitry and can do so both while someone is under the effects of MDMA but then lead to persistent long-lasting reductions in the activation of those brain networks well then it stands to reason that MDMA could be a valid therapeutic for the treatment of PTSD and of course this has been explored and here we can really give a nod and large debt of gratitude to the so-called maps group the maps group is a group that's operating mainly out of Santa Cruz California but they have a number of different satellite Laboratories and clinical groups both in the US in Canada and abroad where they've worked with government organizations to get legal authorization to give MDMA to patients who have PTSD to also give them talk therapy and then to compare the effects of talk therapy with MDMA to talk therapy with Placebo alone and there are about three to five studies in this area now that stand as large-scale clinical trials that are showing what can only be described as remarkable results for the treatment of PTSD so rather than going to any one of those studies in immense detail I'm going to summarize across those studies I will provide links to those in the show note captions the two that I think are most interesting are the study entitled MDMA assisted therapy for severe PTSD a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase three study as well as the study entitled the effects of MDMA assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 trial for the treatment of severe TSD so as the title suggests both clinical trials involve giving people talk therapy and MDMA or talk therapy and placebo talk about exactly how that was done in a moment and then to look at relief of PTSD symptoms but also relief of some of the addictive symptoms that are commonly associated with PTSD so just to give you an overview of what's happening with these trials and why there's so much excitement and why we really are on the cusp of legalization of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD in the sorts of clinical context I described when people are given just talk therapy alone or talk therapy with ssris they will often as I mentioned earlier experience reductions in their severity of PTSD symptoms and rarely they will experience complete remittance of their PTSD that is they will no longer qualify for PTSD after receiving a number of talk therapy sessions so let's compare that to what happens when people do talk therapy in conjunction with MDMA and I'll explain exactly what that means in a moment but it essentially means taking MDMA while doing talk therapy however this is a very important however the people who are taking MDMA in these trials have already done talk therapy without MDMA then they're doing talk therapy under the influence of MDMA and then they are doing sessions of talk therapy not under the influence of MDMA and the entire time they're doing that with the same two therapists okay in the placebo group people are doing talk therapy with two therapists but they're not taking MDMA okay so they're doing the same number of therapy sessions but they're not taking MDMA so to just get to the key numbers first the overall rate for clinically effective response to MDMA assisted therapy is 88 that's what's emerging from these trials versus 60 for the placebo and therapy alone so on the face of it you might say okay wow 88 of people who do talk therapy and here I might as well just finally explain how this is done patients are selected because they have PTSD they meet the clinical criteria for PTSD they do three 90-minute therapy sessions with two therapists talking about their PTSD symptoms talking about to the extent that they can the incident that or incidents the life events that led to that PTSD none of that is done under the influence of any drug okay so everyone in the experiment does that then the group divides into two where half are taking MDMA they take that three times during those three times they are also receiving therapy sessions with the same therapists that they were working with before they took MDMA the first session they're taking 80 milligrams of MDMA and then a 40 milligram booster about an hour and a half to two hours in the second session they are taking a higher dose of MDMA it's 120 milligrams and then if they elect to they can take a 60 milligram booster about an hour and a half to two hours into the session and then there's a third session where they take again 120 milligrams of MDMA and have the option to take a 60 milligram booster about an hour and a half to two hours into the session again anytime they're on MDMA they have therapists there that they're talking to about their trauma they are either spending time with their eyes closed lying down sometimes in an eye mask and thinking about the trauma thinking about their current state and experience also thinking about what happened before then they're exiting the eye mask or talking to the therapist therapist is taking notes asking questions remember they've established a strong Rapport supportive relationship with these therapists prior to taking MDMA in the therapy session and then they also undergo three 90-minute therapy sessions with the two therapists spaced one week apart after the final MDMA session now those that were placed into the placebo condition do everything exactly the same as I just described so three 90-minute sessions as prep then three eight hour sessions with those two therapists and then three 90-minute follow-up sessions one week apart but they take a placebo not MDMA so you can see that in these so-called Maps studies these clinical trials for PTSD the conditions are very similar except for the inclusion of the drug MDMA so those rates of success with talk therapy and MDMA again overall rate for clinically effective response to MDMA assisted therapy was 88 compared to 60 percent for therapy and placebo what's even more impressive however is that 67 percent of the people in the MDMA plus therapy treatment group no longer met the criteria for PTSD by the end of the treatment so in other words their PTSD went into remittance now we could say they are quote unquote cured but typically for things like PTSD that's not the language that's used rather what's used is statistical evaluation of how the different symptoms like dissociation or anxiety or Sleep Disorders are explored so while to some of you a difference between 60 percent success with talk therapy and Placebo versus 88 success with talk therapy plus MDMA might not seem like that big of a difference it is indeed quite an enormous difference in fact to my knowledge there is no other example of a treatment for a psychiatric disorder that is successful to the same magnitude I could be wrong about that I'm sure some psychiatrists out there are going to jump on me about this and please do I would encourage you if you are aware of any therapy plus drug treatment that is effective at rates of greater than 88 percent for the treatment of a major psychiatric disorder please do put that information in the comments on YouTube and perhaps a reference to a study would be even better but even if not just put a reference to that that would be great for sake of future episodes Etc but nonetheless an 88 percent success rate and here I'm referring to success rate as a significant reduction in clinical symptoms for PTSD and 67 of those people going into full remittance for PTSD by the end of the treatment is pretty spectacular which is why you're hearing so much these days about the potential transition of MDMA from a schedule one drug for which there are quote unquote No clinical applications to potentially a legal within the context of clinical use application of MDMA which it does appear the legislature is at least considering for as early as 2024 maybe even later in 2023 it remains to be seen now a number of other important results have emerged from this and other clinical trials for instance remember earlier I talked about how many people with PTSD also suffer from alcohol use disorder what's interesting is that for people that were in the MDMA plus talk Therapy Group in this and other studies who also had patterns of alcohol use disorder and even some other substance use disorders the MDMA plus talk therapy treatment in many cases resolved their addiction to alcohol or other symptoms as well and perhaps that shouldn't be surprising if we think about the addictions as stemming directly from their PTSD but it is surprising if you think about the fact that alcohol use disorder and some other addictive disorders oftentimes will stem from disruptions in neural circuitry that are the same disruptions in neural circuitry that occur in PTSD but often are the consequence of entirely other brain wiring phenomenon what I'm saying here is that just because addiction and PTSD are often co-morbid with one another it was not necessarily the case that treating and resolving PTSD would resolve the alcohol or substance abuse disorder and yet that seems to be the case often not always but often in these successful treatments of PTSD so that's very exciting some of the other particularly exciting results from these clinical trials on MDMA plus talk therapy is that the dissociative form of PTSD has traditionally proved to be especially hard to treat and that's thought to stem from the fact that successful treatment of PTSD whether or not it's by talk therapy or talk therapy combined with ssris or talk therapy combined with any drug treatment or behavioral treatment like EMDR eye movement desensitization reprogramming or other forms of treatments that are designed to rewire neural circuitry almost always involve the patient getting very close to or at least reporting the traumatic experiences in a lot of detail and you can imagine why for somebody who's dissociating from that very experience who's quote unquote checked out and can't really seem to access the emotional states and the memories because they're blocked off from them or because they're unwilling to access those memories and really think about the full emotional capacity of those memories that it would be particularly hard to bring them through any kind of treatment for PTSD so it appears that MDMA in providing this pro-social empathic again empathic for others and empathic for self chemical and kind of mental environment as well as the presence of two trusted therapists which one has a really good rapport allows patients with PTSD to really get close to those experiences that were traumatic to talk about them and to think about them and in many ways to reframe them in a context that often involves empathy for others and empathy for self now here we're not necessarily talking about forgiveness of perpetrators although that's sometimes the case that people will forgive the person that inflicted the trauma on them but more often than not it's about tying their feelings of trauma and their feelings of depression anxiety dissociation Etc to some sort of larger context that allows them to see themselves in the role of agency to be in the role of knowing that yes these things happened and yet by getting close to the emotional load of those things and really being in many ways unafraid to get close to the emotional load of that and having support around that that the emotional load seems diminished and that they experience the emotional load of those experiences as diminished both within the MDMA treatment session and afterwards for long periods of time so essentially what happens is these people feel that what once burdened them they can still remember but it no longer burdens them it no longer feels like it's in their body and in their mind or on Loop or on repeat in a way that's invasive in a way that interferes with other aspects of normal functioning so when one hears about these kinds of results and when you hear about some of the patient reports and I invite you to do that you can go to the map site which by the way is recruiting subjects for these clinical trials and you'll also find reports of individuals who participated in these clinical trials and of course we will provide links to these incredible clinical trials that Maps has spearheaded what you find is that the combination of MDMA and talk therapy in many ways is not about the drug having a particular effect it's really about the drug having a particular effect that allows the motivations and the results of talk therapy to really be heightened and I think that's a really key point to make because up until now we've really been talking about the neurochemistry of MDMA the potential toxicity or lack thereof of MDMA we've been talking about that brain networks Etc but when one thinks about the valid clinical use of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD and I should mention it also had some success in dealing with not only alcohol use disorders and other use disorders associated with PTSD but also relieving the depression associated with PTSD so now MDMA is being explored for treatment of not just PTSD but also for depression for alcohol use disorder and for eating disorders as well MDMA seems to be a compound that produces the right kind of subjective and neurochemical milieu in the brain that allows therapy to be that much more potent within a limited number of sessions and when one thinks about the cost of mental health care you know how expensive it is to get therapy over and over and over again which in ideal circumstances people are able to do that either by way of insurance or by their own finances or you know I I don't want to say that the cost of therapy should be reduced because of course therapists have to survive also but the idea here is that people who are suffering would be able to achieve relief from their PTSD their depression their addiction and to be able to do so by hopefully persisting in their therapy over whatever period of time is required but also to assume a circumstance in which somebody only has 10 or 15 or maybe even just three opportunities to undergo treatment for PTSD and nonetheless is able to achieve tremendous relief during the session and after the session and it really does seem to be the case that for reasons that you now understand the activation of particular brain networks the suppression of other brain networks in particular this amygdala to insulopathway that when people are under the influence of MDMA in these very safe and therapeutic supportive settings they are able to look at traumatic events and the ways that those traumatic events impact them in ways that really allow them to cognitively reframe those events and somatically reframe those events to really change the way that it lives in their body and mind so that it's no longer invasive and then they can go on and Lead productive adaptive lives and as a final Point related to these clinical studies I of course would be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the so-called adverse effects because anytime there's a drug or talk therapy for a mental health issue Adverse Events have to be considered and I think it's quite reassuring that in the case of MDMA therapy there were no increases in the number of suicide attempts or suicidality or obsession with suicide contrast that with the group that received Placebo where there were a certain number of Baseline and predicted obsessions with suicide fortunately at least to my knowledge there was no actual suicide attempt or successful suicide thankfully but the point being that the addition of MDMA drug therapy to PTSD talk therapy does not seem to increase the quote-unquote side effects that are sometimes associated with PTSD talk therapy because indeed there can be side effects to exploring PTSD and Trauma as one would expect so overall I would say it's very exciting times for the exploration of MDMA as an augmented talk therapy for the treatment of PTSD and these other conditions again I think the maps group has done a remarkable job of keeping this within the realm of legal and trying to move things forward in terms of legislation to make sure that MDMA isn't simply made legal and then abused recreationally I know people out there have different views on whether or not drugs like MDMA should be legal or not that's not what this episode is about what I am very excited about as you can probably tell what I think a lot of people in the psychology and Psychiatry Community are very excited about you say the Mental Health Community at large is that these compounds that for many years we're only associated with their recreational uses and therefore were not well understood because they were often contaminated or taken in combination with other things or by people that never should have been taking them in the first place taken by young kids which is a whole other matter you know a lot of issues and problems associated with these compounds and yet we're now seeing from these clinical trials when used say properly because really when safety Protocols are obeyed when there's clinical support it is very clear that when MDMA is combined with quality talk therapy that the outcomes are looking tremendously positive it's by no means a miracle cure it is by no means perfect and time will tell what problems if any arise from the short or long-term use of mdama in this context but I think it's remarkable that anywhere from two to three sessions with MDMA and talk therapy have been shown to significantly reduce PTSD symptoms and in some cases completely eliminate PTSD symptoms in such a wide range of patients and in patients that have experienced both PTSD and these other comorbid disorders I think it's really remarkable it's very exciting and I look forward to seeing what the next round of data produce so as is often the case on this podcast today we went into a lot of detail about a subject MDMA is this incredible compound synthesized as far as we know first by humans not by plants not by aliens but by humans and that produces big increases in dopamine and serotonin to create these highly motivated pro-social empathic States meaning both empathy for others and for self and that when applied in the context of psychiatric challenges like PTSD and addiction is proving to create a lot of relief for a lot of people where other forms of drug therapy or combination drug and talk therapy had failed before we talked about some of the potential neurotoxicity issues I don't think that is a resolved issue just yet although the bulk of data in humans and non-human primates point to the fact that at reasonable Doses and we talked earlier about what those are at reasonable doses when not combined with other drugs it does not appear that MDMA is exceedingly neurotoxic and it may not be neurotoxic at all of course one needs to be exceedingly cautious when thinking about the use of any sympathomimetic they of course can be neurotoxic anything with methamphetamine in it has a potential to be neurotoxic but of course dosage matters context matters we talked about that and of course the purity of drug matters and again I just want to re-emphasize the fentanyl contamination of MDMA that sold on the street and that is being used recreational is of very serious potentially lethal concern I also expect that there will be a lot of interest in these clinical trials that Maps is doing so again you can find links to that in the show note captions and I think in general we should acknowledge that we are a very interesting and important time in human history for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and for Neuroscience generally because whether or not we're talking about psilocybin or LSD or Ayahuasca or ketamine or today's topic of MDMA regardless of what drug and neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems are involved what we're really talking about are ways to access neuroplasticity the nervous system's incredible ability to modify itself in response to experience ideally to be modified in adaptive ways that make it function better so that's really the Crux of what talk therapy and drug therapies are about that's what the goal of using MDMA as a clinical tool is all about and in that sense I find MDMA to be an incredibly interesting and important topic and I hope you did as well if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please

Title: Dr. Immordino-Yang: How Emotions & Social Factors Impact Learning | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-06-05 12:00:16 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, EdD, professor of education, psychology and neuroscience at the University of Southern California and director of the Center for Affective Neuroscience, Development, Learning and Education, who has done groundbreaking research on emotions, self-awareness and social interactions and how these impact the way we learn and change across our lifespan. She explains how an understanding of emotions can be leveraged to improve learning in children and in adults, and how the education system should be altered to include new forms of exploration and to facilitate better learning and to include more diverse learning (and teaching) styles. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in how we learn, human development in children and adults, as well as those generally interested in education, psychology or neuroscience.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Mary Helen immortino yang Dr imrdino Yang is a professor of Education Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Southern California her laboratory focuses on emotions and the role of emotions in learning as well as how social interactions impact how we learn today's discussion is one that I found absolutely fascinating because it will reveal to you in fact to all of us how our temperament that is our emotionality combined with our home environment and the school environments that we were raised in shape what we know about the world and our concepts of self in thinking about that we also discuss the education system and how different aspects of rules and how we are told to behave and what actually constitutes good behavior or bad behavior shape how we learn information and develop a sense of meaning in life if any of that sounds abstract I promise you that today's discussion is incredibly practical you will learn for instance how different styles of learning are going to favor different people from children into adulthood and how we ought to think about learning in terms of our emotional systems being our guide for what we learn and the information that we retain and how we apply that information throughout life for those of you that are parents or who are thinking of becoming parents or who were once children so I believe that encompasses everybody out there today's discussion will arm you with an intellectual understanding of Psychology and Neuroscience as it relates to learning but also practical tools that you can apply in order to be able to learn more effectively what I like so much about Dr emordino Yang's research and the discussion today is that she frames up beautifully how those who best learn from traditional forms of classroom learning as well as those who learn from non-traditional forms of learning either in or out of the classroom can best use that understanding of Self in order to learn in the way that is best for them before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance of all kinds one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because your core body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees in order for you to get into and stay deeply asleep and conversely your core body temperature increases by about one to three degrees in order for you to wake up and feel refreshed with eight sleep you can control the temperature of your sleeping environment very easily because of the way that the mattress cover communicates with an app where you can dial in the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and end of your night as you arrive toward morning sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover has greatly enhanced the quality of my sleep I know that because it also includes a sleep tracker which will tell you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting and it gives you a sleep score if

huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by hvmn Ketone IQ Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones I know most people are familiar with or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet it's used for weight loss it's used to control epilepsy it's used for mental health reasons however most people including myself do not follow a ketogenic diet nonetheless increasing your blood ketones can improve the function of your brain and the function of your body and that's because ketones are preferred use of fuel for the brain and body so even though I follow an omnivore diet that is I'm not in a ketogenic State I use ketone don't IQ to increase my blood ketones prior to doing preparation for podcasts or writing grants or doing research as well as prior to workouts especially if I want to work out fasted I'll take some Ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones which gives me a lot of energy during workouts or during bouts of cognitive work even if I haven't eaten in the preceding hours it really increases my focus and my energy levels if you'd like to try Ketone IQ you can go to hvmn.com huberman to save 20 off again that's hvmn.com huberman to

Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind I've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roca understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses in sunglasses this accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity their eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for sports performance and as a consequence they are very lightweight which is great they also won't slip off your face if you get sweaty however even though they were designed for sports performance they now also include a lot of styles that are designed to be worn to work out to dinner essentially recreationally so you could wear anywhere if you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses go to Roka that's roka.com and enter the code huberman to save 20 off your order again

talking about something that to me seems a little bit high level but I think it's the perfect jumping off point I've heard you talk before about inspiration and awe and as somebody who's interested in the brain and as somebody who's interested in the role of emotions and learning and life experience inspiration and awe seem to me kind of rather high level emotional experiences compared to say fear or happiness and yet inspiration and awe just seems so fundamental to how we learn and navigate life and before we started recording we were talking about David Goggins of all people um and we'll get back to that but if you could just share with us what is the role of inspiration and awe and story in how we learn and experience life starting at a young age and then maybe we can transition to older ages yeah I mean I think what you've noticed is actually fundamental to the conundrum of being a human is that our most high level complex or in-states mind States are also fundamentally hooking themselves into the most basic biological Machinery that literally we share with alligators that keeps us alive and that is both the power and the potential of being a human and the danger of it so our beliefs are experiences our interpretations of the meaning of things which that's where the story comes in the stories that we conjure about you know collectively with other people culturally in spaces inside our own selves also those stories become kind of the through line that organizes the way in which we construct our own experience Consciousness even I would say so when we hook into those very basic Survival Systems by recruiting them into these narratives about the nature of reality the power of the meaning we make what happens is we get this amazingly both fundamental and high levels State simultaneously where we feel expansive we feel uh like it's all so incredibly beautiful and we are I would argue actually ramping into or catching into the very basic survival mechanisms that make us conscious that make us alive and and that's that's in essence the power of being a human That's The Power of our intelligence at this late stage in our evolution so when I was a kid I loved stories of all kinds like I think like most kids yeah I love my Curious George books uh I'm told I like the Babar books but then quickly didn't like the Babar books um I liked the book Where the Red Fern Grows I liked um books and stories about it generally was boys for me for whatever reason uh that had some idea in mind or some ongoing Challenge and that played out over time and the character evolves across the story yeah and of course many many many excellent stories have all those features yeah I can recall specific passages in those books to this day that made me feel something in my body you know a um I actually am very familiar with the sensation of having chills go up my spine as opposed to down my spine early on I realized oh there's sort of a difference sometimes it travels up my spine sometimes I still haven't distinguished what what that orients me to or away from but but it's a very um Salient memory and experience for me to this day so much so that as I'm describing the book Where the Red Fern Grows Right now I can kind of feel it starting yeah I've heard you say before and I love this quote and I want to make sure that you get attribution for this not me that we basically have a brain to control our body [Music] what is the the role of the brain in controlling the body and do you think that there are an infinite number of ways in which our brain does that or are we really talking about a language between brain and body of you know tingles on the back of our neck that go up tingles on the back of our neck that go down stomach feeling kind of tight and making us cringe away or kind of warm and wanting to approach in other words do you think that the conversation between the brain and body is primitive sophisticated how nuanced is it because language is very nuanced we could probably come up with 50 words just in English for the state of being happy yeah but the feeling of being happy I experience along a Continuum of a little bit happy to elated but it's it's kind of one thing really so if if you would could you comment on this notion of the brain being the organ that's responsible for controlling the body and what that dialogue is like what the syllables and consonants of it are like perhaps not at the level of biology but at the level of psychology and how we subjectively experience that sure so the first thing I'll say is that I learned that idea from it from working with Antonia dimasio so uh he was my postdoctoral mentor and he taught me first that uh this notion that that it's the feeling of the body it's it's an organism's ability to represent or map the state of the interior and exterior of the body that becomes the substrate for Consciousness and for the mind um so I would just want to give him credit because I didn't I didn't think of that first but the work that I've been doing is an elaboration of that it's it's basically addressing exactly the question that you're asking which is how is it that we construct a narrative construct a conscious feeling which that word I take from Antonio and Hannah right DiMaggio how is it that we construct a feeling and sort of prioritize that feeling elaborate that feeling into something that feels like a narrative that feels like a belief state or an emotion state or an experience I mean that in a very verb-like way and um and what is the role of embodiment in that what is the role of the brain and that um and and what also is the role of the culture and the cultural context on other people in that because what we're really learning Across The Sciences right now is just how incredibly social and interdependent our species is I mean our biology is inherently a social one we are directly dependent on other people for the formulation of our own sense of self and we interact with one another and construct and co-construct a sense of self and a sense of meaning via those cultural spaces and those sort of um nuanced ways of accommodating each other mentally and physically that that lead to the feeling of us so you know back to your original question there's a lot we don't know there um but I think what's very clear is that the kind of background sense of the body the mapping and the regulation of the body is a basic substrate a kind of of trampoline for the mind and so we are managing our survival you know we now have lots of evidence from across many kinds of science about the interdependence of our stress and social relationships and our immunity and our right and and our ability to digest food and and it's even now very clear that it's not even just us there's a whole microbiome and all kinds of other organisms that are assisting Us in that and that are collaborating with us in that um and then the brain is is this is a specialized organ of the body in fact it's not a it's not a separate thing it's it's an outgrowth or an elaboration of that process it's a specialization of that process a localization of it um in a way that provides enough processing power to be able to really construct uh all kinds of feelings and mental States and beliefs and imaginings you know um out of out of basically just the feeling of being here and then the amazing part is that our brain is also imposing those back down onto our bodies so the way in which our body reacts um and is modulated in response to mental States is also very real so we have a kind of like a dynamic uh conversation happening that's happening in very raw and and direct ways neurochemically and others and also in broader longer term slower fluctuating patterns around you know other kinds of hormonal changes and things like that so along multiple time scales simultaneously we have a kind of whole right a humanistic whole of brain and body and mind that are kind of co-conjoring one another in real time and that leads to all kinds of dynamic possibility spaces for how we are and how we feel as we grow through time and I think as humans the legacy of our intelligence is to tap into those possibility spaces and start to construct them into meaningful meaningful sort of chains of ideas chains of experiences over time that we call story and that I think is what you were tapping into as a little boy you were hungry for fodder for for a kind of structure for those feelings that you could start to help them evolve from one into the other and chain them together in ways that produce meaning yeah I'm fascinated by the idea that early in life we experience some interaction with the world it could be with other people could be with an object in the world and it makes us feel something powerful yeah and that lays a a template for of recognition meaning that later in life and perhaps throughout life we're always consciously your subconsciously going back to trying to experience that same kind of awe or inspiration um because again that the what the circumstances almost certainly vary from being a five-year-old to being an adolescent and into adulthood and into the I guess the geriatric years do they still call it that um probably I probably used a politically incorrect term but forgive me um 75 to 125. um and yet the feeling is the same right the feeling and so it's as if a word can mean the same thing but be used 50 different ways maybe 5 000 different ways to represent in this analogy I'm saying that the the word is the feeling and you know and it's used so many different ways because um occasionally I'll read a scientific manuscript that is so cool and it's the same way that I feel yes when I was nine years old and I spend all my time in the pet store looking at Tropical Fish and tropical birds and thinking oh my God that freshwater discus fish is the coolest thing I've ever seen yeah and again I think I must have a strong memory for these kinds of things yeah because I still I feel it right now in my body so it's as if the the same thing maps to so many different circumstances so is what we're learning across the lifespan a recognition of feelings in our body as ah this is something I like because of the way it makes my body feel or is it cognitive or both from your answer a moment ago it seems like it's so interconnected and bi-directional and fast that it's impossible to really say that feelings are in the body or in the brain it's really um happening simultaneously yeah it's a dynamic of merchant State let me give you an example so that I use sometimes to help myself understand the notion so I'm you know my little my little daughter okay Nora when she was two two in some months two and four months that she's a very verbal kid and uh I was sitting in the kitchen one day drinking a cup of tea I was sad about something that happened in my life but I I wasn't weeping or anything I was just sitting there I must have looked kind of you know lost in my own thoughts she's playing around on the floor she came over to me I'll never forget it this tiny little person she comes over to me and noticed I wasn't really there with her you know what I mean and she my arm was hanging down she picked up my arm and she held it against her face like that and she said I won't say in baby talk because you won't understand but she said don't worry Mama I'll take care of you and I said yeah and I said oh no that's so that's so sweet sweetie I'll take care of you too and she said and Mama I will we love you I really love you and then she said I mean I really love y'all um I really love your arm right fast forward two years later almost exactly two years she's four in a couple months and she was in bed one night laying in her bed in the dark and I walked by and I listened at the door to see if she was sleeping there and I hear this little whisper comes out and she says mama I love you more than I'm glad that there's daytime right what's changed developmentally from her at age two to her at age four right I would argue that the physiological substrate of her attachment to her mother is probably quite similar she had this sort of visceral automatic biological you might say attachment connection to me emotionally that she was trying to leverage in the service of making sense of you know being active in that world and adapting herself to the situation helping me in the first case right but what's changed remarkably is not the substrate of that attachment it's her ability to conceptualize it right when she's two her love is experienced as this incredibly concrete embodied real physical thing like I love you I mean I really love the body part I am currently smooshing against my face right whereas two years later she can conceptualize that love in terms of an idea which is you know wouldn't it be awful if there was night time all the time and there was no sunshine and daylight and I couldn't go out to play and I couldn't write you're describing my biggest fear people listening to this podcast I know that I'm gonna go into the grave hopefully a long time from now yeah telling people to get morning sunlight in their eyes yeah but please continue yeah no but that's right so she's thinking about how much she is grateful for there to be sunlight and in her little mind she connected that to the the feeling of being attached to me and used one to explain the other right so that both things now have meaning and that is the way that is the way I think that we start to elaborate these very basic physiological attachment States aversion States right motivational states of various sorts into mental States beliefs poems you know uh love songs all the things that she does right even between Age Two and age four that really are mental elaborations meaning making of that very physiologically basic sensation does that answer your question it answers it incredibly clearly uh and so much so that I'd like to continue to build on that example um because I think it's very relatable for people and it's the first time that I've ever heard the embodiment of emotions described in a developmental framework that truly makes sense okay um so thank you so the contact with your arm or your arm or both uh was the the was the life example that she was using it as a two-year-old that maps to an internal feeling and and we're gonna assume she's not here we don't have her in a brain scanner we can't ask her but we're going to assume that her experience of being put to bed at night and and feeling so so much love from and for you map to her then uh growing understanding of the the world around her the fact that there's day and night and sunshine so as her knowledge base grows she can add examples to the feeling and I'm assuming that um doesn't matter how old she is now but I'm assuming that as a 14 year old the knowledge base is going to be different and is going to map to that feeling again and again so the question is is what we are doing across the lifespan is recognizing um sort of I don't want to call them Primitives but um basic emotional states which are not infinite but can be along each one along a Continuum so a little bit of love completely in love you know along Continuum and everything in between um a little angry and annoyed to completely Furious are we talking about maybe um 10 to 30 core emotions that then we are just simply binning our experiences into and onto and mapping onto and then that's our life story and I'm not trying to oversimplify things but um that seems to me like a pretty great way for a nervous system to navigate a world that is infinitely complex yeah and has a lot of surprise both positive and negative and in which like every organism our main goal is to survive as long as possible and not for everybody but in many cases to try and make more of ourselves I mean those seem to be the basic Drive survive and make more of oneself it seems to be the two basic functions of everything ideas or more of your work from more of your art right exactly um so is that in an overly simplistic way to think about it or does it does it work even if there's more that needs to be added does that work as a 20 year old I learned things in college and I'm like this is awesome the first time I learned about the hypothalamus this whole marble size structure and the fact that different neurons sitting right next to each other can put us into a rage where we'll make us want to mate or we'll make us thirsty or hungry or tired I was like wow yeah I mean it just it blew me away it still blows me away yeah but the feeling is the same as looking at The discus fish in the in Monet's Pet Shop on California Avenue when I'm nine years old so is that the way to think about it I think yes I think there is there's an awful lot of basic physiological mechanisms that are that become motivational mechanisms right in in all the senses uh adaptive mechanisms that we share with all life forms not even just all animals but all life forms but they look different in different life forms for sure because the Adaptive functions the time scales and everything are different if you're a tree than if you're a fish then if you're a slime mold or you're me right but I think you're right that what we basically are doing is taking these very primitive physiological regulatory capacities that are essentially there to keep you alive and and that's a very Dynamic thing to keep you alive you have to constantly adjust for the the needs of the internal organism the needs of the external uh you know the the demands of the external environment on that organism and being able to manage in that space over time is a very complex Dynamic um kind of kind of iterative process and we take those process processes and we conjure out of them a form of Consciousness an awareness of those processes that becomes something that feels mentally powerful to us and and I think one of the ways that we can know that what you're saying is right is that you know this is just our first experiment on this but but I think it's really poignant we we we first started to study um the the ways people would react to social stimuli right to have emotions like Compassion or or admiration in the MRI scanner um by telling people uh stories of true people situations that invoked these emotions in all kinds of piloting and then we ask people how does it make you feel and then we can see whether they actually feel that way and then we move them into the MRI scanner and ask them again to watch the story and feel it and what we expected we had some very basic hypotheses that things like I'm watching somebody else under physical pain would activate the same systems in your brain that allow you to feel physical pain uh and the same with pleasure around admiration for skill by watching somebody do flips on their bike on a railroad tie or whatever it is right um or virtue right watching a civil rights leader or somebody who does something that's incredibly virtuously powerful but not physically skilled um and we had a real surprise in those findings which I I think really went against the prevailing notion of how emotion works and which is still something which I wrestle with trying to understand so we hypothesized that feeling emotions about very physical direct things and feeling emotions about you know I'm like drawing them in space but feeling emotions about a complex elaborated things like compassion for someone having lost a spouse or something where you don't see any real physical pain but you can imagine how they're feeling based on your shared experience of loss right or admiration for virtue um that those things would build uh neurobiologically the way that they build developmentally the way that they build evolutionarily um and we did find that to be the case and many other groups and experiments have found that too but what was a real surprise to us is that emotions based in pain and emotions based in something rewarding or pleasurable like virtue which is really inspiring as people describe it were actually recruiting the same brain systems including the hypothalamus right and other systems like the anterior insula which is basically visceral somatomotor cortex it's cortex that feels the state of how you're digesting your lunch whether your heart's pounding all these kinds of things right what we found is that these emotions when they get complex when they're about Stories the valence is no longer the defining feature the valence doesn't even matter that much instead what matters is does the emotion pertain to a story that is conjured in our minds or does it mainly pertain to what you can directly Witness by looking at the person so they step off a curb they break their ankle and you go oh that looks like it really hurt right versus they're eating dinner alone in a restaurant and somebody tells you his spouse died just a month ago right where you have to tell yourself an entire story about how he must be feeling in that situation as compared to just looking at him and seeing the ankle and going ooh you know and it was that leap which is really uniquely human which is fully developed really throughout a very protracted period right little children do not fully appreciate those kinds of mental States yet right and in adolescence kids are all about trying to conjure and simulate these things and they do it very you know they overdo it and they do it in these very sort of awkward ways that adults recognize as uh you know uh not likely to correspond fully to reality right many times um and then we start to build more and more facility more and more sort of wisdom around Conjuring the story that makes the most direct parsimonious sense out of the things that you imagine somebody else may have experienced given the complexities of the context in which they find themselves it becomes more and more Dynamic more and more sort of inferential and so this also goes back to what you were saying about development this is actually how I see Development Across the lifespan my little two-year-old loves the arm then she loves me as much as something else that she really appreciates like daylight and then she goes on from there and when she's 80 God willing someday right she'll be making a different kind of story picking out things that matter in more subtle ways that other people may not notice because of the historical context because of her her more lived experience that she brings to that story right so the things that become Salient the things you learn how to notice and build a story out of are Developmental and they're learned across time but the basic fundamental processes around the emotions are always driving the need to make the story and so just to come back answering what you said before I think we have this incredibly complex Dynamic set of basic emotions or whatever you want to call them physiological states that we share with other organisms that are basically action programs that teach you run away from this right move toward that um eat this don't eat that right but those things in humans and to a lesser degree in other in other animals become the fodder for not just action programs in the moment but ideas that transcend time ideas that become the narratives of the stuff of beliefs of values of uh of identities um those more ethereal you know Essences of us that are conjured entirely by us in cultural spaces are fundamentally grounded into our ability to experience the world in a real physical embodied sense but but allow operated far beyond that I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 I started off studying the visual system and I don't want this to turn into a discussion about the visual system but in the visual system uh we know that there's a what's called a hierarchical organization where the eye encodes and can respond to edges and light versus dark and red green blue and from that very basic set of building blocks there's an elaboration or a build up of what's really called the iceberg model that was developed by my scientific great grandparents David hebronson weasel who won the Nobel Prize for that work where you can look at somebody's face and recognize it or see a profile moving at a particular direction and still recognize that person or um see a word written and and conceptualized in your mind's eye what that word like bird actually looks like like parakeet blue parakeet in other words there's a hierarchical buildup and what you're describing sounds somewhat similar that there's a hierarchical organization whereby through development we we first learned I guess earlier I called them Primitives but basic building blocks of you know when someone steps on my foot it hurts it can hurt a lot or a little bit depending on who stepped on my foot um whether I have a shoe on so you start learning context but that there's a build up on top of the basic somatic experience of different examples that map to pain including emotional pain and physical pain because we know those are interdigitated somewhat um and that over time this builds up so that we have you know countless examples but you added you said something else that's that goes beyond the hierarchical organization that we see in the visual system which is that when there's a narrative or a story that we have to add it changes something about the representation of emotion I'm I'm so struck by this by this um comparison between seeing somebody step off a curb and break their ankle like even as I'm describing just like a folding ankle like ouch yeah that really just look at what you're doing with your face right yeah I mean I broke my I've broken my left foot five times growing up doing the same Sport and it just I can still hear and feel the thing going and that means six months in a cast or whatever it is versus a story you know seeing somebody sitting alone in a cafe writing in their journal and then you learning that they just lost their spouse of 75 years right two fundamentally different visual images right the emotion could perhaps be the same like oh yes that is rough and yet the need to impose story yes changes it do I understand that correctly that there's something not just more um developmentally mature about adding in story and adding context but that when we have to do that that there's something that's fundamentally different about how the emotions are mapped in the brain it I guess the perhaps the the answer I'm looking for is what did you see in brain scanning experiments where somebody views a simply a physical break of a somebody's limb versus somebody has to add story is there something that um that comes out in the subtraction of one from the other that tells us oh there's a whole set of brain networks that are not just about saying ouch yes but that have to do with the the need to conjure up story and what what are those brain areas and then perhaps we can we can um digest those a little bit yes and actually that is exactly what we found a whole system of brain areas that that did this which now many people have described and we're still trying to understand the full role of these Network works but you know these regions together are called in the literature of the so-called default mode Network right because they were these the the co-activation of these characteristic regions of the brain which are in the back middle of the head and some characteristic regions in the lateral parietal and you know um you know those were first described uh in neuroimaging experiments where people were asked to just rest right rest and relax don't think about anything just clear your mind for a few minutes right this is Marcus rackel and his colleagues back in 2001 um and then and then contrasting that with um uh tasks where people have to do something very you know attention focus requiring where you really have to work hard and think and they found that these highly metabolic characteristic regions of the brain were coming online and activating themselves when the person was resting and deactivating and decoupling from one another not talking back and forth and exchanging signal very much um when someone was doing a really effortful mental task and that was a real conundrum for a long time and what we now know is you know when you ask somebody to think about nothing or rest you know for a few minutes you're laying in the skin or thinking I'm thinking about nothing I'm thinking about nothing and then you start daydreaming about all manner of stories you start to imagine yourself into the future here I am winning the Olympics Tada you know or hey it's my Grandma's birthday next week I wonder if she'd like to go to lunch or if she'd rather have flowers you know you're imagining other people's mind States you're thinking it's like I'm mad at me at work you know or I wonder if I should you know change jobs you know you're thinking about all kinds of possible spaces that don't actually physically exist in the real here and now and and so what we found is that our findings were I think some of the first if not the first to to actively demonstrate an increase in activation in these default mode systems not a decoupling of them but an activation of them when we ask somebody to do an effortful mental task and what was the task asking people how do you feel about this story which involves a lot of imposing of cultural and social and contextual knowledge to be able to appreciate so the story of the guy sitting in the cafe writing in his journal uh who lost his spouse of 75 years you have to know a lot to be able to appreciate how he must be feeling how does it make you feel let me pull up a lot of relevant knowledge personal experiences and memories and then hypothesize generate some kind of narrative some kind of storyline that would accommodate his situation and allow me to infer those kinds of stories which are very different from here's somebody stepping off the curb wow look at that ankle right it's very obvious how you should how that makes the person feel and how you should feel about that you don't really need to bring a whole lot of cultural knowledge about their you know personal history with their spouse to be able to understand that's breaking your ankle hurts right and what we found is that it was those kinds of stories where people had to bring a lot of contextual knowledge to fully appreciate that activated these default mode systems the spout the losing of the smell losing of the spouse so what we later showed in a series of experiments um contrasting uh true stories that are meant to induce admiration for skill right like something physically skillful somebody can or cognitively skillful and memorize a Rubik's Cube and solve it with your eyes closed right or do flips on your bicycle and land on a railroad tie right like these incredibly skillful things um as compared to uh uh the same kind of basic emotion in the sense of feeling like inspired um like attracted to it like it's pleasurable like it's really cool like you wish you could do that too but now it's about a state of that person's mind or quality of character or disposition of self so talking about the incredibly Brave of uh actions of Malala in Pakistan standing up to the past to the to the Taliban right where it's not about how well she walks down the street holding her school book there's nothing really physically skillful to see there it's about the conditions under what she's doing it and what you can infer about her state of mind and her quality of character to be engaging in these actions under those conditions and those complex kinds of inferences we found activate these default mode systems uniquely and in fact we can in trial by trial experiments so literally depending on what you say about a story whether it inspires you that particular story out of 50 right in a two-hour interview beforehand if you are inspired by a particular story as compared to another one which may not resonate with you right um then when we put you in the MRI scanner we can predict that you will actually activate these neural systems differentially based on your psychological reaction in the interview so we can actually show that there are systematic ways in which these large-scale networks of the brain so the way in which the brain's kind of balancing its activity and its crosstalk around the different parts that are contributing different kinds of processing those Dynamic balances are are are different when someone is what we're doing what we're calling now transcending the situation of that person right and starting to learn something bigger about what it all means or what the story is or the the broader reason why this inspires me um and not just is about her right so you can look at Malala and you can say you know oh uh uh I hope she makes it that's that's that's really unfair and I and and like right or you can look at her and say and kids say this to us and experiments with teenagers um but wait a minute and they actually wait they cover their face they close their eyes they look away from the from the Malala video and they look at the plane ceiling and we can actually get coders with the volume off to identify these periods of time and say that when they come back from that pause their speech slows their their posture closes right they put their hands down that kind of thing they don't gesture right and when they come back from that they are talking about two things they're talking about the broader inferential narrative around what all this means wait I didn't know not everybody in the world doesn't get to go to you know gets to go to school you know that's not right right and and these ethical interpretations that's not right and the third thing that comes up is a feeling of self and what it means for you because you're using your own self and Consciousness as a kind of springboard like a trampoline like we said before to try to appreciate what it must be like to be her so the next thing people say to us or kids say to us especially is it makes me realize that I go to school all the time and I kind of take it for granted and maybe I should work harder to try to do something about that for other people you know so we have this incredible Confluence in the brain and mind this layering of of of of real physical actions and things that happen that you can directly observe with the visual system right in the world and then you impose upon those a desire to construct a story or meaning and you elaborate that meaning and in doing so you also ramp up the internal sense of self-aware awareness of me being me of conscious systems systems that support Consciousness in the brain and brain stem very basic things we share with alligators right that become that kind of inspired state of you know like wait it makes me want to do more for the world or it makes me inspired to know there are people like her she gives me hope for Humanity one kid told me right so we've got this incredible Dynamic layering of the feeling of the body the real physical body the observation and sensation perception of the world around us in a physical real or social real sense and then the elaboration of that into these cultural narratives that become feeling States and where valence kinds of disappears right it doesn't matter so much anymore whether it's painful or pleasurable it's more about does it mean something I'm suffering because it's helping someone else right and so it becomes something desirable even though it hurts me right otherwise none of us would go through childbirth right and so it's that meaning process that makes us really uniquely human and that is the development of these emotions over time I think incredible uh if I'm understanding correctly there's a feeling state in our body when we experience or observe somebody in in their own feeling state or experience it may be the same as theirs might be different and frankly as a neuroscientist I'm going to say we'll never know exactly that we won't know Angel and philosophical depression we won't if I see blue and you see blue is it the same experience it's probably not based on so from knowledge of color vision and the distribution of cones to explain why I'm saying that the distribution of cone photo pigments in your eye and my eye are extremely different uh to the point where we're not working with the same palette cool and I think that makes life interesting life interesting exactly but assuming that neither of us is colorblind red is similar enough to both of us that we both look at it and say that's red but one in 80 males is red green colorblind would look at it and would um see what you and I call Red and call it Orange in any event when we let's say listen to or watch and listen to Martin Luther King's classic I Have a Dream speech um or when I hear certain music that I first heard when I was 14. I was a particularly interesting for me time in my life in part because I was 14 and we'll get back to that it's 14. we're talking about adolescents right I I'll just say I'll go on record by saying that the I think that the music that we listen to in our adolescents and teen years is one of the main ways in which we come to recognize the extremes of these feeling State templates that you're describing I can one of the ways I prepare for podcasts is um is to walk and and for my solo podcast is to walk and go through some of the narrative my neighbors think I'm crazy um but that's okay I think they're crazy too um maybe they're both right okay that's right exactly and um but I I always know what music to listen to before I do a solo podcast depending on the state that I happen to be in driving into the studio versus the one I need to be in in order to deliver that particular material and I know because I it's almost like knowing what palette of colors or emotional colors I have in me at the moment and which ones are going to be required to deliver that material um because it's different depending on the on the topic matter for that episode what I'm referring to here is is this idea that um you know we we come to understand emotions through our own experience and how observing other people and listening to certain music can influence that and I I realize that some people probably have more of a buffer between their um experience of the outside world so-called like steroception seeing things outside us um and their internal landscape um some people I realize have very little narrative distancing in fact I live with someone who has very little narrative distancing when she watches a movie if the person gets punched yeah she Ducks she she flinches um if it's a happy movie she gets happy yeah if somebody in a movie is sad she really feels it and for a while I thought goodness you know this is like really seems a little extreme but I've talked to professionals about this and it's something called lack of narrative distancing transportation is another way to say it yeah being transported by story right and and I think that it has its adaptive utility I'm not being critical I think that's an incredibly interesting aspect to ourselves some of us I have a lot more narrative distancing especially with violence and I yeah I think that's because I grew up around a lot more violence than she did and so I see somebody you know get beheaded in a film and I and I unless it's something where I've really been built into the story of that person and it was a real world thing that I knew actually happened then I I just kind of go okay well it's a movie you know there's a movie it's not real even if it's a movie about something that was real that might be a little bit more of an emotional impact and of course if it's a documentary and it's real footage it's pretty rough yeah but I don't um I'm not horrified in the in the way that she's horrified I'm horrified but not to the same extent um so obviously that some of us have more of a buffer than others and you can see this in a movie or in a classroom full of kids watching a a speech like the eye of a Dream speech or hearing the Rosa Parks story or for instance or um listening to and watching a David Goggins social media post which I met David earlier because your son had a question for me about David Goggins who I happened to um have the Good Fortune of of having met and know a little bit I don't know him very well but I know um in from some in-person interactions and he is every bit as intense and every bit as serious about his um ongoing progression as he appears to be there there's there's no false so there it is 100 data fact genuine he does what he claims to do and more yeah um that we don't hear about super impressive human being so when we see something like a David Goggins post or we watch and listen to the I Have a Dream speech and we start to feel something yeah like whoa we're feeling inspired to use the basic language are we mapping to some subconscious awareness of that in ourselves um meaning are we mapping to some time when we felt inspired in another circumstance or are we really you know is this merely a kind of a return to a feeling state that we have to recognize I don't know if experiments have ever been done on this but is there any way to to determine whether or not we can truly have novel emotions past age 15. um or are we really just returning for that matter are we really just doing a sort of template matching of wow I'm feeling this again and and this makes me feel capable like I can go out and run today even though I was gonna basically not run today um or you know it's possible to have a a fantasy view about how the world could be in terms of um equality that um an opportunity and you know what like I that's subconsciously is my brain saying yeah I remember when I was six and and I didn't know the difference between some people having an opportunity and other people not having opportunity um is that what's happening or do you think that we are more sophisticated than that and we are actually really um uh responding to what we think we're responding to okay so wow there's a lot in there um a couple a couple of things to start so the the first thing I was thinking before when you were talking about the visual system which I think is relevant now um is is that as humans the more developed we get the more experience we have the more um we've adapted to the contexts in which we live you know the real physical context in this case the visual context included um but also the cultural values of that context the things we've noticed other people notice right how do you learn when you're living in the jungle that when you see eyeballs you should you know go stand next to your mommy right um so you learn what to notice you learn what what you need to attend to in the world and you're so when we are perceiving things either very basic things like a visual scene or hugely complex elaborate things like uh Martin Luther King's speech we are as much imposing onto the world our own expectations of what is there as we are perceiving what's actually there right so as we impose onto the world we bring what you might call our cultural ways of seeing and knowing our values and beliefs and we push them onto the experience of what we notice so even in very basic ways things like cultural values uh change the way in which people observe and remember scenes right so you know there's classic work by shinobu kirayama and other people showing that in Japan versus in uh in the U.S uh when you show people a scene of um you know like an underwater scene with like all the beautiful things that are underwater rocks and plants and things and the little fish swimming by and then one big fish swimming by right and you ask a Japanese person uh what's this a picture of they tend to talk about it's a scene of rocks and plants and little fish and then a big fish swims by um if you ask an American uh Western educated person what is this picture of they say oh it's a fish swimming through a scene right we we tend to notice first and you can he's shown that this is you know is very very automatic it's very low level it's perceptual not just conceptual and it actually changes what people actually notice in the scene and what they remember later and all that kind of stuff right we learn how to sort of filter input we're not little you know uh robots or little uh video cameras walking around observing the world and so when we see something as complex as a social story We impose onto that all kinds of personal experiences so you said are we ever able to experience new emotions after age 15 I think no but we are very well able to experience new feelings right which are the complex elaborations of these physiological States and the stories we tell ourselves about the meaning behind them that is developing all the time and it's developing through all kinds of quote-unquote cognitive media we do it through our science right by being inspired and interested in something by being in awe of something we do it through ART through trying to express an emotion or a feeling or a value State through the way in which we portray something to other people right as humans we are driven I mean even as cave people we were driven to say I was here here's my handprint I'm going to spit it onto a rock so forevermore anybody else comes in here is going to see that it was me who was here and I have a me right and so what we're really doing is moving through the world not in this kind of receptive passive way but we are actively imposing ourselves onto the world we're actively bringing our interpretive power and adapting what we do next relative to the way in which we accommodate right Piaget talked about this 100 years ago accommodate or assimilate those things into us that we that that may disagree with our schema that may uh that may align in accord and reinforce them so this matters a lot for the ways that humans experience the world more broadly because think about for example um a terrible topic like genocide or the Holocaust right how does something like that happen right how is it that people who have empathy who who love their family who love their neighbors can suddenly turn on each other right what's happened is they've shifted the way in which they naritize the context of those events the way in which they impose interpretation on somebody else's pain has been fundamentally shifted from that's another human suffering too that's not a human that's a a rat a pig a bug or whatever it is right and that dehumanization process allows us to shift our story set so that we bring another set of values and beliefs into the space um can I just say I'm I'm glad that you brought up that dark example yeah because my understanding from my psychology courses in University where that as much as we would all like to think that we are incapable of being the committers of genocide that there are studies that were done in the 50s but then have been repeated over many decades showing that um in certain contexts um essentially everybody and anybody would respond to an authoritarian figure and torture somebody else and I'm sure as people are listening to us this they're thinking no I would absolutely not do that but all the data points to the fact that if the conditions were set in a particular way um you and I and everybody else most certainly would a very eerie idea that goes back to I think Young's idea that we have all things inside of us and we certainly have all the neural circuitry components inside of us for um rage and contempt and um and horrible mistreatment of others as well as all the good stuff um but I I'm just glad that you brought up this example because um I think that for a lot of people it's it's inconceivable but I've never heard it framed the way that you're describing it which is that if the story becomes not about the other person's suffering but primarily about One's Own Story of suffering and that can suppress or literally inhibit the neural circuits that invoke empathy uh then it makes perfectly good neurobiological sense as to why that would at least be possible yeah and of course I don't think it's a good thing it's just like many aspects of our biology and psychology it just happens to be the way things are it is and I I think it really I think I mean I'm the ever The Optimist I'm also ever the educator right I I you know I'm a teacher I'm very also very interested in the ways that we design educational experiences for young people I think the only hope we have to protect ourselves against these possibilities is to systematically develop dispositions in ourselves proclivities within ourselves to question our own motives and to deconstruct our own assumptions about situations and to engage with other people's perspectives systematically and when we develop those dispositions the hope is that we are developing within ourselves a kind of um uh a veto system right a system for checking our own motivations against other people's experiences of those motivations and you know so much of what's leading I think so now we're going in another Direction and kind of a political Direction but so much what's leading us into these very divisive political types for example not just and you know the rise of authoritarianism not just in the U.S uh or the threat of it not just in the U.S but around many places in the world all of which by the way are Western educated um uh is that we are taught that to know something means you own something in yourself and then you take that with you and you impose it on the world forevermore I know how to do algebra two and I can do it whenever you ask me kind of thing and that's what a good student is where when people in learn to engage with their own knowledge States in in more Curious open-minded flexible ways then we dispositionally teach ourselves to to check our assumptions to rethink what we think we know and and this is key developmentally to notice when we need to do that and when we should just play ahead and it's totally fine and and so what we're doing I think right now to ourselves both in the education system and in things like social media is we're reinforcing our own biases by diving down rabbit holes where you re-hear the same thing over and over again that reinforces your own belief systems and then you come to believe those things and those put you on a train toward a particular kind of action or belief system that never becomes deconstructed and it's very comfortable and it's easy to do but the responsibility I think we have as individuals and as groups as humans given the amazing intelligence we have is to rise above that and actually look back on our own selves reflectively and deconstruct our preferences deconstruct our values and our beliefs and systematically query them specifically around how they impact or influence or or or change the situations of those around us or don't right the situations and sustainability of the world that supports us or don't and so it all comes back to the emotions that drive our thinking so we have these very basic primitive physiological states which vary across individuals the degree to which they are you know incredibly powerful easily evoked versus not you know there's a lot of range in that now all of that variation makes things interesting right um but it's our ability to learn to experience those and to know develop wisdom around when we need to query our own emotions and deconstruct the narratives that are that we're using to validate or substantiate those kinds of emotions in order to assess whether we actually are right whether we should continue or whether we should step back and and and and and and reframe right and so that kind of mental flexibility really comes out of an emotional disposition it is our ability so it takes it back to what you're asking at the very beginning it is our ability to not just drive from what feels like the bottom up which of course is always starting in the top down because you've got some interpretation of the world that makes you feel fear and that makes your body do this that makes you right um but also to be able to rise above to transcend and think about what are the broader systemic historical uh uh ethical Civic implications of this narrative I'm telling myself which feels default like the truth and how might I deconstruct those systematically and how might I invite others to give me their version of those events and engage with those systematically in order to be able to really appreciate the implications of my beliefs and so the bottom line is that the emotions that we're talking about today are actually the fundamental drivers of all of our thinking decision-making relationship building right our community lives and our personal well-being all in one mix but that doesn't kind of excuse us for acting on their bequest it actually imbues us with a responsibility to then develop dispositions to systematically query those and reframe them when they are not serving us or the world well exactly what you said so much so that you know I I'm a big believer in following lots of different types of social media accounts yeah I've taken some heat here and there yeah because people automatically assume that if you follow an account that you subscribe to that ideology but I follow many accounts to whom I disagree with what they say specifically so that I can learn different perspectives as far as I know we're the same species me and these other people yes as far as we are and sometimes I wonder but um they probably wonder the same way about me they Wonder too um and there's enormous range in in those uh those accounts that I follow um and I follow different accounts for different reasons some for entertainment some for information some for challenging myself some for um my desire to be baffled every now and again but to always return to this idea that we're all we are all basically working with the same building blocks of neurons and neurochemistry some people's dopamine which whether or not you're into Bitcoin or um traditional currency uh the one true currency that's Universal is dopamine everyone's working for dopamine and exchanging their own dopamine with World experiences but this is one of the reasons why I think it's important to not be siled in one's thinking or exposure to different things on social media a somewhat controversial statement actually because I think a lot of people assume that if you follow somebody from a particular political party then that means that you vote that political party Etc um but that to me always seemed crazy I'm fortunate to have a good friend who is on this podcast Rick Rubin who's a extremely accomplished music producer and instead produced music from essentially every genre of music punk rock which is what our story I got my start and still love punk rock music so much but classical and Hip-Hop and everything in between and Rick is somebody who forages so broadly and I've really learned to try and forage broadly in terms of ideas and ideologies and it's I think a lot of people are just scared to be exposed to something that they hate so much because they don't like that feeling in their body of of disagreement um but yeah dissonance is very uh you know that kind of cognitive dissonance we call it is very difficult it takes work to resolve it yeah I I guess is is there I like to think there's a way to step back from that and observe it not from a disconnected stance but from a place of curiosity about what's driving the those mechanisms in people and and maybe where we need to adjust our thinking maybe not to adopt their mode of thinking 100 but maybe you know 10 or 2 I think one of the the reasons things are so divisive right now is because of social media and the siloing or of kind of Orchard very um Divergent trajectories of people only following and listening to and obeying certain kinds of information and other people the other and I think the pandemic is the place where all that really clashed very heavily um and continues to Clash in other areas too um certainly not something that's going to be solved um inside of this conversation and yet I do have um a question that that grows from this aspect of our discussion which is you know what do you think can be done at a concrete level in terms of Education of younger people as well as educational people who are out of high school and and Beyond to try and adopt these more um encompassing modes of of learning and experiencing the world I mean it's one thing to say you know expose yourself to lots of different ideas um it's another to to understand how to how to do that in a way that that is um adaptive and that any ideas you have um I think what I know I and the audience would really appreciate and and feel free to to um make this an editorial um or or map back to data I mean obviously this is your wheelhouse this is this is your expertise so I'm curious what what should we do should should I send my family members who have very Divergent political beliefs from me um information um to the to the contrary they're thinking or should what do I do and what do I do for me what should we all be doing with our 10 year olds and our yeah and ourselves well I won't I won't comment on should you send your family members your there's other people that do that and they they do that work and they know how they're always frustrating each other over text message it's okay it's okay it can't get any worse yeah no okay we all love each other anyway but one thing I really do think a lot about in this is um the way in which we educate our young people and what do we do with our 10 year olds right and like the first thing I'll say about your time well I don't know if you actually have a 10 year old but is um is is query them about their beliefs when they follow something when they think something's impressive or bad or you know ask them why teach them to unpack their own beliefs that doesn't mean that you that you don't still hold them necessarily it doesn't mean that you adopt the opposite belief right if I talk to someone who has a very different value system than I do and I disagree with them that's legitimate but two it also but but in deciding that I disagree I have sort of Revisited my own belief and queried it I've I've externalized it a little bit made that thinking visible is why we talk about it in education that's David Perkins at Harvard talks about it that way you know making your thinking visible and then examining that thinking and and so I think one really important step that a society will have to take or we won't make it and I know that sounds a little um dramatic but I actually think it's true sadly uh and I'm starting to think it's more and more true is that we need to really get Brave about how we think about the process of educating our young people and what it actually means to expose young people to developmentally appropriate age-appropriate opportunities to grow themselves as thinkers as individuals and as Civic agents and community members I I think that our Western designed education system has in it some very basic beliefs about what counts as knowing and what is worth thinking about and knowing about and how do I know that how do I test you on that that I think is deeply they are deeply problematic and lead us I mean I know this is a strong statement but they lead us to a place where we are we are actively punished not just not encouraged but I would say actively discouraged from really playing with ideas engaging systematically with our own beliefs deconstructing those beliefs and engaging with complex perspectives on topics and ideas that is just not what school is about and it needs to be we need to shift so right now the way in which we think about school is about is basically judged by quote unquote learning outcomes right what have you learned and how do we know that we make you demonstrate it by yourself under time pressure in a particular setting right or you're going to come back and I'm going to give you a question and you're going to give me the answer I had in mind and if you do that in time then I'll say you learned it and now we're done check right as compared to a system and there are Educational Systems like this this is not um there are people for example the performance uh assessment Consortium in New York City is a Consortium of public schools some of which do this extraordinarily well they have a a dispensation from the New York state government uh not to give the Regents exam as their graduation requirements um and their um and and their their benchmarks of learning but instead to have alternative ways of assessing kids where kids work for months to years depending on the project on these in-depth intellectual multi-disciplinary projects where they explore a topic and they engage with their own process of learning about that topic and they bring in teachers and Community experts and other people and they present their work and then they query the work and they talk about their own learning process and what could happen next and what decisions they made and all these kinds of things exactly you have to invent not just the work but the question look at the world and notice what it is we're not understanding that we would benefit from understanding and find a way to to isolate and systematically query that why don't we build education systems from preschool all the way up that in that engage people systematically in that kind of intellectual curiosity we don't do that so we we know that little kids education preschool education if you don't have the water table in the sand table and the cool stuff and the choices and the ways to engage with each other and you know I mean all the stuff being really age appropriate for three-year-olds to touch and smoosh and you know try to taste and whatever else they're going to be a mess on the floor they're just not going to come they're going to refuse to come to school right and they're going to be laying in the in the doorway throwing temper tantrums right but as so we know how to do little kid education well it doesn't mean we always do it but we know that they need to be intrigued they need to be invited to think and they bring their Natural Curiosity and then you expand the range of ways they can leverage that Curiosity to discover new things they hadn't known to think about before right then we get to the standard quote-unquote educational system and we somehow think that that natural human proclivity to engage curiously and meaningfully with deep thinking about ideas and the world is is like inefficient and inappropriate and frightening and we teach kids no no no no no turn that off it's it's it's dangerous if you do it it's considered insubordinate right and what we want to instead to do is just let me give you what I've already figured out for you I'm going to give it to you and you are going to give it back to me so it seems to me that in the way that things actually happen in school what is created is kind of desire for the kid to be a computer not a human and they do have a dopamine system however and so what becomes the the buzz the emotional Buzz is performance yes if it becomes a buzz at all so for the kids that don't get that buzz from performance or they don't or they don't intrinsically love the math or the English or the books that they're being presented with or or whatever the subject happens to be um or maybe they only like one or two things then they emotionally dissociate from the rest of the material I'm actually describing a bit of myself in high school I I was not I barely finished high school um I dropped out of sixth grade for a few months yeah didn't work for me yeah you know I eventually got back to it and and as I imagine you did too um so we ended up as academics but um I think what you're describing is so key um and I never thought about it from the perspective of oh yeah as young kids like we're given all the things that are going to drive our sensory World um in the appropriate ways top watch and sound and um we're trying to build meaning in our mind and that we get to um as students young very Young Learners impose some of our own um intrinsic motivation to do certain things and not others and that that isn't supported as we're adults I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals a long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be assessed with a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information about what to do with all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc and then to assess what sorts of Behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes three new hormone markers that are critical to measure during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years these are estradiol progesterone and thyroid stimulating hormone if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside trackers plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off what you're describing is so vital what age do you think this um Cliffs off so you okay so in preschool kids are allowed to do this in kindergarten they're allowed to do a first grade they're allowed to do it in most schools but at what point do is the expectation imposed on kids to become little rote um um learning computer machines and to get their dopamine from um performance rather from intrinsic pleasure in what they're learning thinking about you and also how do we address this issue that there are certain basic skills that not everyone is going to perform well at and so for the kid that says I don't like math well you still have to learn it you need to appreciate it how do you so how do you conjure up in a a joy or an appreciation in that kid I mean it seems like a hard thing I mean I eventually set myself along a academic trajectory um to that worked out um but that was initially just out of pure fear because my life was was really bad I made circumstances and myself made it bad and I was rescuing myself from basically becoming more of a loser so I was like okay school's the thing and I just school and that was that was the turn hard right into into academics for me but what do you do for the person who is like really doesn't like math because they're struggling with it or doesn't like biology or psychology I mean how do we how do we evoke a at least an appreciation for that um it sounds like the emotion system is the key system to leverage in order to learn and and so could you talk about the relationship between emotion and learning yeah because I realize this is really the the center of what you do so I mean you could say it this way right so whatever you're having emotion about is what you're thinking about right and whatever you're thinking about you could hope to learn about remember something from right understand differently so the key question for educators is what everybody's always having some kind of emotions all the time if those are dead right or unconscious what are people's emotions about in this space if the emotions because whatever those emotions about that is what you're learning about so if the emotions are about the outcomes did I get it right am I going to flonk and I can make plus I'm so smart I'm so stupid well any one of those right if those are the main drivers then that is what you're learning about if the emotions are about the actual ideas in play the math the physics the why does the ball roll down the ramp wait a minute that's the same as why the moon goes around you know what I mean like there are right when the emotions are about ideas then what you're engaging with is learning about ideas and so what I would argue is that in setting up the kind of accountability system we have we have taught people that their emotion should be about these high-stakes accountability measures which means that's what we're learning how to think about perform perform not how to think about the ideas not the intrinsic power of using math to understand the world in a different way so how do you engage kids right you engage kids by setting out Rich problem spaces that but in problems that invite them to try to engage with something that piques your curiosity that's meaningful to them or have them bring in well the kid who really hates it like what is it that you do find interesting kid right start there start there and start using your your academic skills in a way that will give you power to do what it is you're interested in doing that's the way in use your writing use your math use your persuasive argument skills use your filmmaking skills whatever it is to tell the story of something that you find deeply meaningfully powerful to understand and all of a sudden you need the math kids actually say things like like there's this lovely um there's this lovely uh long quote from a from a Sudanese immigrant kid in one of these New York schools uh with the performance assessments um uh in a in an article I wrote with a colleague named Doug connect um the article is called building meaning builds teens brains you can find it in educational leadership there's a big long quote from this kid at the end and he's basically explaining what math class meant to him which he had never passed a math class before and he says he got this problem called walking to the door which is basically Zeno's Paradox right you get halfway to the door halfway to the door halfway there do you ever get to the door why or why not right and they spent months learning the math that would help them get at that problem and he talks about how I had a problem he says and I had to learn fractions I had to in order to be able to solve the problem I had and as I engaged with fractions and that problem I got fascinated he says by finite and infinite and these ideas were driving my need to learn to do fractions right so we've got the cart before the horse I'm not saying you don't have to learn math or you don't have to learn to read or write or or do all these other kinds of skills but we make those which is in the horse's cart you know what's in the cart we call that the the metric of the education system and the aim of it when in fact it's the quality of the horse can that horse pull the thing right that's the development of the person and what they put in their cart then serves that development it's the toolkit of ways of knowing and understanding that come with you as you move into the world but this this takes real real developmental skill on the part of Educators right who are not supported or or or resourced or trained to think about development in these ways I mean so you asked when does this fall off it really depends on what school system you are and what demographic you are when it falls off but for almost everybody except for the privileged few uh who are in very Progressive alternative schools it falls off by adolescence which is when school gets serious and it's also ironically when developmentally kids are developing the neural capacity and the psychosocial capacity and the drive to infer complex narrative meaning from the things they are doing you know these aren't just my shoes these are a statement about you know what I believe about sustainability and about sports and about adults and Counter Culture right and as we grow into a space where we're driven to try to you know Challenge and think about big meanings and engage with perspectives and emotions and social issues and Broad important existential questions be they in physics or be they in art or be they in the social Civic domain right what do we do we double down on controlling the input and the output transactional mechanisms that count as quote-unquote academic rigor and achievement right we start to ask kids you know what's the name of the the servant who shows up in the scene and and Great Expectations right is it Molly or is it Maria right and it's you know like who the heck knows and that is not the point of reading Great Expectations right we take away because we're afraid as Educators as Society we've got this narrative around young peoples and particular but everyone's propensity to build and construct meaning in these spaces and self in these spaces that agency frightens us because we're worried they're going to take risks they're going to do something stupid they're going to they're going to fall off the track they're gonna not make it in the traditional system and in trying to protect them and shield them from their own Curiosities their own dispositions for meaning making we I would argue actually stunt their ability to grow themselves to the point where we have mental health crises literally crises in in mental health right now in adolescence across demographic groups especially bad in young girls as I understand yes that's right but but after that in everybody and it's worse than girls yes we don't fully understand why that is um uh got some you know suggestions uh you know what we're really doing is actually producing people who are gutted of their own inner drive to become someone who thinks powerfully in the space of the world we are frightened to let our young people have that power which is the role of adults is to wrap around young people and help them learn to to be reflective to be systematic to be rigorous with themselves as they develop the capacities and dispositions to deconstruct their own beliefs to deconstruct their own aims and goals and the ways they understand the world and to rebuild them iteratively over and over in this in this sort of intellectually humble curious way where we're constantly querying ourselves constantly querying other people where we're willing to sit with uncertainty in complex problem spaces and think through the possibilities rather than settle quickly onto one solution what does school expect you to do settle immediately onto one solution which by the way is the solution I already had in mind when I gave you the question right right as compared to sitting with young people and allowing them this in safe and appropriate ways the space in which to actually grapple with complex powerful questions when kids develop the proclivities to do that they learn how to manage those very human capacities that we've been talking about the whole time that can lead to you know terrible evil as well as amazing virtuousness they learn to appreciate and manage those capacities within their own selves I think so much of what we see in terms of these you know quote unquote Failure to Launch examples are are because I know some of these the children of friends um really really smart kids that didn't map well to the system and therefore are not doing well really struggling and um clearly have the intellectual power it just wasn't served up to them and uh School wasn't served up to them in a way that worked yeah that says as much about the system as it does about the kid right yeah I I teach a course at um Stanford to the medical students that every first year medical student takes about Neuroscience it's team taught it's a phenomenal course um because of the the range of expertise uh in the teaching um that comes through and one thing I've noticed um is that the they're all phenomenal teachers um but the best instructors um do two things simultaneously when they teach first of all they come to the table with Incredible expertise obviously we understand what you're trying to get at if you want people to engage with ideas yeah they are true luminaries in their respective Fields addiction pain memory uh every system of the of the the body and brain that relates to the nervous system is taught in this course but that I've noticed every once in a while that um there's a subset of them that as they teach from that position of expertise not only are they clear not only are they engaging not only are there slides um sparse enough to understand but Rich enough to include all the relevant detail but they also flip back and forth in from the position of expert to the position of novice learning it for the first time that's almost that intellectual curiosity that they're keeping a lot they have this disposition we're talking about cultivating sorry to cut you off no please do um as academics we're familiar with that right interrupt interrupting in the landscape of academics interrupting me is is a sign of Interest I think Carol I think Carol dweck was the one who told me that she okay she's right and she's right yeah she's right um the great Carol dweck yeah and so um but I've seen this especially so you know there are some topics that um you know I like to think that I'm I might do this reflexively for because like for instance I started off in neural development and I adore the topic so I can't teach neural development without being completely blown away in the positive sense of how a brain develops yeah I've still never talked about this I've done a podcast on it um because it tends to require visuals um and we don't use those in the because the podcast guys most people listen to the podcast but maybe I'll do something just for YouTube at some point but that I think it's this the same experience occurs when I see somebody um like uh Dr Sean Mackey who runs our our pain clinic at Stanford teach about pain and the systems of the body that relate to pain and emotion and how to cure certain forms of pain Etc treat pain it's like he's he's clearly the world expert but the way he describes a system you can tell he's he's learning it again for the first time in parallels all of that and I feel like that ignites the emotional systems of the learner's brain in such a powerful way um that is distinct from just hearing an expert talk about something he's not relaying he's not a squirrel with nuts and giving all the nuts to the kids he's inventing the knowledge in front of them right that's a great way to put it um as usual um others are more succinct in collecting my ideas than and expressing them than I am um so I think that's a that's a powerful thing I went to a high school that's uh has a kind of a split reputation it's known as being one of the best public high schools in the country it's also the high school that at least for a while had one of the highest suicide rates in the country it's written up in various uh newspapers and and so on um and so much so that nowadays they forbid the kids there from meeting uh more than an hour before school to practice for the standardized test by the way when I was at school the only thing that school represented for me in high school was something that came between breakfast and skateboarding and a lot and frankly I wasn't in school a lot and I don't recommend that kids go to school stay in school I I missed a lot of school I had a lot of them did all kinds of weird things there's a lot of making up to do in college um as a consequence so stay in school get the basics um but this is actually where I'd like to go you have a very interesting trajectory yeah you're our University Professor you um study emotion and learning and many other things across cultures and um adolescence and and so many other important topics but um you are not a story of of like growing up in an academic family you grew up on a farm um sort of gentleman's Farm my dad was a surgeon but we had animals in a farm and tried my parents tried to have us you know growing the things we ate you've had a number of different experiences that we were talking about before we started recording but but one of the things that you mentioned was getting involved in education um where you were exposed to students of who had very different backgrounds than you um maybe you could just talk a little bit about um sort of the nodes of your experience so you grew up on this farm and then maybe just hit some of the other nodes and and then let's let's take a foray into when you first got exposed to educating others yeah um and because I think that's an important backdrop for what uh what we've been talking about here and service is a jumping off point for where I'd like to go next I'll just jump in I mean it's always hard to talk about yourself I don't know what's interesting and what's not you know to me it's just me I I think what's interesting is knowing you know where you where you've been and the things that that marked that mapped back to your emotional uh uh networks in a way that for you feel like like that mattered in terms of what you're doing now as a little kid I remember even as a little kid not liking school I was a very good kid I was a very well-behaved kid I went to a decent public school um but just the whole idea of it I just always felt like I had two left feet it never felt like it was really me there I was always trying to escape a little bit you know what I mean and thinking about when I first started educating others and like my first memory of educating others like specifically that comes to mind is I was six and I went on a little vacation in the summer to stay with my cousins in Petoskey Michigan which is a place on Lake Michigan where there are these um Stones where there's my understanding from when I was six is that there are these like 200 million year old fossilized worms in these stones and you can see them when you look at there's like little worms and you can see them yeah so I just was fascinated by these stones that these are actual fossilized 200 million year old worms and I don't know if that number is correct that's what I remember from age six so some paleontologists out there can correct me but I looked at these stones and I went to the little local exhibit they had at the library or whatever and I learned about these stones and I brought some back and somehow somebody thought to ask me to teach my second grade class when I started school about these stones and I just remember I don't know how I got asked to do this but I remember standing in front of my class and talking about these stones and just looking around the room and suddenly noticing you know that feeling when you're lecturing and you think oh my God they're fascinated by what I'm saying like every kid is looking at me and like holy crap you know like and I was so I'm like all right I'll keep going I'll tell you some more about these stones and I passed them around whatever and it must have been okay because I was then asked to give that talk all the way up to the fifth graders who were way older than me and you're a professor I was already fascinated by the natural world and able to like make meaning out of something in a way that inspired other people if I can be so blunt doesn't say that and yet I was constantly in trouble at school for not having my homework like I was just I you know the feeling of release on the Friday afternoon and the feeling of dread on Sunday evening is hard to like describe you know and I went to a reasonably well-resourced school you know um anyway fast forward up to when I was older I mean I I was just always fascinated by and I think someone this comes from my mom too um trying to you know speak different languages engage with people who are different than myself just have conversations so from the time I was old enough to barely qualify to do these programs my parents had the the resources luckily to be able to let me to do these things but I you know I went off to France and stayed on a farm there for a summer and went to uh you know Ireland I went to Russia by the time I was 18 I was working with these little kids off the street in in camping with them in southern Siberia and all these kinds of things when I was as cold as they say inside it was gloomy and rainy and muddy and cold yes uh yeah Siberia always sounds so Bleak my parents threatened many times to send me there oh no yeah no that's a real threat I mean it's beautiful in many ways but um yeah that was sad it was a sad sad story um anyway um you know I think what I I was trying to do was actually learn by doing by being by engaging with other people who knew things I didn't learning how to you know build things I was always really interested in wordworking and boat building I went to Kenya and spent eight months there as an undergraduate right documenting this traditional bowel Construction in a northern coast of Canada which are sailboats um sailboat construction where they have no electricity and everything Cabinetry yeah Cabinetry you know what I mean you can actually build Furniture so when people say they built furniture but they basically assembled a Kia Furniture cabinets and and built-in bookshelves and Furniture whatever some of my friends have pieces I made for them I didn't mean anything for myself so I don't have anything um but um yeah I mean I think I was really torn between trying to build things and Learn by engaging with other people and in these different cultural spaces you know being a woman in a cabinet in a cabinet shop in Connecticut is is really not a cultural space that I had grown up in and then go you know what I mean and yet Right Moving myself and changing myself to adapt to these different situations somehow felt like learning to me I think um and I ended up in a strange situation where I cut my hand uh opening a window at a job site and I needed to I was on workers comp and I had to take um some time to let it heal and I couldn't run Machinery so I had to figure out what to do with myself I was 23 years old and I was not going to go back to my parents for more money right so I thought I have to support myself so I um I thought okay I I went to college at a you know a high level Ivy League school and I I I majored in French because I I could that's basically why I was like I don't know I better finish I better not flunk I can do French I know I know I speak French fluently I'll do a French literature manager and done with it quickly then I'm like what am I going to do with myself I never thought I could be a scientist but I loved science so I just went around taking like a year of every science I took a year of astronomy and a year of biology and a year of physics and a year of um you know human anthropology paleoanthropology like all these things psychology and realized holy crap like this is super interesting you can study how babies think and and the natural world and then also uh be be bringing sort of a scientific lens to bear that helps you understand things in a new way so so here I was as a 23 year old with a cut hand and I thought what am I going to do with myself I convinced the Massachusetts Board of Education that I you know uh had the background knowledge to be able to uh to to teach some you know sections of AP biology and physics that they had in their high school so when I got to um uh you know I finally got an interview with this you know Public School District in South Boston where they were desperate for a teacher like I'm noticing in the Boston Globe or two weeks into the school year and you still don't have a teacher you know what I mean why don't you take me and uh you know managed to convince the Massachusetts Board of Education uh to give me provisional teacher certification based on the coursework I'd done and how well I did in that coursework because I did you know I was really super motivated I did extremely well and all that um and when I got there uh they basically said when I showed up for the interview you know um another the high school teacher wants to take those AP classes can you just teach full-time seventh grade so I was like okay so I uh I I you know had my full contingent of 130 kids right seventh graders coming through my classroom and uh the middle school had just been shut down because there wasn't sufficient funding in the town for it so they had taken the middle school kids and pushed them into the high school space uh what that basically meant is I suddenly found myself in a fully equipped high school classroom with microscopes and all kinds of scientific equipment that would be used to teach later courses with my seventh graders and it also happened that the Massachusetts Board of Education had changed the um the uh the requirements for for the way they organized science instruction and curriculum from you know seventh grade life science 8th grade physical science whatever it was you know different Sciences each year they wanted an integrated interdisciplinary science all the way across and of course that was very difficult for the traditional science teachers to do because they've been teaching only biology or only earth science or only physical science um for their whole career and they didn't know how to teach the other subjects and here comes me with like one intensive year of study in each of these domain means I was perfectly situated to like try to pull it together so some of the high school teachers helped me thank you to them um and I built out a new curriculum for seventh grade for that District around this interdisciplinary approach to science um together with other teachers it was very Hands-On very and it was very much like a web of Concepts you know we'd study nuclear fission and atoms and reactions and then the Sun and astronomy and the solar system and then and then how the the energy is being you know shined over onto the onto the planets and then the Earth and then these organisms called plants are actually using those photons to do something chemical let's talk about photosynthesis and where right and then we can talk about chemical reactions and breaking down sugars and molecules right so we built this whole web-like curriculum that I was trying to help the kids appreciate the sort of dynamic complexity of the natural world and some of my professors from Cornell also sent me uh materials and all kinds of cool stuff from the Cornell Museum that that they didn't really need and then I gave it back when I was done right with all these instructions what all this stuff is on hominid Evolution and Ashley and hand axes and all kinds of stuff so I built out a curriculum around all this stuff and I realized for the first time that I was in this amazingly fascinating space because it just so happened that the school I was working in was one of the most diverse culturally in the nation at that time I think we had something like 81 languages spoken out of 1100 kids wow that's a lot of first languages and kids were arriving from all over the world this was right after the Rwandan Genocide so kids were coming in from East Africa there were refugees from uh Kosovo and Eastern Europe there were kids coming in from Jamaica there were kids coming and from Haiti there were kids from Malaysia and uh Myanmar like there were uh there were kids Landing in that class like deer and headlights from very very uh broad ranges of cultural backgrounds and they're Landing in my science class and what I quickly realized is they were using these scientific ways of exploring the world and thinking about questions and and trying to make sense of what they had witnessed to try to understand their own sort of selves their own origin story their own place in the world why different people in this class looked and eat differently than me dressed differently than me like how is it that you look like that and I look like this and there was all this a crazy you know adolescent uh turmoil layered into this space where kids were grabbing on to the scientific ways of knowing as a handle to try to make sense of who they are and those kids started asking questions of me I'll never forget this one girl a black girl raised her hand and all the other kids are looking at her like yeah yeah ask it ask it right um and like you know she was being brave like she talked about it before school like I can't say that no I can't I say it say it and she said Miss immortino why is it that when we're studying hominid Evolution and you show us these in this Nova episode with early hominids in Africa why do they always show those creatures looking like they have dark skin why do they always look like black people and I was like well because they're on the equator and you need that level of melanin in your skin to be able to adapt and live without getting skin cancer in that space right and it opened up this amazing class discussion that actually went on for months like it evolved into a whole curriculum that was biology it was culture it was sociality where we started to really unpack the ways that we as humans are natural beings in the world and the ways in which our cultural experiences our extensions of our natural ways of adapting and that had me hooked I realized then that I could bring science right the science of adolescent development and of learning and of emotion and of culture to this very pressing real world problem of how do we help our kids actually figure out who they are invent themselves in this incredi crazy Multicultural space and become Scholars and intellectuals who engage systematic with the ideas along the way and so I I took those ideas and I started going to night school at Harvard Extension school to study cognitive neuroscience and to study uh language and cognition and you know all these kinds of topics and and quickly realized like I really needed this developmental perspective infused right I wanted to understand not just how these things works but how they got that way and so I took that back to grad school at Harvard and began to study um uh you know social and cultural and emotional and cognitive development in kids and and quickly they are also kind of hit a wall where I was I went back to the school district in which I worked and I went back to the teachers who were my colleagues and I I worked with them and I observed their classes and I interviewed their students and we did all kinds of work around how kids were building scientific Concepts in ways that reflected their cultural Concepts and ways of approaching the world and I I quickly realized you know it seems to me that kids are doing all this meaning making and we as adults are doing all this uh all this supportive you know meaning making we're also engaging and growing and learning in ways that reflect not just you know knowledge bits like little computers but also that reflect the biological substrate on which the learning and the thinking are happening and I wanted very much to understand how we could use and leverage developmental biology as a kind of a constraint to from which to appreciate the kinds of theoretical frames we were inventing in the in the real world sort of anthropological educational space the developmental psychological space how could these two systems you know act as a Venn diagram and how could the inner section between them the places where the theorizing about the natural behaviors and the way kids were making meaning and learning and describing their knowledge and engaging with each other on the one hand and the ways in which the brain and the biology are engaging in or supporting those processes on the other hand the places where those two circles would overlap it seemed to me that was where we could most uh directly Target to start to deeply understand the nature of our developmental psychobiological growth themselves and so I set out to try to study about um the ways in which culture and sociality shape the brain uh and Physiology and and survival mechanisms and development and at that time which wasn't even that long ago you know it's like two decades ago quickly realized um very very little was known you know about the way in which emotions Beyond things like fear you know flash a snake in your face and your amygdala lights up right like I was thinking of something a little more nuanced you know what I mean like what I'm seeing happening in science class among a kid from Kosovo and a kid from Rwanda as they're trying to figure out why they understand how they look different right those deeply emotional conversations they're having but they're not so cut and dry as the things we had been studying and so that's what really drove me to try to start to understand in an integrated way the way in which our our biological development and our psychological development are actually sort of two sides of who we are and of how we're organizing ourselves to build capacity mental capacity as well as sort of physical health and capacity over over the course of Our Lives as we're engaging with living incredible um story and foray into what sounds to me like really um your ability to identify how the universals Among Us like the universal biological features the universal psychological features can really strongly inform specifically what's happening now in a classroom interaction in the mind of an of a of you or somebody else or of any of us but to approach it from the other direction in other words to take what's happening now and say why is What's Happening Now happening yeah as opposed to just saying what is actually happening underneath the surface right of the behavior right as opposed to saying okay this is uh this is the psychology of character structure this is the biology of the hypothalamus but rather say you know is anyone else really um shocked about the school shooting in Nashville and go through the the feeling of shock and and go from there to the biology as a route of learning again and of course I don't want to take away anything from the the real world um seriousness of that yeah but but it sounds to me like you you saw that there's there's a different portal through which to teach and understand experience and that we are all but especially Young people are really tied to our emotional states as the as the main filters which we like that just like that and therefore make decisions and move through life I mean I think it's so key that early on I mean if we like a teacher oftentimes we like the subject if we um happen to fall in love with you know figure 4B in a paper great but that's not as that's not how I went through graduate school I just was blown away by the fact that sperm meets egg you get a bunch of cell duplications and then and then you get a brain and then you get a brain how does that happen I was just like that's crazy amazing and I was blessed with a graduate advisor who literally told me this is how it works in my lab is what she said uh she said um we have everything you need here I'll help you if you need help but basically you're gonna mess around with stuff you're not going to burn down the lab you're not going to kill yourself with any of the poisonous stuff um but then you're gonna like mess some stuff up and and do some stuff and you're gonna figure some stuff out this is literally the description and and I liked her lab because I had green countertops and she had pictures of interesting animals on the wall and then she said and I'm gonna have two kids while you're in graduate school so I'm not gonna be around very much you're gonna have to figure it out on your own and I said well can I play the music I want she said sure and I said can I put tin foil on the Windows because I don't want to be bothered and she said sure and I was like okay this is the place for me in other words she gave me a a room to explore and of course she gave me a lot of guidance along the way she was an amazing amazing garage advisor extremely blessed but it sounds to me like that that identifying what's the what's really going on now is key and that the other thing that's key is in openness to ideas I mean earlier you talked about um kind of the let's just let's just admit where we're at right now we're gonna we're in a culture War right now we're in a weird space right now it's very divisive um and one of the major problems is that we can't really talk about things I mean I think um fear of getting canceled fear of um exploring ideas is real it's very real not just for academics it's just real people are so it's important to be sensitive to the experiences of others absolutely but if we can't actually explore ideas and feel like we can walk out of the room safely then we can't really explore ideas and so um I think right now it's not just social media I think it's the fear of offending anybody um and and probably the fear of of voicing how upset certain people are about their experiences or the experiences of others whatever it is I I don't see a landscape right now where there is true open exploration of ideas anywhere yeah anywhere at least in this country so um what do we do if there if the two if at least two of the requirements are um you know an emotional gripping of of something around the learning um plus an openness to thinking about things that maybe we don't feel right to us as a way to learn how to think something I think we both agree if I may that is really critical um and that the world will be a far better place if people could do that um and how do we navigate this landscape I mean is what has to come first a demonstration of the value of openness of ideas and here I I'll just State my stance I I feel like any idea should be open to at least discussion any idea but then it needs to be systematically dissected with some rigor so that people can't just assume any idea is true yeah because just because it's true for them um and this I actually learned from my graduate advisor you know she used to say you know tolerance has to go both ways like when it comes to thinking about ideas and criticizing it can't just be I'm right there wrong or I don't tolerate that it has to be tolerance for all ideas and then you arrive at hopefully eventually core truths or at least core trajectories I mean what do you think um could support this how early should this start I mean should kids in elementary school be discussing um the current landscape of politics and what they see from a place of like we talk about safe spaces but is a safe space one in which no one gets offended wears a safe space one in which any idea can be discussed I think that's never really been defined for me yeah oh that's a really fraught issue I mean first let me go back to something you said which I would have said it differently so you said our emotions are uh a filter right and they do act like a filter but I actually don't think emotions are really filter like so much as they are the drives that are undergirding the impetus to think right they're pushing us to think about particular things and I think I mean as a scientist my disposition is always that to understand something is good and the more complexly the more thoroughly you can interrogate and understand something the better so there's nothing I'm afraid of knowing right and what you're really talking about there is the fear of knowing we why are people so afraid to engage with each other basically because it's deeply threatening to reveal things about your own experience that are not going to land in a in us in a space where we can kind of collectively engage with them as legitimate experience that's the I sort of the opposite of canceling people right it's the opposite of dismissing people it's actually developing spaces of trust where we can engage with ideas and and and take them from ourselves right so that we're they don't they're no longer personal value judgments they become cultural memes or or or or or or models or schemas that we can we can dissect together that we can engage with together and construct understanding around right and and I don't really understand my own position unless I also understand your opposition to my position even if I still disagree with you I think there are really important conversations going on right now I'll take it back to the education system because that's that's what I know it most about there are really important conversations going around on right now around reframing the experience and outcomes and aims of schooling around Civic discourse and reasoning so there's just a major report that was produced by the National Academy of education and uh another academies collaborating with it for example around this topic and helping us to move as a society toward a space where we learn to um kind of lay ideas out and develop skills for reasoning around those ideas including bringing ethical experiential emotional cultural values to Bear but then being willing to deconstruct and engage with those ideas whether they're the ones that are commensurate and fluid with our experience or that appear to be um conflicting or disfluent with our experience we need to develop a a spaces for young people especially but for everyone in in to engage with the deconstruction of our own assumptions like I said before and to engage with the with the deconstruction of others assumptions and to try to reconcile the building blocks and that's where we can build some common ground but we can also disagree we but we don't really understand our own position unless we appreciate someone else's disagreement with our position unless we can actually articulate and appreciate appreciate how it is that person's opinion is opposed to mine I don't really understand mine it's such a key point one of the reasons why I do read all the comments uh on podcasts on YouTube it takes me some time but I do it or on social media is that um oftentimes I'll get a comment or a criticism that makes it very clear that I wasn't clear about something other times I'll get a commentary criticism that makes it clear that my and the other person fundamentally disagree about something both of which are great and for a scientist is a delight so keep it coming um and of course when people agree and um they agree and make it clear that they agree from a stance of understanding that of course is also gratifying um so it's exactly what you're saying and it's one of one of the upsides I think of social media which is that unless people block their comment section and I do occasionally block people if they're being offensive to other people yeah yeah alienating people that's not inviting people into a conversation that's not constructive I actually have a rule um which is I call it classroom rules I've never announced it but I I allow for classroom rules you can swear but you can't swear at people yeah that's what I was taught in graduate school it's where weekends we're at people it's also also our rule at home although we try not to swear it so you can swear but swearing at people is not not okay yeah um and that you know a certain decorum of you know is required in order to have open discourse um so that works for me I think that um it's been a while since I've been in school but I work at a school and I think that the the ability to um not just reinforce but challenge one's own stances which sometimes leads to reinforcing our own stances it may if there will man that's legitimate I mean I have to assume that in high schools they still do debates and things of that sort I mean uh do they allow that I mean Could you um throw kids in a class and say let's debate um something really controversial and then but you have to debate it from the other side I mean just as a experiment of forcing the brain to um try to be effective uh for sake of winning but from the other perspective um uh or stance it seems like a great exercise if I if I were a high school teacher that's the first thing I do we pick the most controversial topic and then I picked I'd ask people to divide along that topic and then I'd swap them into the other one and have them argue from the other one stance yeah learning to appreciate perspectives is very is very and we'd use 14 ounce clothes no I'm kidding it wouldn't be physical it would be purely intellectual yeah yeah I mean let's take can we take it back to the brain for a moment to the conversation that we were having earlier right so we were talking about that in our experiments and now in whole you know whole bodies of neuroscientific knowledge we know that there is this very interesting neurobiological sort of processing difference between emotions and the thoughts that are part of those emotions that are you know the result of those emotions that are also incipitating those emotions right like that whole process when it pertains to uh the direct actions observable characteristics behaviors you know uh of another person or situation that you can actually directly pretty much directly and learn or infer as compared to when you have to bring a whole lot of conceptual content knowledge to Bear experiential knowledge uh simulation capacity to Bear to be able to fully appreciate the nature of a situation and we talked about how that second kind of processing that I called Transcendent is is in essence about um distancing yourself from the immediate physical you know situation the observable perceivable situation in a direct sense and instead constructing a narrative in your mind that's built from that but that then brings to Bear all these other kinds of of um information that allow you to elaborate this into a narrative that takes on emotional meaning and and psychological power as a narrative it becomes part of identity beliefs all that kind of stuff and we talked about that kind of thinking being associated with the so-called default mode which is deactivated systematically and decoupled from itself right the different regions aren't talking to each other to each other when you are in the world acting doing a task paying attention inferring the direct things that you need to notice around you you know you're in the middle of playing a soccer game the ball's coming at your head that's not a time to stop and Muse about you know Title IX and girls access to sports right you're gonna you're gonna trip and fall or you're gonna miss your shot at the goal or are you going to hit get hit with the ball right so we need to sort of manage that space in order to have these conversations and I I think what's important here is to remember that the default mode Network that is the substrate that's that is playing out your own sense of self and inner Consciousness and self-awareness and is also the basis on which we construct these broader inferential narratives that are the elaborative stuff of stories and beliefs are fundamentally incompatible the activation of those systems is fundamentally incompatible with uh needing to be vigilant into the immediate physical or social situation around you so if you feel physically emotionally culturally socially unsafe and you feel that you're you need to watch your back either literally or metaphorically as you're thinking about things neurobiologically that situation is in conducive it is not conducive to being able to actually conjure an alternative perspective in which you construct a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications with alternate prospective possible future outcomes with alternate views of the historical precedent or context being able to sort of mentally time travel into the space of those ideas is only really possible when people feel safe to think together so is it it sounds like it's anti-creative yes creativity is also associated with the activations of these networks yeah causally so in some recent work I had the Good Fortune of having dinner last year with um somebody I won't reveal who it is but he he runs a major so uh social media platform and he told me that in Japan it's common for people to have two or three or even as many as seven different social media handles yeah um and that they do this in order to embody different versions of themselves safely yeah so these are not troll accounts these are not the accounts and by the way I see you troll accounts that say whatever and then you go to their accounts as some private account where they hide rather these are individuals who have multiple accounts um in one account they might be a bit aggressive maybe even a bully online dare I say in another account they might be very fawning and um show up as the person that everyone knows them to be in the real world in another account they might be a university professor and another they're an athlete and it's fabricated in the sense that the the posts that they put up often don't accurately represent who they are in the real world yeah but it's accurate in the sense that it represents the different dimensions of their Persona that are driving their real world decision making at some level it's kind of like pretend play for little kids it's pretend play but it's it's not pretend because it's in cyberspace um I'll just go back to Rick Rubin who um in addition to being this incredible music producers is a enormous fan of professional wrestling for many years and I've asked him you know from a perplexians like why professional wrestling is it the athleticism he says it's the only thing that's real because everyone agrees it's not real and so these are characters right so you're you're agreeing for it to not be real and yet it allows these characters to fully embody these different personas and and I had the experience um years ago I was at Cold Spring Harbor laboratory summer camp for scientists where I attended and taught and I was in a cab driving out to Cold Spring Harbor from the train station so I lost it and I got into a discussion with the cab driver and he said Okay you're from California he said a New York accent I won't try and imitate you said you're from California and he said you know your governor who at the time was Schwarzenegger he said he's great and I and I said tell me more I I happened to like Schwarzenegger for a number of reasons he actually signed my PhD because he was [Music] yes and and he said well because if terrorists show up in California he's gonna go out there with a machine gun and take them down so in his adult life the Terminator he's the Terminator he's the Terminator and I realized in that moment this was a was a smart guy this cab driver a smart guy that that it wasn't a lack of narrative distancing no he had conflated the actor with the roles he played yeah and I realized in that moment that this was not a reflection of him being unintelligent it was a reflection of the fact that the brain often collapses identities absolutely of others and makes these I think it's just an official sufficient it's an efficient way to to parse the world yeah we decide and then that's that kind of this person and we put them over there on a shelf right yeah so so to return to the discussion that that we're having I I think that the ability to embody different aspects of self but also the ability to transiently embody the personas of other people and to do that in a way that allows for really thorough exploration of idea space yeah I feel like can only be a good thing yeah provided it doesn't get physically violent or something um but that to me seems like the exact opposite of what's happening now which is that um people are siloing off into their camps where specific language and specific ideas are accepted and others are not I mean it's it's it's so interesting and perplexing and disturbing to me that the way that certain things that have nothing to do with politics get lumped with one group or the other you know that um it's so crazy to me on the one hand and um and yet I I think what you're describing seems to me the route out of all of this I really mean that I feel like you the the education system starting Young And getting people emotionally engaged learning what they like what they don't like but then also teaching them about their emotional systems and how it helps them parse the world is really the solution so that when we're upset we can realize like yeah I'm upset it makes sense why I'm upset but let me explore it from the other side it also makes sense why they're upset and that seems to be what humans have done somewhat throughout history never perfectly well but it seems like it ought to be possible I mean the forebrain is there for a reason so could you um in in wanting to go back to a little bit of the biology and the research what have you seen in terms of cross-cultural consistency yeah about the role of emotions in it in our ability to parse and learn and um because obviously we're not going to solve these problems today but although I think you've shine light on some some potential Solutions I mean what do we know for sure about human beings and their capacity to do what you're describing to to Really um learn differently uh it worked in the classroom where you were teaching but how could each and every one of us do this I mean how would we approach this I guess I want to take this to the Practical um what can we do when we read a newspaper article what can we do when we we're on social media what can we do uh when our kid is like refusing to do something um because they simply don't like it or that the teacher they don't like the teacher are are there paths through that that you've identified or that you can sense work I can get funny examples of my own kids when they didn't like things at school right this isn't licensed yeah what tools do you use licensed to not well yeah so so my my son when he was in third grade he was he was very upset about the behavior chart that his teacher had at school right so he had a he had a behavior chart they had a behavior Charter back the room that the principal didn't agree with this but that teacher was there for a year and okay so there's this behavior chart and you have green you start on green with your little clip and then there's yellow and then there's red which is like call your parents which I I never understood why they don't put call your parents on the green but anyway right so you know you start on the green and then you get you get down to the yellow and they get around to red and you know there's Ted's little friend is always getting on the red by 9 A.M it's like can we just get it over with you know and and he tried to talk with his teacher about why this behavior chart made him so uncomfortable because and she couldn't she could not understand his perspective because she kept saying but you're always on green you're always doing what you're supposed to be doing and you're respectful and you're well behaved so why is it a problem and what he was trying to say was that somehow it just made him uncomfortable to have that there so he was constantly bothering me with this I finally told him I was trying to work one day and he was home from school because I would let him work from home some days because we needed to to kind of buffer a little bit and uh you know he'd bring all his work home and he'd do it himself I'd be working he'd be working right it's fine he had all kinds of projects going on you know and this is a kid who does a little Side Story there's a kid who went to first grade and about two weeks into first grade good first grade class he he was crying on a Sunday night to me like I can't go to school I don't want to go to school I'm like well what's you know what's wrong I'm thinking he's getting bullets and he's talking he's like I don't know he finally looks at me and he goes I have so much work to do how do you expect me to get my work done if I'm sitting in school all day I can relate right I can relate can you relate because you're actually a motivated right we take kids motivations and the things they're interested in and we sideline them and try to structure them into something so back there are Legos yeah oh he was he was way into building armor at that time he would yeah I know we're probably terrible parents but we gave him some safety glasses and we taught him how to use it and we explained how Metals sharp and we gave him some shoes that is super cool and some tin snips and he made a whole set of armor in the backyard at you know in second grade anyway it took him months and months I mean it chained mail the whole bit he was super into amazing you know anyway and he made airplane he did all kinds of things um but so here's this kid and he's bugging me about his teacher in this paper Trend I said Ted go write a letter to your teacher if it bothers you that much you go write a letter about why it bothers you right because in doing so he's first of all helping to solve the problem secondly he was he was formulating his understanding of what this behavior chart is and why specifically it bothers him and in so doing it helps him not be so bothered by it right so that's an example of something you could do right so he wrote this letter to his teacher which ended up being published in the National Academy of Science engineering and Matt's book how people learn volume two because I was on the committee of people that wrote it and we needed an example of kids making sense out of motivational things and actually took his name and the teacher's name off and put the letter in the book it basically is a little kid saying listen teacher when you put up this behavior chart he called it a bad behavior chart which it wasn't it was just a behavior chart but he interprets it as bad behavior when you put that up it's as if your you're daring me to do something bad you're you're basically he doesn't say it like this he says you're basically making me uncomfortable because you are laying out a perspective on me a possibility space for me that you're now bringing into the conversation that I could be like that and let's see if you're going to be oh not today oh we're still on green right and so where does this go it goes back to the idea that kids are and all of us are interpreting the interactions and the structures around us not only for what they are but for what they represent as somebody else's interpretation of what we are or are not capable of and he saw that behavior chart as a marker that his teacher assumed that all kids in that class are capable of being badly behaved and that their main aim of being in school is to be well behaved right and so he writes all about saying saying dear teacher every day I come to school every single day and every single day is new that's what he says and I could learn something new except then I see dot dot dot the bad behavior chart right he's saying school is supposed to be about learning and and US engaging and you're making it about something so low level and basic as are you going to behave yourself today we're we are insulting him by the way we frame the context so take it back to the bigger issues of Civic discourse and all these things I think so much of the way that we're organizing our lives our social relationships our community our Civic structures right now is mirroring that teacher's behavior chart right she take the chart down I don't no I don't think so and and what and I asked because I'm not sure that it matters I think what probably matters is that he had the chance to voice he voices his understanding yeah his understanding of the chart yeah that's right and now you know anybody can read his understanding of the story because in like uh you know the most you widely read textbook on learning right um and motivation I mean first is that we're structuring the way we structure our environment can unwittingly impose our mental models of other people's possibility spaces onto them and people find that inherently abhorrent right so think about how we're doing that in many contexts not simply in schools um and then the second thing is from the kids perspective deconstructing exactly why and something bothers you by understanding how it is that you are interpreting that thing then opens you up to be able to manage those spaces in a new way and to engage in them in a new way so if we take the conversation back to the idea of Civic discourse of Civic reasoning of engaging with with any idea right there are ideas that are deeply problematic there are ideas that are deeply hurtful that have long histories of trauma associated with them of long histories of power dynamics uh and oppression associated with them the way in which I think we deconstruct those ideas is going to be critical to how those ideas live on implicitly in our social relationships and our society if we cancel them if we negate them and pretend they don't exist all we're doing is burying them in a place where they can't be deconstructed and only by actually taking them apart and appreciating the pain the the relationship structures the limitation the resource allocations the inequities that are implicit in those Concepts only by deconstructing and deeply understanding those can we rebuild them in a different way so it's very difficult because on the one hand we have a space created for ourselves right now in society that is deeply unsafe for many people and when you're in an unsafe space you are not in a space that is conducive to constructing and deconstructing meaning using those default mode systems and other systems just to be crass about the brain right and kind of oversimplify it that are the substrate of autobiographical self of possibility spaces of ethics of deep uh moral and ethical emotions so on the one hand we have a space that is deeply unsafe for individuals to think together and genuinely so there are real implications for people to reveal certain kinds of identities to engage with certain kinds of ideas in culturally uh culturally um formulated spaces right that we've constructed together and the irony is that we can only fix that and create a different way of interacting with one another by actually boldly going in there together so it's a very nuanced line where we need to develop skills and this is where I think and many people think now that schools should be focused across disciplinary domains whether it's Math Science Social Studies history art the Arts right Sports should be focused on helping young people and teachers develop capacities and dispositions for deconstructing and constructing again safe uh safe cultural spaces to think together about you know interpretations about narratives about stories about assumptions about ideas because as we engage in those thoughts together we call that Civic discourse right we learn kind of rules for not triggering and sensibilities for not endangering another person's ability to engage on equal footing with us because if we trigger those unsafe right dangerous places for people they can't neurobiologically then engage with us deeply around sharing their perspective and deconstructing hours together to build something where we have a shared understanding in the middle we have to trust one another and Trust trusting one another really means we have to have a space established in which we can feel safe to deconstruct our own beliefs and to allow others to do the same and to assure them that we can engage with those beliefs no matter what they are and then actually exteriorize them and evaluate them together and think about them around core values we probably both hold like well-being like sustainability of society and of cultures and of groups right these things are core everyone wants to be well everyone wants to have a sustainable life and a Life future and a cultural set of values and so when we all appreciate that we're bringing those things to the table but then are systematic about constructing a space for civic discourse in which we are supporting one another and deconstructing our own beliefs rather than each other's bullies right then we are at a space where we can start to construct some kind of understanding some kind of nuanced more um uh adaptive more pro-social and the true sense way of engaging with one another with not necessarily a way of agreeing with one another but way of engaging and constructing and deconstructing meaning together so that we can be adaptive so that we can build a society where everyone can flourish so that we can build a society where everyone can belong and can uh can actually have the resources they need I would argue as long as free speech is not possible for everybody yeah that nobody yes that's right then nobody is safe nobody's safe and that there's an illusion of safety around the idea that um people who um who have voice uh are going to get what they want simply because they are the ones who are allowed to talk and other people aren't yeah I mean I think he said it perfectly when he said that anytime ideas get buried there's no way they can be solved yeah we know this from the scientific literature for instance the results within social science and biological science that are deeply troubling yeah um you know I can think of experiments that were done uh in the realm of neurosurgery on humans in the 1960s people stimulating different brain areas and seeing Rage or seeing very politically controversial ideas emerge from the person's mouth in real time as a function of stimulating that brain area and then you say well did they really believe that and they just never were saying it and the person doesn't even recall that happening during the surgery or I mean this idea that Jung had that we have all things inside of us yeah I think can be seen as a very dangerous notion and territory that we have all these Shadows but the the I'm also an optimist and I feel that the the optimistic view of it is that by knowing that we have all things inside of us potentially and by embracing that fact that we can manage that to steal what you just said we can manage that and that we can function so much better when we see something in the world that we think that's not me I'm not that and I hate that when if we understand that that also lives inside of us but that we just don't realize it uh and I realize some people hear this and they'll go that's not true you know I have my stances and I disagree with other things I would say absolutely yes but the difference between one person's stance and another person's stance is could be purely developmental wiring it could be um it could be a difference of having read different childhood books and oriented towards one book versus another I mean I don't I think that we are very similar at the level of core wiring and core algorithms that we run but somehow these days we have the perception that we've diverged so much I think the only thing that's really missing is what you're describing is is a place where any and all ideas can be explored freely not to establish consensus or validity of certain kinds of ideas but to actually exteriorize them and and deconstruct them for what they actually are absolutely um thank you for working through that that space because it's a tricky one it's very it's very fresh yeah it's very fraught um but so so very important I have a question that's very basic yeah um but I've never gotten a good answer on um I was raised thinking that mirror neurons were a real thing that there are these neurons that exist in the in the brains of Us and other Old World primates um like macaque monkeys um but especially in humans the the so-called mirror neurons that are activated when we see somebody experience something and it evokes a sort of empathic understanding um in US I've also seen some reviews written recently in some popular press saying that mirror neurons are perhaps not playing the the critical role that we thought they were um what's the story on mirror neurons um and uh we're not going after anybody's work in particular I just want to know whether or not there's real validity to this notion of mirror neurons I'm not an expert on it but I can tell you what I know about it and the way that um I think about it so I mean I think it's pretty clear now that there are no such things as mirror neurons like some special kind of cell type that's in the brain that they've not been found they were predicted but they were not found um but something else was also predicted back in the late 1980s um uh by Antonio DiMaggio um where he talked about the brain um in terms of being organized in terms of what he called convergent and Divergent zones so he talked about um the brain being organized as networks converging and then diverging again back out so you have places where processing is kind of coming together and then then what happens in there then determines how things get spread back out and you've got these sort of Loops happening in the brain and and his his thinking on that was very much um commensurate with others thinking about the notion of uh of goal directed action and perception so if you think back to developmental Scholars who had knew nothing about the brain very much like Jean Piaget right back in the early uh 20 20th century um where he was observing young children and noticing that they were interacting with the world and they expected certain things and they were he thought imposing theories or schemas onto the world and then and then accommodating was the word he used uh the world with their actions what it didn't act the way they expected and then assimilating that back right to change what they expected next time so that he had this model that he built from from systematically observing children uh three in particular right um where he what he realized is that kids are not just flailing around sort of discovering things haphazardly they're imposing a certain logic onto the world and then they're systematically testing that logic so their hypothesis basically yes right they they're expecting things and then when the world does what they want that reinforces and when it does something different that's surprising and then they have to accommodate and make sense and then they have to expect differently in the future so what does this have to do with mirror and irons I think when you bring these different ideas together that the psychological observational ideas and then the neurobiological ideas um what we basically have and I I wrote about this a little bit in like I think 2008 I have a paper called something like the smoke around mirror neurons and I forget the second half of the title but it has the word goals and and uh and directed actions and things right um the idea I think is is it's not that there are special neurons that are firing when we see another person do the thing right that but that we are it goes back to the notion of us imposing our expectations onto the world you have to share and understand intuitively the goal of the other one's action in order to activate these mirror regions right um uh where and what are those mural regions they are basically regions that are deeply interconnected with each other right they're thoroughly interconnected with each other in terms of white matter fiber tracts and they are regions involved in um Acts uh planning you know goal-oriented actions and perceiving the outcomes of those actions so it's a kind of a loop between acting and perceiving and acting and perceiving and and I argued at the time right that goals are emergent like high-level goals are emergent from the dynamic feedback loops of acting and perceiving right so I was really taking a very piagetian view but imposing that on the Neuroscience so I think you take what I'm saying together with like a piagetian constructivist view there are many other constructivist neuroscientists all a constructive psychologists also and and then also the neural data what we see is that we don't have these special neurons built into our head what we have is a natural proclivity and I don't know where that comes from right but we have a natural proclivity to try to appreciate another person's actions feelings experiences by leveraging our own similar actions feelings experience variances and so when we can share goals or experiences that becomes more facile right and that's been shown over and over in these mirror type papers right and when you uh distance yourself from those goals and actions or don't have an intuitive sense of them then you don't get these mirroring activations you don't get these kind of ramped up um uh sharing of of of of of goals right or of of experience so I think it really comes back to the way the nervous system is wired to be inherently social we are cultural Learners we are situated in Social spaces from the moment we're conceived and certainly from the moment we're born and that social space observing others interacting with others co-regulating each other's physiology each other's attention each other's um emotion right as we do those things we accommodate to each other and we wire ourselves to expect certain kinds of feelings and then to recognize those same things in other people and so as we share constructed experience together we start to appreciate the sameness right the the parallels between other peoples and our own emotions thoughts goals and and we can also uh dehumanize them you know make the other the other person not share our thoughts emotions goals and then we are capable of all kinds of horrible things we've talked about before right um where you're where you've actually distanced yourself so what's the scope on mirror neurons I don't think mirror neurons exist I think that's the consensus but our propensity to engage with other people by simulating on the substrate of our own self and then inferring the goals and the feelings and the outcomes and the experiences of those experiences that we've simulated that's what is very essential to being a human but keeping in mind that there's also this layer of learned lived cultural developed expectations we impose onto the world and we not filter but we um we steer our attention we steer our perception to accommodate to align with our expectations so it's never just the reality of what the person experienced or what happened it's always our perception of that reality as we expected it to happen so there's this very Dynamic cultural co-construction happening that is um that is messy that is iterative that you can learn learn to do in different ways in different contexts and and that's kind of how I understand this notion of mirroring before we conclude I do want to answer your son's question oh so so prior to recording um there was a text message that came we don't have to read it verbatim but the text message um uh Mary Ellen's son uh is uh late teenage years and he's been doing uh deliberate cold exposure cold showers on on a daily basis and reported that he's not get it he hasn't had any colds since starting this this is actually a pretty common experience because the pulse and adrenaline that is inevitable with a uncomfortably cold but safe in the morning does a whole bunch of exercises to get warm and then jumps in a freezing cold shower amazing um that Spike of adrenaline we know is neuroprotective if it's a short-lived spike in Adrenaline you know what chronically no you don't want chronic stress that's not good that's not good we know that from the beautiful worker Bruce McEwen and Bob sapolsky and others yeah so um but then he asked um should he get sick should he continue the cold showers and and the answer is no I think that um then it would be hot showers and hot baths and sauna type stuff is probably better but not so hot that it's stressful yeah you really want to reduce stress on a on an ill system yeah so um he sounds uh for many reasons like a remarkable young man as as is your daughter it sounds like a remarkable and listen and you're remarkable and I I really mean that I feel like we could go on forever exploring these ideas I I absolutely uh would love to have you back for another discussion or or many um about your research I want to thank you for taking the time of your research schedule your teaching schedule to come educate us today these ideas are so vitally important and and you provide so many real world examples in fact it's one of the things that I love so much about your work is that it's really nested in real world applications thank you and your thoughts and perspectives on the education and how it could be better at the level of educating kids at home teaching ourselves teachers and the education system I I hope will ring far and wide um because they they really can be implemented we're not talking about the need to purchase a bunch of stuff no we need to start with a different disposition we need to start with a different goal yeah the goal of Education needs to not learning is not the goal it's not the outcome it needs to be the development of the person right how is a person changing themselves Having learned this and then you design the learning opportunities to change who people are capable of becoming right so the learning is there but it's not the end point it's just the means to something else which we haven't been attending to enough and that's the development of the person who they become Having learned that beautifully but um well thank you so much for your time thank you so much for the work you do and I can't wait to have another discussion with you about the emerging research great I'll be back thank you thank you for joining me today

Title: AMA #7: Cold Exposure, Maximizing REM Sleep & My Next Scientific Studies
Published: 2023-05-31 12:00:26 UTC
Description:
Welcome to a preview of the seventh Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an ask me anything episode, or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at zero-cost to everybody on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and elsewhere. We also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere, research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar of the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny Foundation has agreed to match that amount. So now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe. Or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one-time payment. And again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium. For those of you that are already subscribers to the premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium subscription feed. And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you. Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question asks, is it possible to get a cold or to get sick from deliberate cold exposure? And I suppose a related question is, should you even do deliberate, cold exposure if you have a sniffle, a cold, or a flu? I get that question all the time as well. So answer both of those questions. And I will also touch on some of the immune enhancing effects of deliberate cold exposure. But just to make sure that we answer the specific question asked here right off the bat, is it possible to get a cold or to get sick from deliberate cold exposure? Well, assuming that you're not doing the deliberate cold exposure for more than, say five or six minutes at one stretch, probably not directly from the deliberate cold exposure. I mention that because most people are doing anywhere from about a minute to three minutes, sometimes five or six minutes. And maybe for those of you that are really pushing it, 10 minutes of deliberate cold exposure. And most often after doing that deliberate cold exposure, people are either getting clothed, or they're getting into a sauna, or they're taking a hot shower, and then getting clothed and heading off into their day or off to sleep depending on what time of day or night you happen to do your deliberate cold exposure. We can safely say that if you warm up after a relatively brief, meaning one minute to, let's extend out to 10 minutes, 10-minute deliberate cold exposure, although, I really want to caution people to not do 10-minute deliberate cold exposure right off the bat. If you are somebody who is not accustomed to it, don't jump right up to that long exposure to cold water. Start with shorter exposures. But if you're doing that one-to-10-minute deliberate, cold exposure, and then you're getting warm afterwards and heading about your day, I can't see how the deliberate cold exposure itself would enhance your susceptibility to getting sick. That said, we know from an enormous number of studies that have looked at cold virus transmission and other forms of viral and bacterial transmission that the environment that you happen to be in does impact your susceptibility to colds and other types of viruses and to bacterial infections in the following way. There have been controlled studies in which people go into laboratories. Those laboratories have rooms, which they can very tightly control the humidity, so essentially, the water content in the air, as well as the temperature in the room. And if you look at the total mass of those data, we can say a couple of specific things in kind of bullet point fashion. First off, cold, dry air does seem to increase our susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Because whether or not you're a mouth breather or a nose breather, and by the way, I suggest everyone be a nose breather unless you're exercising hard enough that you have to breathe through your mouth, or you're talking or something of that sort. But if you're a nose breather or a mouth breather or both, viruses and bacteria enter through your nose and mouth, sometimes through your eyes, but your nose and mouth are going to be the main sites of entry and your main barriers to viral and bacterial infections. In fact, one of the ways you are constantly fighting off bacterial and viral infections that you're exposed to all the time is by way of those viruses and bacteria getting trapped in the mucous lining of your nose or your mouth, most notably in the back of your throat. So if you spend time in cold, dry environments, there is a tendency for that mucosal lining to be thinner. There is a tendency for that mucosal lining to not be as robust in general. And when I say robust, what I mean is that if your mouth breathing, for instance in a cold, dry environment, I'm thinking from the time I spent in Cambridge, Massachusetts in winter at the T station. If you're I'm just imagining myself because it was so darn cold back there breathing through your mouth or having gone for a run, and your mouth isn't covered, or even if you're deliberately nasal breathing, you are drying out your nasal passages and making them more susceptible to infections. Does that necessarily mean that every time you go out in cold, dry air that you're going to get an infection? No, of course it doesn't. But to relate this back to the question we have before, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact that more humid, warm environments are going to make your mucosal lining and the general upper respiratory area more, I don't want to say immune because I don't want to conflate that word with the other meaning of immune. It's going to make it more robust against bacterial and viral infections. So if you get into a cold shower or a cold plunge or a cold ocean or a cold lake, and then you get out, and you're out there shivering and shaking, trying to boost your metabolism or whatever it is that you're doing it for, and it's cold, dry air, and especially if your mouth breathing in that cold, dry air, yes, I could see how that might lead to a higher probability of getting a cold or other type of infection. But there's nothing specific about the deliberate, cold exposure itself that can induce a cold or other type of infection assuming that the water is clean, right? We're not talking about bacterial infections of cuts on the skin, et cetera. We're talking about colds and other forms of being sick, namely upper respiratory infections. OK, now with that said, I often get asked whether or not for people who already have a little sniffle, they're feeling a little run down or perhaps a lot run down, should they do deliberate cold exposure? And what's a little tricky to give a one size fits all answer, , but I think we can safely say that if you are feeling malaise, if you're feeling like you have to rest you're tired, you're not feeling good because of a cold or because of a flu or because of a bacterial infection, now, I'm not saying just feeling not good, I'm saying feeling not good due to a cold or other form of virus or bacterial infection, then I would say stay out of deliberate, cold exposure. Don't use it. Now, why would I say that? Given the data I'll talk about in a few minutes showing that regular deliberate cold exposure if done correctly, can in fact increase immune system markers and perhaps even make you much more robust to combating different types of infection through the release of adrenaline. We'll talk about what all that looks like in a moment in terms of protocols and some of the science. But to just be very clear and very direct, if you're sick, stay out of deliberate cold exposure. There, I, would instead recommend warmer hot baths warmer hot showers, the sauna, et cetera. But I also would caution that if you are getting into saunas that are too hot, saunas they're so hot that it's stressful for you, and again, a lot of people use deliberate heat exposure because of the stress it induces, they're doing some heat induced, for instance, heat shock proteins and different ways of increasing heart rate. That's a different sort of thing. That's hard, stressful in order to generate an adaptation. I don't recommend doing that. In fact, I don't recommend doing deliberate cold exposure, exercise, or deliberate heat exposure if you're feeling really not well. Now, if you're feeling just a little bit not well, you're feeling a little bit rundown, a little bit of sniffle, a little bit of malaise, well then, it's kind of an edge case where we could say, all right you know what? Just take a hot shower and go to sleep. That's probably the best advice, that good old-fashioned advice. But if you are determined to do your deliberate cold exposure anyway, then I would say definitely get warm or take a hot shower afterwards, hot bath, or hot sauna, but, not too hot that it's stressful, of course. And keep in mind that one of the variables that's been measured quite a lot in laboratory studies of deliberate cold exposure is the increase in immune system markers. So I'll provide a few links to some of these studies. Although, nowadays there are many, many of them. But it's very clear that deliberate cold exposure can increase the release and the production of different immune molecules and immune cells. One slightly older study, but nonetheless a good study that has relevance here is entitled "Immune system of cold exposed and cold adapted humans." Keep in mind that this study is a little bit extreme. And there are reasons for that. I guess to make a long story short, oftentimes, in order to quote unquote "see an effect in a study," scientists will use conditions that are pretty extreme compared to control group. Oftentimes, you'll see a dose response to, but it's a little bit trickier to do with human studies of deliberate, cold exposure. It can be done, but not too common. But here, they used a pretty what I would call extreme stimulus. It was exposing people to 14 degrees Celsius water, so that's 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn't that cold. It's like cool, I would say very cool water, but not what you might consider cold depending on how well you tolerate cold. And that will vary, of course. But they had people exposed to that for an hour, which is a pretty long time. Most people, as I mentioned, are using colder temperatures of deliberate cold exposure, so even high 30s, low 40s, maybe upper 40s for anywhere from one to 10 minutes, depending on how conditioned they are. And again, don't just jump into 10 minutes of deliberate, cold exposure, please at 35 degrees or 40 degrees or even 45 degrees if you aren't familiar with deliberate cold exposure. You have to ease into these sorts of things over time. And if you're interested in protocols for deliberate cold exposure, we have a zero-cost newsletter at hubermanlab.com. Go to the Menu, go to Newsletter, and you can find that. We've done several episodes on deliberate cold exposure. In any event, this study, "Immune system of cold exposing cold adapted humans," as I mentioned, had people in 14 degrees Celsius water for one hour. And basically what they found is that one exposure to cold did not change immune system function in any kind of significant way. However, what they found was if people did deliver cold exposure repeatedly over a period of about six weeks, and by repeatedly, I mean three times per week, what they found were trends. And again, trends are not statistically significant, but trends towards increases in plasma concentrations of things like IL 6, interleukin 6 or total numbers of T lymphocytes and T helper cells and T suppressor cells and activated T and B lymphocytes, these are all immune cells and immune molecules that roughly correspond to an increase in immune system function. If you'd like to learn more about the immune system, I did an episode on immune system function. Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com. And it spells out the basic cell types of what's called the innate and the adaptive immune system. This study, which we will link to in the show note captions is but one study of several other studies showing that deliberate cold exposure can increase immune system markers, especially when deliberate cold exposure is done repeatedly over time, so in this case, three times a week over a period of six weeks. But again, I want to highlight these aren't highly significant effects. These are trends in the direction of increased numbers of immune cells and immune markers. Now, what's impossible to know is how those trends translate to actual resistance to specific concentrations of, say cold virus or flu virus or any other virus or bacteria. That would be great, but that's a very difficult study to do, especially in the context of deliberate cold exposure as well. Now, we can all be scientists about this and say, what is it about deliberate cold exposure that would increase immune system function? And there, we can confidently say the molecules epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are released in both brain and body in response to cold water exposure, as well as things like deliberate hyperventilation, the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine into the brain and body is known to have a number of different effects related to the immune system. It can be pro-immune, at least in the short term. And in the long term, meaning if noradrenaline and adrenaline, again those are just different names for norepinephrine and epinephrine. I'm sorry, those are the same thing, but that's why I use them interchangeably so that you don't get confused. If you see noradrenaline or norepinephrine, that's the same thing you hear, epinephrine or adrenaline, same thing. Deliberate cold exposure or deliberate hyperventilation will increase those molecules, norepinephrine and epinephrine. And their increase is pro-immune. It can trigger the activation of immune cells and immune molecules that can make you more resistant to certain forms of infection. However, if norepinephrine and epinephrine are elevated chronically, and especially if they are elevated late in the day repeatedly over many, many days, that can cause reductions in the number and efficiency of immune cells in combating infections. So getting cold in this context of whether or not you can get sick from it should really be considered more as what happens when you spike your adrenaline and norepinephrine? And there's one other study that we can look to, which is now really a famous study published in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looking at so-called Wim Hof breathing. But really, that just translates to cyclic hyperventilation. So this is inhaling through nose, exhaling through the mouth repeatedly 25 times or so. [BREATHING] If you do that, you notice you feel quite warm, lots to do with some things relate to vasodilation, has some things to do with release of norepinephrine. And epinephrine, we know that pattern of deliberate hyperventilation, much like deliberate cold exposure, deploys or releases noradrenaline and adrenaline into your brain and body. And we know from this study entitled "Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans" showed really nicely, I think. That if people are injected with E. coli, a bacteria it's actually an end-- they did this through endotoxin injections. People got really sick. They'd get feel like they had the flu, they vomit, diarrhea, get a fever, et cetera. However if they did the sorts of breathing that I talked about just a moment ago, prior to that, they were able to ward off a lot of the symptoms associated with the endotoxin infection. And you would say, OK wow, their immune system just fired up, and they were able to fight it off. But it's trickier than that, actually. What happened was the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from cyclic hyperventilation, which is really what [BREATHING] really is, cyclic hyperventilation, also called Wim Hof breathing, also called tummo breathing, et cetera, that actually had a suppressive action on certain arms of the immune system in a way that allowed people to avoid symptomology such as fever, nausea, et cetera. And we would imagine the same thing would occur with deliberate cold exposure done prior to bacterial infection or viral exposure. So if you're sensing that I'm saying two things at once, I am. I'm saying deliberate cold exposure, and cyclic hyperventilation can both cause deployment of molecules such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that lead to enhanced immune system function if done repeatedly. I'm also saying that increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine too much can suppress your immune system. In this study, the PNAS study that I mentioned a moment ago, that suppression of the immune response was actually one of the reasons people avoided symptomology. But they were still injected with endotoxin, so they just weren't fighting off the endotoxin with fever. Remember, fever is an adaptation to fight infection. It's designed essentially to heat up the infection and kill it. So what are we to take away from this? Here are what I think are the key takeaways. One, if you are feeling good to great, do your deliberate cold exposure. And perhaps don't worry so much about using your body's natural metabolism and thermogenic abilities to heat back up afterwards. But I don't suggest anyone ever allow themselves to stay really cold after deliberate cold exposure for more than 10, 15 minutes or maybe half an hour, right? Get bundled back up, or put on clothes. If it's a nice hot, sunny day, get out in the sun and warm up. Again, temperatures and conditions will vary for different people, different locations, et cetera. If you are not feeling great, you're feeling a little rundown, and you really want to do your deliberate cold exposure, do it, but then warm up really well afterwards. Maybe even drink some hot tea or other fluid afterwards as well. And if you are not feeling good, you're feeling malaise, you're feeling run down. Despite what you read about deliberate, cold exposure or cyclic hyperventilation, allowing for the deployment of immune molecules or increasing the number of immune cells that you're making, avoid anything that's stressful or challenging whether or not it's a cold challenge, a heat challenge, or an exercise challenge when you're feeling run down. Because under those conditions, what you really want to do is slow your circulation down, probably find and take a little walks or something provided you're not doubled over in bed and vomiting, and things like that. A little bit of movement, probably good to circulate your blood. But in general, the advice that you get to rest when you're sick and not push yourself, that's really good advice because you want all of your body's resources to be devoted to getting over that infection. And if you're interested in sickness and sickness behavior and the sorts of behaviors that can combat infection, check out the episode I did on the immune system. We'll link to it in the show note captions. Because it talks about how when we have a viral or bacterial infection, a whole set of brain circuits get activated that encourage us to be more in the fetal position, to move less, to be eyes down, to kind of slump down. That's not a coincidence. That's because of the activation of these so-called sickness circuits that are really designed to help you heal yourself. So I both apologize, and what do the kids say? Sorry, not sorry. Don't apologize for the somewhat nuanced answer here. Because a lot of information out there says, oh, cold boosts your immune system. And yeah, that's true under certain conditions. It can also deplete your immune system and limit your ability to fight off infections under other conditions. And perhaps the last thing to say about this is that I am a big believer in using nasal breathing whenever you don't have to breathe through your mouth. So if you're exercising hard, by all means breathe through your mouth. If you're doing martial arts, and it requires that you breathe through your mouth, go ahead and do that. But if you're doing, say a zone two cardio, low level cardio, or you're just walking along, it's very clear based on a growing amount of data that being a nasal breather is better than being a mouth breather. And there are a number of different reasons for that we've talked about on the podcast and elsewhere. But one of the additional reasons is a main site of entry for infections is through the mouth. So keep that mouth shut unless you need to talk. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast and to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools, for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs you can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Adderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-05-29 12:00:44 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse and other stimulants work to increase focus and treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we're discussing stimulants in particular stimulants for the treatment of ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as many of you know there is tremendous interest in drugs like Adderall Ritalin Vyvanse and other stimulants as well as non-stimulant prescription drugs that have been shown to improve the symptoms of ADHD such as modafinil or modafinil and guanfacine today I'm going to discuss all of these compounds in the context of how they work to improve the symptoms of ADHD I'm going to address common questions about these compounds such as are they just speed are they similar to meth or Methamphetamine I'll talk about their addictive potential as well as their potential to cause psychotic symptoms both in the short and long term and of course I will talk about the scientific literature surrounding the most frequently Asked question about these compounds which is what are the long-term consequences of taking any of them in childhood or in adulthood now today's discussion centers around the use of these compounds both for childhood and for adult ADHD but of course I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that there are a tremendous number of people that use these prescription drugs without a prescription in order to improve their ability to focus and indeed also use them recreationally in fact some surveys reveal that as high as 80 percent of college-age young adults have used one or several of prescription drugs such as adderall Ritalin Vyvanse or similar at some point and are doing so without a prescription so they are either obtaining those drugs from those that do have prescriptions for them for ADHD or they are obtaining them through Black Market sources which of course carries an additional and very serious risk related to the so-called fentanyl crisis that is as high as 75 percent of black market drugs nowadays of various kinds but certainly including the sorts of drugs we're going to talk about today are contaminated with fentanyl and therefore are very deadly so today I'm going to describe what these various drugs really are how they work at the level of neurons and brain networks and how they change those brain networks in ways that really can allow people with ADHD to be able to focus better I will answer the common question which is why is it that giving children speed because indeed several not all but several of the compounds I'm going to discuss are speed they are amphetamine why would that cause a reduction in hyperactivity if speed is a stimulant so I'll answer that question for you and I will also answer questions that are commonly asked such as how these drugs impact things like sleep hormone Health reproductive Health as well as what is their impact on height indeed it was one prominent hypothesis that these ADHD meds could actually restrict the height of children I'll tell you whether or not that's actually true or not and I'll discuss the data surrounding whether or not these drugs predispose people to becoming addicts to other substances even if people cease or continue taking the stimulants that can help them in the clinical sense for a ADHD before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nui venison Maui Nui venison is the most nutrient-dense red meat available Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA certified wild harvesting system to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui the solution they built turns the proliferation of an invasive species into a wide range of nutrient-dense products from fresh butcher cuts and organ Meats to bone broth and jerky I'm a particular fan of their bone broth which has an unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100 calories and I also love the ground venison and the venison steaks talked many times before on this podcast with expert guests in nutrition who make it clear that we should all be getting at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day with Maui Nui venison products that's extremely easy to do and they're extremely delicious as well if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison go

Us by hvmn Ketone IQ Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones now most people have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet but most people including myself are not on the ketogenic diet that is I and most people eat complex carbohydrates fruits and things of that sort in addition to Quality proteins Etc it turns out that even if you're not following a ketogenic diet increasing your blood ketones can still have benefits so for instance I use Ketone IQ anytime I want to do extended bouts of focused work preparing for podcasts research writing grants and if I ever want to exercise but I don't have time to eat or I don't want to have my gut full of food taking Ketone IQ and thereby increasing my blood ketones allows me to do cognitive work or physical workouts without getting hungry and with plenty of energy and cognitive Focus if you'd like to try Ketone IQ you can go to hvmn.com huberman to save 20 off again that's hvmn.com huberman I'm pleased to announce that I

tickets I hope to see you there let's talk about treatments for ADHD and why stimulant treatments in particular can be so effective first of all it's long been known that there are specific brain networks involved in what we call attention now attention is not one thing actually it involves several different cognitive operations including the suppression of noise that is turning down the background chatter in our heads and turning down our attending to things outside us like noises or visual cues that are not relevant to what we want to do and it also involves ramping up or attending we're focusing on particular things that are happening either in our immediate environment or in our head or both so if that all sounds rather complex indeed it is it involves several different networks operating in parallel but what we know for sure based on a lot of clinical and scientific laboratory data is that the so-called prefrontal cortex the region of neural real estate in your brain just behind your forehead is critically important for orchestrating which neural circuits are going to be more or less active at a given moment in order to bring about what we call Focus or attention or task switching or our ability indeed to multitask because we can actually multitask to some extent in fact if you were to look at somebody and focus on perhaps the expression on their face you could do that while also attending to a conversation that's happening nearby it's energetically demanding it's hard to do but we can do that that's actually referred to as covert attention you're covertly paying attention to something else and then you can switch that attention back to just one thing or one small collection of things the point being that attention is a powerful resource it's what allows us to navigate through life with efficiency and to be adaptive in our behaviors it's what allows us to learn and to build relationships and have successful School careers and professional careers and so on but it is indeed expensive it takes metabolic resources you know just at rest if you were to think about essentially nothing or whatever just pops into your mind with no dedicated effort toward paying attention to anything your brain would consume about 25 of your daily caloric needs and then when you lump on top of that your need or your attempts to focus on things to pay attention to specific things should come as no surprise as to why that often can make us feel tired as if we've been working really hard and we've been running a quote unquote mental marathon when trying to learn and attend to things it's hard work for the brain and yet we can pay attention because of that very precious real estate just behind our foreheads the prefrontal cortex now in people both children and adults that have ADHD their prefrontal cortex is not necessarily deficient in any specific way except that it is not as good at orchestrating the activity of other brain networks operating in parallel with it what do I mean by that well if we take a step back and say what is the prefrontal cortex really doing the prefrontal cortex has this amazing ability through what's called top-down inhibition to quiet other brain areas so for instance if you are feeling agitated but you need to sit still your ability to sit still even if it takes a bit of work is coordinated by your prefrontal cortex sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals to the networks of your brain that are trying to generate physical action in addition to that if you are in a conversation that's either a difficult one or a boring one or you are tempted to interrupt and you are actively holding back your desire to walk away or to yawn or to blurt something out it's your prefrontal cortex that is controlling that active suppression so in many ways you can just think of the prefrontal cortex as an Orchestra conductor that is essentially saying shh or not right now be quiet this is not the time to many different brain networks all at once now in addition to that your prefrontal cortex is coordinating with other brain networks that are involved in generating what's called salience or attention to particular signals so the prefrontal cortex in many ways is like a teacher or an Orchestra conductor it can point to in the neurochemical sense that is 0.2 a given brain structure and say you I'd like to hear more from you right now yes you the student in the back speak up and a moment later point to a collection of small students chattering in the back again I'm presenting all this by analogy and say hey hey you guys quiet down right now so and so is going to come up to the front of the room and help us work through this particular math problem so when we hear that the prefrontal cortex exerts what's called executive function what that refers to is the prefrontal cortex's ability to quiet the activity of particular neural circuits and to enhance or increase the salience of other neural circuits that are involved in creating our Spotlight of attention and what we know for sure based on many many brain Imaging studies is that ADHD is not necessarily A deficit in prefrontal cortical function but rather the prefrontal cortex's ability to communicate with other brain areas in the proper ways and so what results in the brain of a person either young or old with ADHD is that a lot of the background chatter becomes very very loud so for instance we have a brain Network called the default mode Network this is a fascinating brain Network this is the brain Network that is active when you just sort of sit in place and don't think about much and then you start having ideas about what you might do next week it tends to be very autobiographical so you might remember an experience from the past you might think about some of your desires some of your dislikes this default mode Network as it's called is also involved in our imagination our in our spooling together of different experiences that we've had it doesn't tend to be the thing that's really focused on anything external in particular all at once the default mode network is always active but it's when we start to attend to something especially things external to us like it you know something written on a page or a conversation or something that we really need to learn something we need to pay attention to that the activity of the default mode network is suppressed somewhat and that suppression occurs not just by accident but because the prefrontal cortex is actively suppressing it in kids and adults with ADHD the default mode network is often still active at a very robust level even while we're trying to attend to things and that's why someone with ADHD will sit down and try and do some focused work and I'll start thinking about something they want or something they dislike their internal state will start to distract them and of course there are other networks in the brain there's actually a what's called a true salience Network there's the dorsal attention Network there are a bunch of different networks and brain areas but again when thinking about ADHD and especially when thinking about how the drugs that we're going to talk about today work to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and in thinking about why so many people use or even abuse these drugs for sake of learning or recreationally we might say you start to realize that everything centers back to the prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex's ability to actively suppress and actively enhance the activity of these multiple brain networks including default mode networks aliens Network dorsal attention Network Etc so rather than overwhelm you with a bunch of names of brain areas and brain networks today I'd really like our discussion to focus on first what the various drugs that are used to treat ADHD are that is how do they work at the level of neurons second how they create a certain set of conditions that allow their prefrontal cortex to be a better conductor third how that can be leveraged during development to actually teach the prefrontal cortex of a young child to learn to be a better conductor because that's really the Hallmark of the use of these drugs is to try and enhance the activity of particular circuits to create a sort of learning so that the prefrontal cortex is much more efficient at doing its job of conducting and then fourth we're going to talk about the various things that I think most people out there ask about when they hear about drugs like Adderall Vyvanse and Ritalin Etc which is you know are they addictive why are they addictive can one use them briefly or even from time to time and still be okay what if I use them as a child and I don't want to be on them anymore should I put my child on these drugs Etc it is I believe only by understanding the biology of how these drugs work and their potential both to improve brain function but also some of the dangers associated with these drugs that one can really answer those questions for themselves or for their children okay so let's start with a very basic but critical question which is why in the world would amphetamines speed or other stimulants improve the symptoms of ADHD that's so critical to answer because if you think about it the prefrontal cortex needs to coordinate the actions of these other circuits and so just increasing the amount of activity in prefrontal cortex you can imagine would create a state of hyper Focus perhaps but actually that's not the case if you just were to ramp up the activity of prefrontal Cortex what you would find is that somebody would become even less efficient at paying attention to what they wanted to rather they would pay attention to whatever was presented in front of them with laser focus they would lock on to essentially anything and that's not good one of the key things about prefrontal cortex is that it needs to be flexible it needs to be able to pay attention to this then it needs to be able to pay attention to that then it needs to go back to paying attention to the thing it was paying attention to previously and so on and so forth life that is an effective adaptive life a good life consists of self-directing one's attention most all of the time so why would stimulants do that well almost all not all but almost all of the drugs used to treat ADHD fall under the category of stimulants or what are called sympathomimetics sympathomimetic refers to the fact that we naturally have a component of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system the autonomic nervous system has two major components one is called the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy has everything to do with ramping up our level of attention and arousal it is the so-called fight or flight aspect of our nervous system or rather it mediates fight or flight but immediates a bunch of other things too including sexual arousal including excitement and focus about something that we want to learn or somebody that we want to learn more about or remembering a phone number or anything that puts us into a state of alertness and focus the other arm of the autonomic nervous system is the so-called parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system and that's often referred to as the so-called rest and digest component of our nervous system and yes it controls rest indeed it puts us into sleep and yes it's involved in digestion but it's involved in a bunch of other things as well including sexual arousal including rates of digestion including salivation including all sorts of things that don't just have to do with resting and digesting the way to think about the autonomic nervous system is it's a sort of seesaw so it's always at a balance someplace between either predominantly sympathetic or predominantly parasympathetic but both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system are always active all the time it's not as if one is completely active and the others shut off even in sleep your sympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off and even during a panic attack your parasympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off drugs to treat ADHD which are fall under the category of stimulants are sympathomimetics because they trigger the release of neurochemicals and the activation of components of our nervous system that very much resemble the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous system the one that makes us more alert and more aroused so that's why they're called sympathomimetics and the word stimulant refers to a general category of drugs that are sympathomimetics now the most commonly discussed sympathomimetic is one that fortunately is not prescribed for ADHD and that's methamphetamine these days we hear a lot about meth meth which is methylated amphetamine is an extremely potent sympathomimetic and it has tremendous abuse potential Believe It or Not meth or Methamphetamine is actually available as a prescription drug but it is used very rarely because of its high abuse potential and all the terrible things that it can do in terms of cardiovascular health in terms of oral health right there's this stereotype that meth users have very degraded teeth and indeed they do there's a reason for that related to how meth impacts the brain and body I'm going to talk a little bit about methamphetamine a little bit later but let's just Place methamphetamine high on the Shelf as the most potent sympathomimetic that's out there because even though it's not often prescribed for ADHD there are class of compounds very similar to it that have a very similar pattern of action that is not quite as potent but that leverages the same underlying mechanisms and they are very commonly prescribed for ADHD namely Adderall and Vyvanse so first let's talk about Adderall and what Adderall is Adderall is a combination of what are called amphetamine salts amphetamine salts refers to the fact that there are two major forms of amphetamine there's a d amphetamine or dexoramphetamine and levo amphetamine or L amphetamine so I'll refer to these as D and L amphetamine and for you chemistry-minded folks out there the D and the L also refer to the fact that there is a l left-handed version of the molecule and there's a d or right-handed version of the molecule this is only important to understand insofar as you know that the D and the L forms of the molecule look very similar but they're mirror images of one another and yet they can have very different actions in the brain and body so Adderall is a three to one ratio of D amphetamine to L amphetamine you should know that L amphetamine tends to be less potent in increasing certain neurochemicals in the brain I'll talk about which neurochemicals they are in a moment then is D amphetamine so D amphetamine is potent stuff not as potent as methamphetamine but very potent stuff l-amphetamine a little bit less potent L amphetamine tends to be the amphetamine that increases blood pressure and heart rate what we call peripheral effects because it happens in the periphery outside the central nervous system peripheral effects like increased heart rate increased blood pressure sweating Etc are mostly activated by L amphetamine whereas D amphetamine tends to work mainly on receptors in the brain and therefore have effects mainly restricted to the brain now what are these effects that I've been referring to the major effect of Adderall and other sympathomimetic stimulants is to increase the activity of two neurochemicals the first of those neurochemicals is dopamine and the other of those neurochemicals is norepinephrine first off I want to be clear that when I say norepinephrine I could just as easily say nor adrenaline because those are the exact same thing and forgive me even though I wasn't the one to name the same thing two different things I'll try and stay with norepinephrine but I may say noradrenaline they are the same thing there's a whole story as to how they got named two different things but it's the same thing the major effect of Adderall and other sympathomimetic stimulants is to increase the transmission of dopamine and norepinephrine so what does dopamine and what is neuropinephrine well both dopamine and norepinephrine are what are called neuromodulators that is they have the ability to increase or decrease the firing patterns the electrical activity of particular brain circuits both dopamine and norepinephrine have separate roles in creating certain States within our brain and body but they like to collaborate meaning they tend to be released at similar locations in the brain in order to deliver us to a particular state of mind and or body so if we were to take a look at just dopamine we would find that dopamine is released at sites within the brain and increases the activity of brain networks that for the most part lead to increases in motivation Pursuit and to some extent mood if we were to look at norepinephrine and where it's released in the brain it tends to be released at many not all but many of the same sites where dopamine is released and the main function of norepinephrine is to increase the activity of neural networks that are involved in attention and focus to particular things in our environment okay so think of dopamine and norepinephrine as collaborators because indeed they are and actually they're very neurochemically similar as well it actually just takes one chemical conversion to turn dopamine into norepinephrine so they are very similar they're like close cousins that work together to help us achieve a common goal that involves increased motivation focus and alertness so when we talk about attention in ADHD or we talk about quieting the hyperactivity or impulsivity of ADHD one of the reasons why drugs that are effective in treating ADHD are so effective is because they increase motivation focus and alertness and they tend to do that at very focal locations in the brain it's worth taking a couple of minutes to think about how sympathomimetics such as adderall actually increase dopamine and norepinephrine they do so by affecting a couple of specific operations at the so-called synapse what are synapses synapses are the communication points between neurons they're actually the spaces between neurons but that's where a lot of the action is when neurons as we say are stimulating the next neuron or activating the next neuron or inhibiting the next neuron the word neuron just simply refers to nerve cell and so what nerve cells have is they have a cell body that contains their DNA and a bunch of other stuff they have a long wire like process which is referred to as an axon and at the end of that axon there are a bunch of proteins in there that do really interesting things so for instance there are proteins down at the end of the axon that package neurotransmitter into little spherical things that we call vesicles those vesicles can fuse with the end of the axon and vomit the contents those neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft into that little space between neurons and then if enough of those neurotransmitters bind to receptors on What's called the postsynaptic side which simply means the neuron on the other side well then the next neuron will become active and then the signal will propagate from one neuron to the next now I just described that whole process pretty quickly and I like to think pretty simply but it actually involves a lot of different protein bits and some pretty complex Machinery in order to make that happen I don't want to over complicate our conversation but what I will tell you is that down in the synapse in the presynaptic terminal the neuron that is going to release neurotransmitter there are what are called Transporters which sit there and suck up or suck back up some of the neurotransmitter that's been released there are dopamine Transporters and there are norepinephrine or noradrenergic Transporters down in the synapse what Adderall does and what other sympathomimetics do is to inhibit or disrupt the action of those Transporters and the net consequence of that is that when dopamine and or epinephrine are released into the synapse more of it is allowed to stick around and to binder receptors on the postsynaptic cell than would be the case if Adderall or the other stimulant were not present in the system so one way that Adderall increases dopamine and norepinephrine is by disrupting the activity of these presynaptic Transporters for dopamine and norepinephrine the other way that Adderall increases dopamine and norepinephrine is that it disrupts the activity of a different piece of Machinery in the presynaptic neuron which is called a vmat the vesicle monoamine transporter 2. if you really want to get specific you don't have to remember these names but what these vmats do is actually really cool what they do is they actually take whatever transmitter has been brought back up into the cell by Transporters and they package it into those vesicles that are then going to be released by disrupting the Transporters that vacuum back up some of the dopamine or norepinephrine that's been released and by also disrupting the packaging of dopamine and norepinephrine into vesicles themselves what ends up happening is that there's a buildup of a lot more dopamine and norepinephrine in the presynaptic terminal so that when an electrical signal travels down the neuron now the total amount of dopamine and norepinephrine that's released is increased okay so what's happening when you take Adderall is that you're getting more out of the dopamine and norepinephrine that you're releasing and you're releasing more dopamine and norepinephrine altogether and there's a third mechanism by which Adderall increases the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine present in synapses and therefore can act on other neurons and that has to do with disruption of the entire network between these different proteins I'm not going to go into that in any detail because it gets somewhat complicated in terms of the cell biology and some of the biochemistry down at the tips of these axons but suffice to say that Adderall is such an effective sympathomimetic that is it can increase dopamine to such a great extent especially compared to other treatments for ADHD because of its ability to increase dopamine release and transmission and therefore action as well as noradrenergic release and transmission and action down there in the synapse and it's worth pointing out that most of the effect of Adderall is an increasing dopamine as opposed to norepinephrine it does increase norepinephrine but its major effects we should say the major effects that have made it such an attractive drug to so many people both for the treatment of ADHD and for people to take recreationally or off prescription or for sake of studying or work simply because they want to focus more and longer is because of its ability to increase dopamine to such a great extent I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be in the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 now a bit earlier I mentioned that L amphetamine levo amphetamine is present in Adderall but at one quarter the amount of D amphetamine okay so there's a little bit of l-amphetamine and a lot of damphetamine in Adderall many of you are probably familiar with vivance Vyvanse is a commercial name for what many people think is extended release Adderall but actually Vyvanse is not extended release Adderall Vivant is a drug in which the pharmaceutical industry has taken one component of Adderall just the D amphetamine component and attached to it an amino acid called lysine now the amino acid lysine is a big amino acid and the attaching of Lysine to D amphetamine what we call vivance makes it what's called a pro drug it actually can't have any effect on its own but when one takes Vyvanse and it's broken down in the gut but to a greater extent actually in the bloodstream the lysines are cleaved off slowly over time and as a consequence Vyvanse is basically timed release dmphetamine this is important because I think a lot of people think that Adderall which again is D amphetamine and L amphetamine and those two things operate quite a bit differently at the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine and cardiac versus brain effects a lot of people think Vyvanse is just slow release Adderall but it is not what vivance is is D amphetamine only but in time release form and Vyvanse was actually developed as a way to try and get around or rather prevent some of the abuse potential of Adderall and Other Drugs that contain damphetamine D amphetamine stands for dextra amphetamine and in the 70s and 80s there were a fair amount of movies and there was a lot of trafficking and there was a lot of criminal activity related to what was called dexedrine dexedrine is pure D amphetamine so if we're going to be very direct if I were going to just frame these things in the context of their neurochemistry what I can tell you is that vivance is time release dexedrine it's not time release Adderall now just because there were movies and reports of criminal activity related to dexedrine that doesn't necessarily mean that dexedrine is not an effective and useful pharmaceutical in fact vivance which is Time released dexedrine has proved to be very effective in the treatment of ADHD for a lot of people and the reason for that is this time release does indeed prevent abuse in the sense that despite people's many attempts from what I hear to increase the rate of Entry of the damphetamine into their system by either snorting it or you know God forbid even injecting it and things of that sort the attaching of that lysine to damphetamine really does slow the absorption so when somebody takes Vyvanse and hopefully people are taking it responsibly when they take Vyvanse what they're really getting is a slow trickle of damphetamine into their system and therefore a slow long lasting increase in dopamine and norepinephrine and indeed that's what happens the effects of Vyvanse can extend over anywhere from 12 to 16 sometimes even 18 hours depending on how quickly somebody metabolizes it and I should say that there is no way to predict how quickly one will metabolize any of these drugs except by trying them that's one of the sort of downsides of the state of things these days there's no blood test or enzymatic test that will tell you whether or not you're going to be a fast metabolizer or a slow metabolizer and that's why people just have to sort through different dosages which we'll talk about in a little bit they have to sort through different types of sympathomagnetics you know some people try Adderall and they find that you know the quick time course of Adderall or at least quick for them of about six to eight hours is just too fast and then it wears off and they get into a slump in the afternoon other people find that one Adderall taken at six a.m will have them going all day long and into the night and it's just too much stimulation and they need to come way way down in dose or they need to think about other sympathomimetics for ADHD and we'll talk about what some of those other options are a little bit as well so the important thing to understand is that Adderall is really Two drugs DNL amphetamine vivance is D amphetamine which is also called dexedrine but with this time released aspect created by lumping a lysine on there and you may notice that I haven't mentioned one of the major drugs used to treat ADHD and that's ritalin or what sometimes also called Concerta depending on again the time release forms Etc Ritalin was very commonly prescribed for the treatment of ADHD early in the days of using sympathomimetics in order to treat ADHD so for instance I went to college in the early 90s so I started college in 93 and I graduated in 98. it was one year in there as a let's call it a transition year I can recall hearing that Ritalin was being prescribed for ADHD in kids and I like many other people were wondering what are the long-term consequences of this going to be I also like many other people was very perplexed as to why a stimulant sympathomimetic like Ritalin was being prescribed for hyperactive kids that will become clear in a moment but we don't hear so much about Ritalin nowadays and I think that's because Adderall and Vyvanse and things like them have become so popular for the treatment of ADHD it's worth noting that Ritalin is not actually amphetamine Ritalin is what's called methylphenidate and methylphenidate Works in a lot of ways that are similar to the way that Adderall and Vyvanse work but there are certain ways in which it's different now Ritalin methylphenidate does increase dopamine transmission at synapses and it does so also by inhibiting the function of that presynaptic dopamine transporter that would otherwise suck more dopamine back up into the presynaptic cell methylphenidate Ritalin also disrupts the activity of the noradrenergic transporter leading to net increases in the amount of norepinephrine at the synapse but it is not as much a potent inhibitor of the noradrenergic transporter and therefore most of the effect of methylphenidate is to increase dopamine at synapses a lot of people don't realize this a lot of people think that Ritalin is just very short-acting Adderall and that's not the case it is true that Ritalin at least in its standard form tends to have a pretty short half-life and therefore its effects basically kick in about 20 to 40 minutes after taking it sometimes a little bit sooner sometimes a little later and they last about four to six hours as opposed to the six to eight hours typical of Adderall but Ritalin is not short-acting Adderall Ritalin is mainly increasing dopamine and to some extent norepinephrine at synapses whereas Adderall and vivance are increasing both dopamine and norepinephrine to a much greater extent and for those of you that are interested in the underlying cell biological reason for that it has something to do with ritalin's relatively lower affinity for the neuroadrenergic transporter but it's also because remember I listed off three mechanisms by which Adderall and by extension Vyvanse increased dopamine and norepinephrine transmission right disruption the transporter disruption of the vmat2 as well as a disruption of the whole kind of complex of communication between those proteins well Ritalin is really only tapping into the Drug's ability to disrupt the dopamine and noradrenergic transporter so it's three mechanisms of increasing dopamine and norepinephrine for Adderall and Vyvanse and by extension dexedrine and it's only one mechanism for Ritalin to increase dopamine and norepinephrine and therein mostly dopamine so if we take a step back for a moment from all these drugs and all this cell biology of neurons and so forth and we go back to the brain networks involved in attention remember the orchestra model or the teacher model where the prefrontal cortex really sits in top seat in terms of coordinating the actions both the quieting and the yes please speak actions of the brain really bringing about what we think of as focused attention and task switching all the stuff that goes along with learning and focus and cognition well what we know is that dopamine and norepinephrine which are differentially increased by these different drugs that we've been talking about also differentially impact the various aspects of executive function of the prefrontal cortex increasing our attention for specific things and while there is a lot of nuance in the literature about this we can safely say a couple of things first of all increasing dopamine at particular synapses and networks in the brain can serve as what's called noise reduction it can help further enhance the quieting of all that background stuff that background stuff can be attention to things in your environment like noises or visual cues it could be some internal narrative that you had about yesterday or something that somebody said about you or something that somebody you like would like to say about you or whatever it might be that's happening in your head that's distracting you as well as your representation of your internal bodily State what we call interoception this is a really important aspect of attention that we don't often hear about which is that we have the ability to attend to things outside of us which is called exteroception as well as an ability to attend to things inside of us which include things like thoughts but also includes you know for instance how empty or full our gut feels whether or not we're comfortable in our chair you know when we think about the practice of focus and learning or focusing as a verb it involves often forcing ourselves to sit still it often involves us suppressing the fact that our foot is a little bit cramped or that we might need to use the restroom for you know we might want to delay that for 10-15 minutes even though it might be fairly urgent all these sorts of things are Central to our ability to attend and focus and so dopamine while it does many different things in the brain many many different things one of its main functions in the context of all this prefrontal cortex and attention stuff is to quiet the amount of noise that is it helps the prefrontal cortex suppress the signals that would otherwise distract us into thinking about oh yeah I'm kind of thirsty right now or I need to use the restroom or I really want to make this caller I really really want to pick up my phone all of that stuff all of that suppression that shh that quieting down of all the background chatter related to things external and internal to us in our head and our body is greatly facilitated by having more dopamine present in the synapses that allow for what we call noise reduction now in parallel to that is norepinephrine norepinephrine is released from multiple sites in the brain and body but within the brain there's one major site of neurons that manufacture norepinephrine and the name of that site is Locus ceruleus it sits in the back of the brain it's actually a relatively small collection of neurons but they are very very powerful they extend their little axons their wires to multiple locations in the brain and they release norepinephrine at those locations so think of them sort of as a sprinkler system that originates from one very focal location but that can sprinkle norepinephrine at multiple locations in the brain and the amazing thing about Locus ceruleus and that sprinkler system is that indeed the sprinkler system can be pretty widespread where everywhere there's a sprinkler head somebody's getting norepinephrine but it also can fairly focally release norepinephrine at particular sites so while in the context of today's discussion dopamine is acting largely to impart noise reduction norepinephrine has the ability to boost signals at synapses to increase the amplitude and frequency of communication between neurons and in that way in the context of today's discussion norepinephrine when released at the particular synapses in the particular brain networks that are related to attention and learning is largely serving to increase signal so what we have in the context of a drug like Adderall or vivance or to some extent methylphenidate Ritalin does this as well is an increase in dopamine and neuro epinephrine that is leading to two things both a reduction in noise a quieting of the circuitry that we don't want to hear so much from and an increase in the signal of the networks that we do want to pay attention to and the net effect of that noise reduction and Signal amplification is what the engineers refer to as increased signal to noise and the consequence of that is a heightened subjective sense or ability to decide what we want to focus on sit down or stand there and just focus on it so the way that we've been discussing drugs to treat ADHD and their ability to increase dopamine and norepinephrine and thereby to reduce the amount of noise so to speak in the brain and to increase the amount of signal related to things that we want to attend to all presumes that the amount of dopamine and the amount of norepinephrine that's being increased is perfect for what we want to accomplish which is increased focus and reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity but of course in the real world that's not always the case depending on the dosage of the drug one sensitivity to the drug even what stage of development across the lifespan a person is at things can really go Haywire pretty fast and what I'm referring to when I say Haywire is if you think about dopamine and its ability to reduce noise well dopamine does a bunch of other things as well and in fact we know that if dopamine is increased too much in the brain somebody that has ADHD or somebody that doesn't have ADHD people can become euphoric people can become manic people can even become psychotic likewise if norepinephrine is increased too much people won't just become alert they will become very anxious have panic attacks and depending on the drug they're taking they may even experience very serious peripheral symptoms meaning elevated heart rate and sweating that is super uncomfortable and on and on so everything I've been discussing up until now is true but I want to make it clear that it's true in the context of appropriately dosed prescribed drug for a given condition which leads us to the next question which is why would it be that giving these drugs which are in fact stimulants why would that calm a kid down why would that common adult with ADHD down and the answer to that is not completely straightforward and it is worth pointing out that not everyone with ADHD has impulsivity and hyperactivity and therefore an inability to focus some kids and adults with ADHD do have challenges with impulsivity and hyperactivity some do not some just have challenges with focus and I did an entire episode about ADHD and we are going to have an expert guest on this podcast who specializes in the treatment of ADHD to talk about some of these issues further but I just want to remind everybody that as in the general population children and adults with ADHD are capable of very concentrated periods of focus the pattern however tends to be that children and adults with ADHD have a harder time getting into that state of focus and perhaps most importantly they have a very hard time getting into a forced state of focus for things that they don't enjoy doing I'm sure many of you are also thinking wait I don't like to do certain things and it's harder to focus on those things than on the things I like of course does that mean I have ADHD and the answer is not necessarily so kids and adults with ADHD exhibit an extreme variation in their ability to focus such that if there's something they really really like doing they can indeed Focus however for many many other activities that are required in order to develop I guess we'll just call it normal life advancement so sitting still listening to conversations that we may not be particularly interested in that's where the challenges come about so the point is that these brain networks and these neuromodulators like dopamine and norepinephrine that we've been talking about in Fairly straightforward terms as it relates to a Drug's ability to increase their transmission and therefore an improved ability of focus presumes two things it presumes that the dosing is right that is that the levels of increases in these neuromodulators is just right and I also just want to acknowledge that ADHD is first of all not an inability to focus at all it is immense challenges in focusing on lots of different things as required for normal life progression and it's also the case that there is no one specific pattern of ADHD that applies to everyone with ADHD some people both kids and adults will exhibit the hyperactivity but not the impulsivity although those two things tend to go hand in hand some people will have a challenge in focus without hyperactivity impulsivity and so forth and all this just really speaks to the complexity of ADHD and yet and yet we can confidently say that there are more drugs to treat ADHD than any other psychiatric condition we've talked about a few of those now but among those Adderall vivance Ritalin also called methylphenol State there are time release versions there are different variations on those time release versions there's even straight dexedrine which is prescribed for ADHD in some cases and on and on and you might also find it interesting to know that that very large kit of drugs all of which at least the ones we've talked about so far are sympathome addicts or stimulants are more effective at treating ADHD than are any other collection of drugs for treating other psychiatric disorders so what all of that diversity of symptomology and ADHD as well as differences in sensitivity to drugs and individual variation what all of that speaks to is that the large kit of drugs that's out there is designed to be assessed with the careful consult of a very qualified psychiatrist in order to allow the child or adult to arrive at the specific drug and the specific dosage that's ideal for their particular pattern of ADHD and that issue actually gives rise to the answer to that now somewhat age-old question as to why giving stimulants to a kid that is hyperactive would calm them down and the answer is that the hyperactivity impulsivity and focus issues present in ADHD in children and adults are the consequence not necessarily of deficient activity of neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex or deficient activity of the default mode Network or deficient activity of the salience network Etc what appears to be the case based on a lot of high quality neuroimaging data is that the brains of children and adults with ADHD have all of these networks functioning but those networks are actually hyper connected that is they tend to be co-active at times when ordinarily meaning kids and adults without ADHD they would not be co-active so that's an important point because it's easy to get the impression that ADHD is just a deficiency in dopamine and norepinephrine and that's simply not the case if you recall dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators they modulate the activity of other neural circuits and they can both increase and decrease activity within those circuits so you don't necessarily want to think about dopamine and norepinephrine just as molecules that increase neural activity and you certainly don't want to think about ADHD it's just a deficiency in dopamine or deficiency in norepinephrine the way these drugs work when they are used effectively to treat ADHD is to tune the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine that are present in particular brain networks in order to allow the person to arrive at just the right balance between the activation of these different neural circuits causing them largely to be less synchronous in their firing so this takes us back to this question why giving stimulants to a kid would calm them down it's not so much that you're giving a stimulant to a kid to place them into a state of calm I think that's a common misconception rather by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine these drugs yes increase levels of overall autonomic arousal they are after all sympathomimetics but more importantly to the treatment of ADHD symptoms you are activating the prefrontal cortex in a way that allows it to be more of a coordinator of that Orchestra conductor or if you prefer the analogy to a teacher in the classroom to ramp up the activity of certain neural circuits in a given moment and quiet down the activity of other neural circuits such that the default mode Network can still perform its incredible actions after all the default mode network is involved not just in self-referencing and kind of daydreaming but also creativity and Imagination that's been well described in the literature as well as the salience network and these other networks that are designed to drop us into very narrow trenches of attention these drugs for the treatment of ADHD are are indeed stimulants but the goal of prescribing these drugs to a child or adult with ADHD is to adjust dosage timing and the duration over which somebody takes it in their lifespan in order to allow those neural circuits to work in the proper way meaning for the conductor to activate the instruments in that little symphony or band in the appropriate order in order to arrive at the right music as opposed to all the instruments playing at once which would just be complete noise or if again if you prefer the classroom teaching analogy for the teacher to call on one student while the others are quiet and then to call on a different student have one student return to their seats to have the students work in small groups again all of this by analogy the point being that dopamine and norepinephrine are all allowing these networks to be activated to the precisely correct levels and in the precisely correct sequence now the other key aspect of drugs like Adderall Vyvanse Ritalin and similar to tree ADHD has everything to do with these neuromodulators dopamine and norepinephrine but it has to do with their other incredible feature besides just their ability to reduce noise and increase signal Within These brain networks and that incredibly important feature is what we call neuroplasticity or the brain and nervous system's ability to change in response to experience I've done entire episodes of The huberman Lab podcast on neuroplasticity what it is and how to access it at different stages of development and in adulthood by the way you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com by simply searching plasticity in the search function but the important thing to understand about plasticity in the context of today's discussion is that while there are many different ways to induce neuroplasticity almost all of them almost all of them involve strongly activating certain brain Networks and in that case also strong or elevated release of certain neuromodulators now we've talked about dopamine and norepinephrine they are but two of many neuromodulators others include serotonin acetylcholine and each of the neuromodulators does different things that different synapses in the brain and there's some Global statements that can be made about each of them we've made some of those earlier like dopamine is broadly involved in motivation craving and pursuit and norepinephrine and Signal detection and drawing of focus or salience to something in our environment or in our body or inner experience serotonin does other things acetylcholine does other things but what's really important to understand is that any time there is a dramatic elevation in dopamine and norepinephrine relative to Baseline relative to what was happening with dopamine and norepinephrine just prior to that that has a tendency to promote neuroplasticity at particular synapses so here is where it's appropriate to remind everybody that neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters neurotransmitters are chemicals that just like dopamine and norepinephrine are released between neurons and they are what actually contribute to the electrical signals going up or down between different neurons and again dopamine and norepinephrine modulate that activity causing a given amount of neurotransmitter to have an even greater effect for instance so when we hear about dopamine and norepinephrine and we hear about motivation or Focus Etc that's all fine and good but it's also important to remember that when dopamine and norepinephrine are increased there is a higher probability of strengthening connections where dopamine and norepinephrine are increased and what that means is that later even if levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are not increased if they go back to Baseline it's often the case that if in our prior history or the history of a given set of neurons in our brain there was more dopamine or norepinephrine around it's very likely that the connections where that took place are strengthened and therefore more easily activated and this takes us back to the really original purpose of prescribing the sympathomimetic stimulants to children with ADHD during development it was yes designed to try and help them Focus to reduce their hyperactivity and help them Focus but it was also designed to help the brain networks that are responsible for Focus to undergo neuroplasticity that is for the synapses involved to strengthen so that those networks could function more efficiently later on even after cessation of the drug this is an absolutely crucial point that I think is not often discussed when people for instance say should I put my kid on ADHD meds or should I take my kid off of ADHD meds as they transition from adolescence to their later teen years and into college I mean after all no child or a parent or adult for that matter wants to achieve a bunch of benefits with a drug and then lose those benefits later nor does any parent or child want to take a drug that they don't need to take when they could access other routes to improving the neural circuitry or the function of some health system in the body because I don't think anyone really wants to medicate their kids unless they have to I would hope not and I don't think any kid wants to be medicated unless they absolutely need to be medicated so increasing dopamine and norepinephrine with these drugs like Adderall Vyvanse Ritalin and similar is causing several things and some of those things actually provide some general answers as to whether or not parents should put their kids on these compounds in the first place obviously they're going to do that in the under the careful consult of a qualified psychiatrist I would hope and only under those circumstances but also whether or not the child should stay on those drugs over time and here's what we do know for sure I did a vast search within the literature in order to arrive at what is very clear which is that children with ADHD true ADHD who are diagnosed with ADHD and are treated with appropriate doses of drugs like Adderall ritalin or Vyvanse they're far better both in childhood and later in life when it comes to Performance in school performance in terms of focusing on anything and in terms of General outcomes so for instance a lot of people have wondered and worried about whether or not treatment with these drugs early in life will set up a predisposition for illicit drug abuse or craving an addictive potential later and it is very clear from the studies that have emerged over the last really 15 years but mainly within the last five years that's when most of the data have arrived that children with ADHD who are not treated correctly both with drugs and behavioral treatments because really the combination of drugs and behavioral treatments is the optimal situation so kids with ADHD who are not treated with drugs and behavioral treatments to deal with their ADHD have a much higher tendency towards illicit drug use and addictive drug potential in their adulthood okay so there is a real danger to not treating ADHD during childhood and the reverse is also true which is that children with ADHD who take prescription drugs that are sympathomimetics so yes as you've heard they are speed amphetamine is speed although I should say if they take Methylphenidate ritalin or Concerta or something of that sort that's not amphetamine nonetheless it's a stimulant it's a sympathometic also these are kids that are taking these drugs during development and therefore levels of dopamine levels of norepinephrine are being increased in their brain and body and you might say well wouldn't that lead to a craving for these things later in life and that does not appear to be the case in fact there's some very nice neuroimaging studies mainly positron emission tomography studies that I'll provide a link to in the show note captions that show the early treatment with these drugs actually leads to combinations of increased dopamine Transmission in the forebrain later in life at a lower level or a lower threshold I should say in a way that essentially says there's normalization of the circuits Across Time by the application of these drugs early in life again in the case of children that have diagnosed ADHD I in no way shape or form want to imply that all children should be treated with these drugs is quite clearly not going to be a good idea so all of this really speaks to the critical importance of getting an accurate diagnosis of ADHD you know diagnostic criteria include many things in children there are multiple there are more than nine diagnostic criteria for each of the categories relating to impulsivity hyperactivity and so on so a well-qualified psychiatrist will do several things they will first of all do a careful diagnostic evaluation of a child and in addition one would hope that they would think about prescribing both appropriate pharmacologic treatments for ADHD but also be aware of and prescribe the various other types of prescriptions meaning behavioral prescriptions so there are clearly certain learning tools and things that kids can do in order to improve their ability to focus and to be less impulsive that combine especially well with drug treatments as well as new advancements in the realm of nutrition and supplementation that are constantly coming online and the best psychiatrists are going to be tuned into all of those aspects of treatment for ADHD not just prescription drugs but also behavioral treatments also nutritional guidelines also supplementation and also updating each and all of those things as a child matures from each stage of development to the next I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be assessed with a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information about what to do with all all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc and then to assess what sorts of Behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes three new hormone markers that are critical to measure during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years these are estradiol progesterone and thyroid stimulating hormone if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off now the other common question is if a child has been treated with these ADHD meds during development do they need to continue on those drugs indefinitely and the short answer to this is it depends and that can be a somewhat frustrating answer I realize but the good news is it's something that can be assessed in a fairly straightforward way let's recall that the use of these drugs to treat ADHD is designed to accomplish two things it's designed to improve the function of those neural circuits that allow a child to focus and it's also designed to increase the strength of those circuits to effectively teach the circuits how to learn what focus is in other words these drugs are designed in some cases to be used and then withdrawn later because the circuits that they helped build up are functioning well in some cases however the circuits that underlie Focus are not going to be able to function at the level required for normal healthy life progression unless there's continued application of the drug so how would this work in the real world context well I think any child or adolescent or person younger than 25 that's taken these drugs has no doubt achieved some level of neuroplasticity of the neural circuits related to all the things we call Focus I and I want to be very clear there's no single brain area or set of brain circuits for what I'm referring to as Focus because after all Focus involves test switching Focus involves all sorts of different cognitive operations depending on what we're focusing on right the focusing on a sport is basically a practice of directing one's attention in different locations at different moments focusing on studying is an entirely different pattern of focus altogether but the point being if a person 25 years or younger takes a drug that increases dopamine and norepinephrine and assuming that things are working meaning the dose is right they're achieving better ability to focus etc those circuits are going to get stronger and it seems entirely reasonable in fact it was supported by the psychiatrist that I spoke to prior to this episode that people who've been on ADHD meds for any point of time prior to 25 talk to their psychiatrist about what tapering off those drugs in order to examine whether or not they still need those drugs would look like now I mentioned the word taper because there is a withdrawal potential of Simply stopping these drugs very quickly because they do ramp up dopamine and norepinephrine even though they increase plasticity of the neural circuits for focus and mood and motivation if one very abruptly ceases taking any of these drugs it does not feel good that drop in dopamine that one inevitably experiences is almost always associated with lethargy with depressed mood with feeling not good in a number of ways and of course challenges in Focus so anytime one is going to go off one of these drugs or sample what it is to even reduce dosage that has to be done in close communication with a board-certified psychiatrist at the same time it was made very clear to me from ADHD expert psychiatrists that reductions in dosage over time often are optimal for a patient okay and this gets to the whole issue of dosage generally you know I spend a good amount of time talking to somebody who prescribes these drugs both to children and adults about dosage ranges and I don't want to spend too much time on this from the perspective of how much one should take in fact I don't want anyone to think that what I'm about to say should dictate what they should take specifically because that's something that really has to be worked out on an individual basis but it is worth noting that if you look at the studies on Adderall and Methylphenidate but you'll see it is a pretty broad range in those studies and that's because some of the studies used people that were already taking these drugs and asked them to participate in neuroimaging studies other studies actually put people on these drugs for the very first time or adjusted their dosage and so you'll see a tremendous range of drug doses explored for instance you will see anywhere from 10 to 40 milligrams of Adderall per day you'll see anywhere from 10 to 60 milligrams of Ritalin per day and here we could easily be talking about studies on children or adults with respect to Vyvanse you'll see that the dosages tend to be much higher in part that's because vivance has if you recall it's that lysine which is a big molecule stuck on D amphetamine which is a smaller molecule and so the dosages of Vyvanse tend to be in the hundreds of milligram ranges but most of that 100 milligrams of Vyvanse is not going to be the damphetamine it's going to be the lysine which doesn't do anything in the context of treating the brain it's just there to control the slow release so it's thought that 100 milligrams of Vyvanse translates to roughly nine milligrams of Adderall and on and on and actually it's pretty hard to translate between dosages of different drugs in any direct way and in speaking with a psychiatrist expert in ADHD in preparation for this episode he made very clear that it is extremely extremely difficult to predict how a child or adult will react to a given dosage of any of these drugs so much so in fact that he anecdotally reported to me that one of his patients is a male 3 100 pounds diagnosed with ADHD and who achieves tremendous relief from just 2.5 milligrams of Adderall per day and at the same time he has two patients both of whom are sisters so they're genetically related who are in the 120 to 140 pound range who did not respond well at all for the treatment of their ADHD until their dosages were very very high and if I tell you these dosages I just want to warn you in advance I'm not suggesting anyone explore these dosages without of course the approval of their psychiatrist turns out that neither of these two young women responded at all to ADHD medication until they achieved dosages in the range of 180 in the case of one sister and 240 milligrams in the case of the other sister per day which is an astronomically high dose on the face of it but this physician again board certified physician expert in adiation verified for me that indeed neither of them experience any discomfort or side effects that led them to not want to take the drug but of course that amount of Adderall could send somebody else into an absolute psychotic fit could potentially even cause cardiac arrest I mean it's remarkable the ranges of Adderall that are used effectively in children and adults and this is true for a lot of the other sympathomimetics used to treat ADHD and of course a good psychiatrist will always assess dosage as it relates to positive benefits you know relief of symptoms so relief of impulsivity relief of hyperactivity improvements and ability to focus and of course they they are going to consider side effects any uncomfortable adverse effects that come from taking the drug at a given dosage or taking the drug at all now of course this all begs the question of why such tremendous variation is this due to genetic differences in the amount of dopamine or norepinephrine that people make it appears that the major underlying factor for why people require such vastly different dosages of these sympathomimetics for the relief of ADHD has to do with the different enzymes or levels of enzymes that people make which metabolize these drugs both in the brain and body and unfortunately there is no simple blood test or saliva test or test of any kind that can predict how someone will respond to these drugs so the most logical and safe way to assess dosage is to start with the lowest possible effective dose and to increase only as necessary in order to achieve the positive benefits while of course paying attention to any side effects that might arise a question that comes up from time to time when discussing the long-term effects of drugs like Adderall Ritalin and vivance is whether or not they can negatively impact height or growth or development in some other way this is a logical question to ask because after all these drugs are effectively mimicking stress in the body and most everyone is heard by now that while stress can help us in the short term it helps us deploy immune molecules to protect us against infection and it sharpens our visual focus and our ability to respond to things for survival chronically elevating our stress over long periods of time we know reduces the effectiveness of our immune system and can actually cause certain forms of brain degeneration and while there aren't a lot of longitudinal studies on the heights of kids with ADHD and of course we never can tell how tall someone would have grown to be if they were treated with a drug because we don't have a perfect control experiment even in the case of identical twin experiments and therein there aren't that many of those examples where one twin was treated for ADHD and the other wasn't Etc but here's what we know it does not appear that treatment with sympathomimetics during development provided that dosages are kept in the appropriate ranges is going to limit overall height in fact if you look at the data it appears that children with ADHD who are treated with ADHD meds actually arrive at slightly higher bmis body mass indexes compared to age-matched peers now of course body mass index doesn't necessarily correlate with height right someone could not achieve a full height but could be heavier either through bone or fat or muscle or combination of all three but what we know is that the appropriate use of ADHD meds during development is not stunting development in any kind of overall way it's not preventing maturation of the body in ways that are leading to reduced weight or somehow impaired growth overall with that said long-term elevations of sympathetic nervous system activity does carry some risk and one of the primary risks that people have wondered about is cardiovascular risk this makes perfect sense right when you increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system you increase blood pressure to increase heart rate you increase in some cases peripheral sweating you know all the things that we associate with stress so you can imagine that a child or adult with ADHD that takes these sympathomimetics every day even if the dosage is kept in a Range that doesn't allow them to experience any immediate untoward side effects so they're not feeling miserable they're just feeling like they can focus better but one always wonders what's going on under the hood so to speak there is as far as I know one major study that's addressed this and the conclusions of that study were a little bit hard to put into a single category it did point to a subtle increase in cardiovascular risk but the results did not point to anything so dramatic that the authors of the study warned against taking these drugs or encouraging people to cease taking these drugs again provided they're being prescribed by a board-certified physician for ADHD and at the appropriate dosage for that person that said I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage and it stands to reason that if you're somebody who's taking ADHD meds or if your child is taking ADHD meds that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try and improve cardiovascular health or at least not put it at additional risk so those are going to be the obvious things like avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine regular exercise is going to be encouraged and things of that sort and that dovetails into a bunch of other questions that are often asked anytime the topic of Adderall or Ritalin comes up which is what about alcohol you know is drinking alcohol the same time or at different times even going to be problematic if one is taking these drugs is taking benzodiazepines going to be a problem etc etc there's a very straightforward answer to this which is it's very clear that alcohol certainly in children but also in adults is best not consumed I did an entire episode about alcohol which got into this and the data for this if you've heard that having some alcohol in particular red wine is better for you than know alcohol that is simply not true sorry it's not true most adults who are not alcoholics can probably have up to two that's right two drinks per week and still be on the safe side of Health although zero is better than two and once you get past two you start seeing effects on various systems including increased cancer risk especially brain neuron loss and degeneration risk I covered all of those data in the episode on alcohol that you can find at hubermanlab.com combining alcohol with sympathomimetics even though they reside in very different Pathways within the brain in fact the sympathomimetics are driving up sympathetic nervous system activity whereas alcohol is actually doing the opposite it's depressing it and yet all the data points to the fact that combining alcohol with sympathomimetics such as Vyvanse Adderall ritalin or any kind of amphetamine is going to be more detrimental to the brain and body than simply taking those drugs on their own put differently and more directly if you are taking any of the drugs that we've been talking about to treat ADHD or if you just happen to be taking them for whatever reason you are going to want to avoid drinking alcohol at any time and you're going to want to avoid benzodiazepines and similar unless they've been prescribed to you by your physician in advance of this episode I put a call out on social media for questions about Adderall Etc and I got a lot of questions about whether or not their impacts of these drugs on the hormone systems of the body and if they impact the reproductive system in particular I also got questions about whether or not these drugs impact sexual behavior or libido or anything of that sort in reviewing the literature what I can tell you is that there are very few studies unfortunately of the long-term effects of these drugs on the endocrine or hormone systems of the body but we do know a few things for sure first of all when you increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system for long periods of time you are very likely increasing levels of cortisol cortisol is a quote unquote stress hormone but cortisol also plays some really important positive roles in your body in fact if you want cortisol released especially early in the day you don't want cortisol released so much late in the day this actually relates back to timing and schedules of taking drugs this is something again that needs to be worked out with your psychiatrist or your child's psychiatrist but one of the reasons why there are so many different drugs for the treatment of ADHD is that each and all of them has a different time course of action so Ritalin is very short-lived which might sound bad because then you have to take it multiple times throughout the day but if you think about from the perspective of sleep and the importance of having low cortisol at night and these drugs increase cortisol and the importance of getting sleep because after all sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance in kids and adults it's responsible for growth it's when neuroplasticity happens it's just so vitally important a lot of the drugs that we've been talking about can severely limit one's ability to fall and stay asleep and so a short-acting drug like Ritalin is actually attractive from the perspective of being able to take it in the morning and still get to sleep at night or taking it in the morning and in the afternoon and maybe even again in the evening depending on the person and then still being able to fall asleep at night whereas long duration release of D amphetamine which is what you get when you take Vyvanse for some people is going to inhibit their sleep they'll get a nice steady rise and Improvement in focus and reduction in hyperactivity but they might have a lot of trouble falling asleep at night and Adderall having a somewhat intermediate time course of action between ritalin which is short-lived and Vyvanse which is very long-lived perhaps is going to be the best solution for somebody else where they can take it early in the day perhaps at a low dose maybe again later in the day low dose and then still fall asleep at night but I've spoken to people and I've spoke to this clinician expert in ADHD who told me that some people will take as little as 2.5 milligrams of Adderall at 6 00 am and have a hard time falling asleep later that night at 11 PM so again vastly different sensitivities to these drugs leading to vastly different requirements of dosage and timing of intake and which particular drug somebody might choose to or choose not to take so how does that relate to hormones and sex and reproduction well cortisol itself is a hormone it can act as a bit of a hormone and a neurotransmitter in the brain but for the most part it's acting as a hormone in the brain and body and it does a number of things first of all it can enhance your levels of focus and alertness it can activate your immune system I know that immunologists out there just cringe when I say activate the immune system your immune system is always doing various things so it's always active just as your nervous system is always active but it can to be specific it can amplify or mobilize the release of anti-inflammatory molecules in your brain and body to combat different types of bacterial viral and fungal infections it's doing an enormous number of positive things it's also involved in setting mood it has interactions with thyroid hormone pathways I've done entire episodes about cortisol and cortisol regulation to paint all of that with a very broad brush and briefly now it's advantageous to have your cortisol release high in the early part of the day and to taper off toward the end of the day in fact late day elevations in cortisol are a strong correlate of depressive symptoms this was demonstrated by my colleagues David Spiegel and Robert sapolsky at Stanford School of Medicine but that is not to say that cortisol is bad it's to say that the timing of cortisol release is key so do these sympathomimetic drugs disrupt the endocrine system well they can if you are very awake and very alert regardless of whether or not you're taking your sympathomimetic treatment for ADHD early in the day or late in the day you are very likely experiencing elevations in cortisol late in the day so it is important even for those of you that like to study and need to focus in the evening and nighttime hours that you try and limit your levels of overall alertness and certainly stress late in the day because doing that day after day after day for several weeks or months or years can indeed disrupt other hormones in the endocrine system and again that's because cortisol is interacting with thyroid hormone and testosterone and estrogen in fact cortisol in many ways competes with or can out-compete for the production of testosterone and other so-called steroid hormones remember cortisol itself is a corticosteroid hormone so when we hear the word steroids oftentimes people just think about athletes and steroid abuse in sports but steroid hormones includes a lot of different types of hormones which are good for us our endogenous steroid hormones are vital for all sorts of things Vitality reproduction Etc and the way this works in general terms is that the cholesterol molecule is used to create testosterone and cortisol and estrogen if we make too much cortisol we in many ways are reducing the total amount of testosterone that we make or that is active it's not exactly that straightforward but we can make that statement with uh with confidence for instance if you spike your cortisol just briefly during the day because you have some sort of stressful event that's not going to inhibit your testosterone in fact it probably is going to boost your testosterone levels somewhat however if your cortisol levels are chronically elevated yes indeed it's likely that you're going to suppress your total and or free Unbound forms of testosterone and downstream to that you will experience effects such as reductions in libido reductions in muscle and bone mass reductions in all sorts of aspects of testosterone related psychology and bodily biology this is true for both males and females and the same thing could be said for estrogen now what's impossible for us to say is whether or not taking a given treatment for ADHD is going to for instance prevent a woman from ovulating that could happen through chronic elevations and cortisol but there's no direct link meaning there are no studies at least that I'm aware of showing that people that take Adderall have irregular ovulatory Cycles or that they cease menstruating entirely I don't think there's any evidence for that whatsoever nor is there any evidence that people that take Adderall or other sympathomimetics for the treatment of ADHD have lower overall testosterone in fact you can imagine all sorts of instances in which the opposite was true that a child or young adult or adult who has ADHD but then goes on these meds to improve their symptoms is now focusing and achieving more in life we know that happiness can impact dopamine and vice versa and testosterone levels and productivity itself and reaching our goals can feedback on the hormone system so anytime there's a discussion about hormones or a study that shows that doing X or not doing why impacts hormone levels of a given type we have to be very careful to make sure that we're talking about causality because all of these hormones are in a very intricate crosstalk with one another we can however make a very general statement which is that when you are in states of stress for long periods of time that is not a favorable condition addition for your immune system your hormone system or frankly any other system in the brain and body so the treatment of ADHD with these drugs should never be done at the expense of these other critical biological systems another common question and concern is whether or not kids and I suppose for that matter adults that take medication for ADHD are basically being predisposed to psychosis and or other forms of addiction and earlier we talked a bit about the risk for addiction and the take-home message there is very clear that kids and adults that are treated for ADHD appropriately so with the appropriate dosage of the appropriate drugs under the supervision of a board-certified qualified psychiatrist or at less risk for forming addictions to other substances in adulthood or other substances generally I think a lot of people also wonder whether or not those kids and those adults that take these ADHD meds become addicted to the medications themselves that's a bit of a tricky issue to resolve anytime one stops taking a drug or even tapers off a drug that's used to treat something where they feel better on the drug they're going to experience two sets of effects and these two sets of effects are often confounded with one another one is the withdrawal effects so the effects of removing the drug that makes somebody feel less good than Baseline so for instance a kid that takes ADHD meds until their late teens or early 20s decides they're going to taper off they do that and they're feeling lousy during the taper or when they reduce their dosage to zero they're you know foggy brain they can't focus they feel a little bit depressed mood it unclear whether or not those are withdrawal symptoms or whether or not those are the consequence of not having the systems in their brain activated the way that those systems were activated before I realize that for some of you that might seem like the same thing but that's not necessarily the same thing and probably the best analogy would be something along the lines of a hangover right if somebody drinks too much on a given night the next morning they have a hangover The Hangover makes them feel lousy it's it is actually a withdrawal from alcohol effect but then when they recover from The Hangover they realize that their sober State feels pretty good it doesn't obviously feel the same as being on alcohol but that sober state is not a state of withdrawal okay if we were to look at removal or tapering off of ADHD meds there's going to be a period of withdrawal symptoms but then the real question is how does somebody feel after they get through those withdrawal symptoms so that's an important issue to highlight now in terms of psychosis this is a very interesting and very important literature sure first of all any amphetamine whether or not it's D amphetamine L amphetamine and also methylphenidate for that matter Ritalin can induce psychosis now there are a number of different factors that are going to predispose somebody to psychosis having a first relative who's had psychotic episodes either schizophrenic episodes or bipolar episodes is certainly a strong predisposition of course if an individual themselves have had psychotic episodes that's the strongest predisposition that one could imagine so having a first relative with schizophrenia or with bipolar depression or sometimes called bipolar disorder sometimes it's also just called bipolar these days is going to be a strong predisposition for psychotic episodes made much greater anytime one takes a sympathomimetic drug such as amphetamine but also methylphenidate Ritalin is going to increase that likelihood of psychotic episodes then comes the question of if somebody has a psychotic episode as the consequence of taking any of these drugs whether or not it's been prescribed for ADHD or not will those psychotic symptoms go away after the person stops taking the drug there appears to be a divide in the literature or rather a divide according to drug such that people that take Ritalin methylphenidate and have a psychotic episode often not always but most often if they stop taking methylphenidate The Psychotic episode will cease not always the case but most often times it will cease whereas in individuals who have a predisposition to psychosis or even if they're not aware of a predisposition of psychosis and they take Adderall which as you recall is a combination of D and L amphetamine they can have psychotic episodes that sometimes are very long lasting even after the cessation of the drug and while that might sound kind of shocking and really scary and indeed it is scary it perhaps shouldn't shock us that much because if you recall D amphetamine which there's a lot of in Adderall it's a very potent way of increasing dopamine and anytime you potently increase dopamine in a person who has a predisposition to psychotic episodes you are shifting the whole system toward a greater propensity for psychosis this would also be the appropriate time to talk about meth methamphetamine again methamphetamine is considered an illicit drug a drug of abuse it is responsible for a lot of The Misfortune and tragedy that you see on the streets of major cities and even outside of major cities and rural areas it has all sorts of negative effects on health including oral health cardiovascular health it is neurotoxic to serotonergic neuron so it kills serotonin neurons that is absolutely clear it kills dopaminergic neurons that is absolutely clear one of the ways that methamphetamine creates so many of the problems that it does eating effects on the body abuse potential addictive potential the fact that methamphetamine can spark psychosis in those that have a predisposition to psychosis but also that it can create psychosis in individuals who have no predisposition to psychosis right all of this points to methamphetamine just being a terrible drug all around and yet if you recall back to the beginning of the episode there is one form of prescription methamphetamine but its uses are extremely narrow and it's probably best left out of this conversation because its uses are so so narrow in the clinical sense I managed to talk to One expert this is a board-certified psychiatrist who's expert in ADHD who is also very familiar with the psychosis symptoms induced by methamphetamine and by various ADHD drugs and people who have the predisposition they made it very clear that any of the sympathom and medic ADHD drugs that are of the amphetamine variety so that would be Adderall and extended release Adderall it'll be Pure dexedrine or any variants that include amphetamine are going to have higher likelihood of inducing psychosis and people that have a predisposition of psychosis and yet they did assure me that at appropriately prescribed and safe dosages that the total incidence of psychosis in people that take those drugs is still fairly low and not that much greater than in the general population although there is an increased risk it's not that severe and they also highlighted the fact that methylphenidate Ritalin carries a lower potential for inducing psychosis not zero but a lower level of inducing psychosis then for the amphetamine type sympathomimetics now one exception is a Vyvanse that long release damphetamine that we talked about earlier there does seem to be some things protective about that long duration release of damphetamine that occurs with Vyvanse which is not to say that there's zero abuse or addictive potential with Vyvanse um I was told by the same individual that indeed they've had knowledge of patients trying to increase the rate of absorption of Vyvanse and release of Vyvanse or technically of the damphetamine in order to get more of a high from Vyvanse as opposed to just the extended release but they did assure me however that Vivant seems to be associated with fewer psychotic episodes and less abuse and addictive potential overall which again is not to say that it's a perfectly safe drug but really this just highlights the fact that the kinetics or the time course of dopamine and norepinephrine release that's caused by a given drug is going to correlate very strongly with its abuse potential and addictive potential and its potential to induce psychotic episodes and this is where the discussion about meth becomes especially relevant one of the reasons why meth is so dangerous in terms of its addictive potential and its potential to induce psychotic episodes is first of all how much dopamine it releases again five times more than any of the other drugs that we've been talking about but also how fat past that Peak comes on it's a very fast onset and that's true whether or not people are snorting it without their taking it orally or especially if they inject it intravenously but meth because it increases dopamine so fast into such a great degree and then the the peak in dopamine comes down very fast as well and it drops below the Baseline levels of dopamine that were present initially that's one of the reasons why methamphetamine is so dangerous in terms of addiction and in terms of psychotic episodes this gets back to a bunch of issues we've talked about before on the huberman Lab podcast about dopamine kinetics and I've done two episodes on dopamine that I'll refer you to one is called dopamine motivation and drive which is all about dopamine and regulating dopamine and the other one is about optimizing dopamine it's more of a toolkit focused episode both those you can find at hubermanlab.com but the general takeaway that's relevant for what we're talking about now is that with dopamine it's not just about the absolute levels of dopamine that are reached but how long lasting those increases in dopamine are so with vivance even though vivance is damphetamine it's fairly potent not as impotent as meth but fairly potent at increasing dopamine and norepinephrine it's a long extended release in dopamine and norepinephrine which reduces its overall abuse potential because it doesn't tend to create that immediate Euphoria and high and then crash below Baseline a lot of you will hear that it increases dopamine a lot and then stays up as translating to okay well then you're just euphoric for 16 hours but that's not the case when it comes to dopamine it's an issue of How High that Peak is and whether or not that Peak is stable or whether or not it comes down again and when it comes to psychotic episodes or addictive potential it seems that any drug or behavior that increases dopamine very quickly and then brings dopamine down very quickly is what sets the high potential for addiction and abuse and for inducing psychotic episodes so that's why I'm talking about these two things in parallel and now it should be very clear why vyvance doesn't have so much addictive and abuse potential and has at least lower potential for inducing psychotic episodes and it should also be clear to you that for people who do not have ADHD as a child or for people that do not have ADHD in adulthood if they were to take any truly any of the compounds that we're talking about thus far methylphenidate Ritalin Adderall vivance dexedrine and certainly methamphetamine what we observe from neuroimaging studies is that these people get enormous increases in dopamine they're not familiar with these drugs so the increases in dopamine are just Cosmic for them they experience a lot of euphoria even if the dosages are low the Euphoria is associated with a very heightened degree of focus they've never really felt before here what I'm talking about is a lot of the recreational and off prescription use of Adderall and things like it and what we know is that that sets in motion both a potential for abuse and addiction to that feeling and substance as well as a higher potential for psycho episodes down the road okay so put differently children who have ADHD and are prescribed any of these drugs or adults who have ADHD and are prescribed any of these drugs who take them for some period of time are actually at lesser risk to all of the issues related to having chronically elevated and greatly elevated dopamine as a kind of first time event or as a rare event whereas anyone who takes these drugs without a prescription and decides okay I want to focus more or I'm going to use this to stay up for a couple of days in other words using it recreationally or using it for quote-unquote performance enhancement is that far greater risk for addiction to these substances because of the amplitude and the time course of dopamine that results when one takes these drugs just out of the blue and so for that reason I really want to caution everybody against using any of the compounds that I've discussed thus far unless it's been prescribed to you by a physician for the specific purpose of ADHD now I'm sure someone out there is screaming from the back wait if a kid takes these drugs because they're prescribed them for ADHD the very first time they take them they're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response or if an adult goes in and talks to their psychiatrist and says you know I'm having issues with focusing in their prescribed one of these meds for ADHD and they take it they're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response isn't that going to set in motion all the same things that somebody who is using these drugs recreationally would have and indeed that's one of the reasons why a lot of psychiatrists will start with a very low dosage or the lowest possible dosage to see how somebody responds to that low dosage and then over time might or might not increase that dosage in fact they might even bring it down further depending on how sensitive somebody is to the drug but equally important is the fact that it is the repeated taking of that drug by the child with ADHD or by the adult with ADHD that actually leads to lesser and lesser peaks in dopamine each time which is not to say that the person becomes entirely desensitized to the effects of the drug but rather that the system equilibrates through what's called homeostatic plasticity sometimes referred to broadly as habituation to a drug but there are systems in the brain and body that regulate the connections between neurons so that if dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated above Baseline levels for a while the system normalizes so that instead the connections between neurons become stronger and there isn't the critical requirement for all that increase in dopamine and norepinephrine I realize that might sound a little bit technical but basically what I'm saying is the response that somebody has to taking a drug for the first time is Far and Away different than the response to a drug that somebody has if they are taking the same drug day after day after day this gets to another issue which is not discussed that often these days but that is really important if you go back to the original clinical literature on the sympathomimetics what you'll find is that the original use of these sympathomimetics to treat childhood ADHD suggested that children not take these drugs every single day now I'm not recommending that kids take drug holidays because I'm not a clinician I'm not promoting any specific dose or dosing regimen but in speaking again to a psychiatrist expert in ADHD who by the way is going to be a guest on this podcast in the not too distant future what he told me was that many of these drugs were designed to be taken during the school week for children with weekends off or during the school year with weekends off but then also with vacations during the summer holidays and that these days rarely if ever is that the pattern of intake that these kids are following and why that is has interesting sociological and financial explanations I'm not alluding to any kind of conspiracy here but this is an aspect of the dosing with these drugs that has sort of Fallen away in recent years but I think is really interesting and it's something that actually was supported for the treatment of adult ADHD as well again there is a very different biological and neuroplastic response to taking a drug once versus taking a drug for say five days and then taking weekends off to taking a drug over and over again every single day for a pattern of years and when exploring the literature and preparation for this episode I confess it was a bit dizzying to find answers to what are the long-term effects of taking Adderall or what are the long-term effects of taking Vyvanse Etc in fact most of the literature on the long-term effects of taking drugs to treat ADHD has focus on methylphenidate on Ritalin there are studies on Vyvanse and adderall and actually those were the studies that I will link in the show note captions primarily because that's where most of the interest is these days the reason why so many of the Studies have focused on methylphenidate on Ritalin is largely because that was one of the first drugs used to treat ADHD so in terms of addressing long-term effects so kids treated with ADHD meds those kids are now adults and therefore can be neuroimaged and assessed whereas a lot of kids that have been prescribed Adderall or Vyvanse or similar have not yet made it to stages of life in which we can answer that question directly there are a few studies and I've made it clear to include those studies in my description of results today in particular the result I talked about earlier where there's an improvement in executive function in kids that have taken ADHD meds or adults that have taken ADHD meds for a longer period of time anywhere from months to years those studies did include both Adderall and Vyvanse and methylphenidate and again I'll link to those studies but by and large most of what we know about the long-term effects of any of these drugs has to do primarily with studies of methylphenidate I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about some compounds that are not considered amphetamines at all but that are now being used to treat ADHD both in children and adults more frequently the major drug in this category of non-amphetamine treatments for ADHD is modafinil which is also called by its commercial name Provigil there's a variance on this which is our modafinil which goes by the brand name Nuvigil the major difference between modafinil and arm modafinil aside from having a slight chemical difference is that modafinil was released first our modafinil is the second in the generation of these drugs and modafinil tends to be very expensive that's one of the reasons why it's prohibitive for some people to take it can be as expensive as 25 a pill or more to more than a thousand dollars per month and our modafinil tends to be far far less expensive I've talked to a couple experts about whether or not there are any genuine differences between these two drugs and they report no although consumers of these drugs for whatever reason whether or not it's Placebo or not report yes there is a different when I say Placebo I in no way mean that these drugs are just acting as Placebo I just mean that you know people tend to get very attached to certain drugs and whether or not the brand name or the generic version works better for them there's all sorts of lore about this in fact there are a lot of people out there who strongly feel that brand name Adderall works better than generic Adderall for them there are a lot of people out there who say the same thing about vivance there are a lot of people out there who say the same thing about Ritalin and all sorts of drugs whether or not that's true or not is unclear it is clear that generic versions of drugs can use binders and other things that are in the pill or capsule that are different than what the brand name pillar capsule uses as binders to hold the drug together and that can impact rates of release and Metabolism Etc but a lot of this is just Laura in fact I went into the literature to try and find any real concrete support for the idea that generic adderall is less potent or less effective than brand name Adderall and despite the tens of thousands of people who will say to the contrary I could not find any peer-reviewed published data about that so who knows maybe it's a belief effect as it's called maybe there's a real difference there nowadays modafinil and armodafinil are prescribed for a huge range of daytime sleepiness issues and we were talking about narcolepsy but there are also people who suffer from daytime sleepiness related to dementia daytime sleepiness related to post surgery anesthesia so there's this thing where people have surgery and then they come out of surgery and they feel better for a few days but then they find that they aren't recovering their normal levels of wakefulness so it's prescribed sometimes to try and get people back into a normal state of wakefulness it's been prescribed for a traumatic head injury after stroke again all of these prescribed uses have to be carried out by a certified physician you really don't want to start cowboying the use of modafinil or modafinil or any other prescription drug for that matter I must say that in discussing all these different drugs during today's episode I have zero knowledge of any of these drugs from a first-hand experience except for our modafinil back in 2017 I was prescribed a very very low dose of armodafinil for jet lag for daytime sleepiness issues really when I was traveling overseas to give a talk so our modafinil was given to me in a 25 milligram tablet it was advised to me that I take a half or even a quarter of that so I started with a quarter I am a believer in minimal effective dose I'm also somebody who's fairly hypersensitive to most medication so I took what I measured out to be five to seven milligrams of our modafinil and what I experienced was pretty profound certainly it relieved any daytime sleepiness in fact it made me feel extremely alert for a period of about four to six hours I can't say it was the most comfortable State although I did not feel as if I had racing heart or anything of that sort I basically felt as if I was in a narrow tunnel of attention for that entire period one thing I did not like about the experience is that it was a very hard experience to come down from there was no crash but I found that that high arousal State didn't taper off for many hours later even though it was most heightened for four hours I would say anywhere from 8 to 12 hours later I still felt like I was you know blinking once every four minutes or so and I've certainly been accused on this this podcast and at other times of blinking to seldom to my knowledge I don't have ADHD I've never been prescribed ADHD meds I've never been tested for ADHD I don't think I have ADHD and yet taking our modafinil certainly increased my levels of attention but at least by that one experience it's not something that I would want to repeat again I certainly would not want to be in that state for learning new material when I sit down to research a podcast or research papers in my lab or forage for information or learn from people or books or lectures or podcasts I want to be in a state of alertness but calm where I can really consider the ideas where I can script things out by hand I'm a big believer in writing things out by hand to remember them later drawing little diagrams I would not want to be in the state that even that very low dose of our modafinil put me in in order to learn and I should mention that both modafinil and armodafinil are associated with a good number of side effects if they don't agree with you or if the dosage is too high things like decreased appetite people get a run nose headache there's this instance of skin rashes in fact one of the reasons why modafinil and arm modafinil aren't more broadly prescribed is that there's a very rare skin condition in which people who have taken certain drugs not just modafin or arm modafinil have developed these very severe burn type blisters and in some cases this can be fatal this is again very rare and it was observed in at least one patient who took modafinil as part of a trial for modafinil as a treatment for ADHD it's called Stevens-Johnson syndrome please if you are squeamish to images of skin abrasions and lesions and things of that sort please don't look it up on the internet unless you're able to handle that and maybe not at all but the point here is that one of the reasons that modafinil in our modafinil are not more widely prescribed for ADHD and that it's still only prescribed off label is that Stephen Johnson syndrome was flagged as kind of a potential risk although the ADHD specialist that I spoke to are somewhat frustrated with that because they insist that the frequency of this syndrome that causes the skin rash that's sometimes fatal is no more frequent in those that took modafinil in this trial than with other drugs that have been approved so this gets into all sorts of issues around what drugs make it to approval and which ones don't and as we know modafinil and or modafinil are already being prescribed in the general population for other things this was dealing specifically with the question of whether or not it should be prescribed in kids with ADHD and certainly I am a proponent of exerting Extreme Caution when thinking about which drugs should be approved for the treatment of anybody but especially kids and to round out our discussion of drugs used for the treatment of ADHD that fall into let's call it the atypical category right the typical category being Adderall Vyvanse methylphenidate and things of that variety the less typical would be modafinil armodafone proprion Wellbutrin and so forth the last in this category of atypical is guanfacine guanfacine is an interesting compound it's a compound that was developed to lower blood pressure and indeed it does lower blood pressure and it is an alpha 2A Agonist Alpha 2A being a receptor for norepinephrine so guanfacine is a non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD and it's also used to treat some other conditions as well that is only working on the noradrenergic system it is not tapping into the dopamine system but all the other stuff that we talked about is really ramping up dopamine and norepinephrine guanfacine is only increasing norepinephrine and it's doing so by what we say agonizing or stimulating one particular aspect of the noradrenergic system and that's the alpha 2A system what's interesting about guanfacine is that it has a bunch of Pathways that it activates that feed back onto the autonomic nervous system to dampen down the activation of the sympathetic nervous system so whereas most of what we talked about today are sympathomimetics they tend to make us more ramped up more aroused and alert guanfacine is doing the opposite and as a consequence it's not prescribed that often because a lot of times when people take guanfacine it either has no effect on ADHD symptoms or it tends to make people feel very sleepy however there's a small subset of individuals by about five to ten percent of people that try it including kids that do get some significant relief from their ADHD symptoms and they seem to tolerate guanfacine better than they're tolerating some of the other drugs that we've talked about up until now the way guanfacine works is also really interesting you're now familiar with the locus ceruleus this little packet or we call it a nucleus of neurons in the back of the brain that release norepine different at other sites in the brain and they're going to be those Alpha 2A receptors that guanfacine works on and stimulates lots of different places in the brain related to increasing salience and relevance of particular stimuli that we see and that we need to attend to it appears that guanfacine can activate the prefrontal cortical networks in ways that are above their normal Baseline so that's good so improvements in executive function that Orchestra or teacher-like function we talked about before and can increase the efficacy of that output from Locus ceruleus and what that seems to do is increase the coordinated firing of locus ceruleus neurons with prefrontal cortex so in many ways it's acting like a fine-tuning of that Orchestra conductor operation that is so valuable in teaching these brain circuits during childhood of how to attend to one thing and ignore everything else so this is one reason why guanfacine is now approved not just for adults with ADHD but it's primarily used in kids age 6 to 17 years old for the treatment of ADHD again with the hope that these kids can take the drug and these circuits can learn how to focus and how to attend to certain things and limit impulsivity and hyperactivity and then perhaps come off the drugs although sometimes again people have to stay on them indefinitely the other thing about guanfacine is that because it lowers blood pressure and it has this effect of kind of dampening down overall sympathetic arousal sometimes it is prescribed in conjunction with other ADHD meds so yes there are kids out there and adults out there who are taking Adderall and guanfacine where they're taking Vyvanse and guanfacine and this is where it starts to get into drug cocktails and a bunch of other things that gets everybody a little bit uncomfortable I think because the idea of taking one drug to dampen down the side effects of another drug and to offset things and compensate you know is getting towards what's called poly pharmacology and uh you know I think it's understandable that people be concerned about that and yet again in reviewing this with some of the experts on ADHD there do seem to be a certain category of children out there and adults who really struggle with the standard ADHD meds and in that case guanfacine has provided a certain number of these individuals tremendous relief one note about guanfacine in no way shape or form am I encouraging anyone who's not prescribed guanfacine to take it but should you know someone who's taking guanfacine off label in order to improve their focus or enhance any aspect of their biology or psychology please let them know that it has a profound effect on lowering the tolerance for alcohol such that even small amounts of alcohol can lead to really serious problems and even potentially death so that's a very serious warning with guanfacine so today we discussed a lot of different compounds for the treatment of ADHD and it now should become clear what the general themes of those compounds is the general theme is that they tend to increase overall levels of arousal and wakefulness which leads to decreased levels of hyperactivity impulsivity and focus and on the face of it that might seem counter-intuitive raise arousal to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity indeed that's the case because these compounds because they act on neuromodulator systems like dopamine and norepine epinephrine are effective in creating neuroplasticity they change the strength of the connections in the neural circuits of the brain that lead to states of heightened focus and reduced impulsivity and reduced hyperactivity so we talked about the different mechanisms by which the different medications for ADHD accomplish this both the typical sort like methylphenidate and adderall and vivance and some of the atypical compounds that are now being used in addition such as modafinil or modafinil guanfacine and Wellbutrin and where possible I tried to highlight both the short and long-term effects of these various compounds and I try to address some of the major concerns about these compounds most notably the question of why are we putting so many kids on amphetamine and what is the long-term consequence of that and throughout today's episode I tried to highlight both the immediate and long-term benefits but also the immediate and long-term risks that can exist with these compounds certainly when taken without a prescription recreationally there is a real risk for abuse and addiction as well as even a risk for psychotic episodes but also the risks that accompany long-term use of these drugs in people with ADHD and yet it is also clear that not treating the symptoms of ADHD carry significant risk as well and what's very clear from the scientific and clinical literature and is covered in a significant amount of detail in the episode that I did about ADHD which you can find at hubermanlab.com is that combinations of drug treatments and behavioral protocols seem to surpass either drug treatments or behavioral protocols alone speaking to

Description:
In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.

Transcript Language: English
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris. Dr. Carhart-Harris is a distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of the leading researchers in the field of psychedelics and how they change neural circuitry in the brain. His laboratory is responsible for understanding, for instance, how psilocybin, also sometimes referred to as magic mushrooms change neural circuitry in the brain, such that new ideas and new forms of learning occur. His laboratory is also responsible for carrying out various clinical trials, some of which have demonstrated that appropriate dosages of psilocybin can alleviate major depression in more than 67% of people that take the drug. Now, this is not to say that everybody should take psilocybin, and today's discussion describes both the clinical trials and why treatments with psychedelics in some cases work and in some cases do not work in order to treat major depression. As well as discussions around psilocybin, lysogenic acid diethylamide, sometimes also referred to as LSD, as well as DMT. And how these change the brain, and how those brain changes can relate to changes in mental health, as it relates to depression and other psychiatric challenges, as well as how psychedelics are being applied in order to change neural circuitry for sake of expanding different aspects of the human mind, including creativity, intelligence, and much more. During today's discussion Dr. Carhart-Harris teaches us about the history of the study of psychedelics, as well as how the legislature, that is the laws surrounding psychedelics, are evolving in the United States and elsewhere for the use of psychedelics to treat psychiatric challenges. By the end of today's discussion, you will have a thorough understanding of how psychedelics work. Both in the short-term during the actual journey or trip. In fact, much of my discussion today with Dr. Carhart-Harris talks about the different aspects of the psychedelic journey and how those relate to therapeutic outcomes. And, of course, by the end of today's discussion, you will also understand the long-term effects of psychedelics, that is, how they can actually rewire the brain. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. One absolutely critical variable to getting excellent sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment. That is, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep at night, your body temperature needs to actually drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and alert, your body temperature has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. There are a lot of ways to control the temperature of your sleeping environment, but one of the best ways is to control the temperature of your actual mattress-- the surface that you're sleeping on. With Eight Sleep, you can do this very easily. There's a simple-to-use app where you can program in the temperature of your mattress across the night. So you can make it slightly cool at the beginning of the night, getting cooler, putting you into deep sleep, and then rapid eye movement sleep. And all of that, in terms of its impact on your sleep, can be tracked within the same app. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for more than two years now, and it has completely transformed my sleep. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman for their exclusive Memorial Day savings now through June 5 2023. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors in terms of your energy levels and your immediate and long term health are your blood glucose or blood sugar levels, as they're commonly called. With Levels, you can assess how different foods and activities impact your blood glucose levels. When I did this, it taught me several things. First of all, it taught me that certain foods really spike my blood glucose levels. And while spikes in blood glucose aren't always a bad thing, I was able to assess how certain foods were spiking my blood glucose too much, such that I would have post-eating dips in energy levels. And by removing those foods and substituting in other foods, it really evened out my energy levels. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Right now, Levels is offering an additional two free months of membership. Again, that's levels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone-IQ. Ketone-IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones. Now, most people have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet. But most people, including myself, are not on the ketogenic diet. That is, I and most people eat complex carbohydrates, fruits, and things of that sort in addition to quality proteins, et cetera. It turns out that even if you're not following a ketogenic diet, increasing your blood ketones can still have benefits. So for instance, I use Ketone-IQ anytime I want to do extended bouts of focused work. Preparing for podcast, research, writing grants, and if I ever want to exercise but I don't have time to eat or I don't want to have my gut full of food. Taking Ketone-IQ and thereby increasing my blood ketones allows me to do cognitive work or physical workouts without getting hungry and with plenty of energy and cognitive focus. If you'd like to try Ketone-IQ, you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off. Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman. I'm pleased to announce that I will be hosting two live events in September of 2023. The first live event will take place in Toronto on September 12. The second live event will take place in Chicago on September 28. Both live events will include a lecture and a question and answer period and are entitled, The Brain-Body Contract, during which I will discuss tools and science related to mental health, physical health, and performance. And I should mention that a lot of that content will have absolutely no overlap with content covered previously on the Huberman Lab podcast or elsewhere. If you're interested in attending either or both of these events, please go to hubermanlab.com/tour, and enter the code "Huberman" to get early access to tickets. Once again, that's hubermanlab.com/tour and use the code "Huberman" to access tickets. I hope to see you there. And now for my discussion with Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris. Dr. Carhart-Harris, welcome. I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time. I certainly have known who you are for quite a while, because I place you in this very small but very special and important category of researchers who has been pioneering the use of psychedelics for the treatment of specific clinical conditions, and really carrying the torch for, essentially, the entire field. So I want to start with a voice of gratitude and say thank you for doing this incredibly important work. Could you tell us a little bit about what psychedelics are? In fact, I'm curious as to how the name psychedelic ever came to be. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what you think they potentially reveal about the workings of the brain. And then we'll talk about the clinical applications. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure. Well, even that one is kind of hot one, because opinions differ on how to define psychedelic. But perhaps, a good starting place is to start with the etymology, where did the word come from? And it was a Brit excommunicated living in Canada Humphry Osmond who was due to present a paper at a National Academy of Sciences meeting on psychotomimetics-- drugs that mimic aspects of psychosis in their action. And certain drugs like mescaline-- let's see, 1956-- and LSD were on the bill. And he felt dissatisfied with them being under this category of psychotomimetics, and felt that the signature psychological effects of these compounds went beyond just mimicking psychotic symptoms. And so he wanted to find a more apt term to speak to, in a sense, the principal component of their action. And he jotted down a few different possibilities about a dozen or so, I think. And one of them was psychodelic, actually it started as and ended up being psychedelic. And he had a correspondence going on with another Brit also living in the US, Aldous Huxley, where they were playing with some terms to refer to these compounds. And in the end, Osmond won with psychedelic, and he had this little ditty of, to fathom hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic. That's where you put the disclaimer in. And so what does that mean? It's two ancient Greek words psyche, means the human mind or if we're being actually true to the ancient Greek it means soul. And then the other component means to make clear or to make visible or to make manifest or to reveal. So all of those work. And it's a neologism. It's a made up word. But it does have that ancient Greek origin. And it's speaking to this principle that these compounds reveal aspects of the psyche, of the human mind, the soul that are ordinarily not entirely visible. And so that's the etymology, and it's wonderfully poetic. But I happen to think it's also very accurate. It's a useful term, because it's sort of, you might say valence nonspecific. It doesn't say, you're going to have a great time or that you're going to go mad. It's more that-- it reveals a psyche, and it could be hellish but it could be heavenly. So that's the etymology and also a bit of the psychology. And sort of pointing to the phenomenology, the subjective experience. But there's also a pharmacology here. And quite recently, there was put out a consensus statement about psychedelics that's really referring to what we call the classic psychedelics to say that these are all compounds that work on a particular receptor in the brain, the serotonin 2A receptor. And that's another way that we could define these compounds. I said this one's a little hot, because I'm of the view that while the pharmacology is really useful, how the drugs work chemically, you can't avoid the phenomenology. And if we're true to the etymology, where the term came from, then we must recognize, and we cannot neglect the subjective experience. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for that beautiful description of what brought us to today in terms of using the word psychedelics. And now, it's thrown around all the time. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Too much. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Too much. And I'm guessing-- well, not guessing. I'm certain that it's also used to describe many compounds that don't touch the 5-HT2A, the serotonin 2A receptor. So there is a broader categorization by most people. And it'll be interesting to see where all the nomenclature and naming goes. For the time being, I'd love for you to tell us a bit more about this idea that psychedelics, however one defines them, can reveal something about the mind that can't be revealed otherwise. Are you talking about the subconscious? I mean, psychologists and most famously, Freud but also Jung and also neuroscientists, I think, think about subconscious processing. I think, perhaps, the most salient example for me that's outside the realm of anything psychedelic would be blindsight. This phenomenon that you take people that are blind but still have some connectivity in their brain and you present them a board with-- or a computer screen with different number of dots on each side and you say how many dots are on each side of the screen, and they say, what do you mean? I can't see the screen. I'm blind. And you say, well, just guess. And their guess rate is accurate far more than chance would predict. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they have so-called blindsight, and people have said, well, this is the subconscious revealing itself. There's no psychedelic drug involved. But what you're describing is a pharmacologic-induced state that reveals something that normally should we assume is masked or that we are oblivious to-- even though it's expressing itself. What does it mean for these drugs to be revealing something about the workings of the mind that would not be obvious to us, otherwise. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. So the example of blindsight is interesting but it's different. Blindsight would be referring to non-conscious processing, maybe implicit processing. So stuff going on in the mind in perception in a sense that is below the threshold of conscious awareness. But yet is influencing you. So it's sort-- it's kind of related, but it's different. So in depth, psychology, psychoanalysis, psychodynamic, psychology, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and so on. We talk about the unconscious. And there, it's more about the kind of blood and guts of the human condition, the human nature-- both the personal unconscious. So things that you might not want to necessarily be conscious of, because it's painful. So that's the repression aspect pushing it out of conscious awareness. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Repressed memories in particular? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Like traumatic memories, difficult relationships. It could be complex trauma, not necessarily just a specific index trauma, but a series of trauma. And then you have the collective unconscious, which was really Carl Jung's contribution to say that there's a transpersonal quality to the unconscious. There's aspects about humans, not just this individual human. There's aspects to our minds, our psyches that are not fully available to conscious awareness, but can come up in certain states. Psychoanalysis went crazy for dreaming as their royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious. That was Freud. But we now with psychedelics, and this was what drew me into the area. Was discovering literature that was speaking to this particular action, the psychedelic action. And was saying that when these drugs-- like LSD, psilocybin found in magic mushrooms, when they're used in psychotherapy, material comes up that may be may have been repressed that is of therapeutic value and awareness and insight of this material seems to catalyze the therapeutic process with strong emotional release. These cathartic experiences and insights. Whether they're insights that are personal or whether they're transpersonal. But for me, this is really where the meat of it is with psychedelics and classic psychedelics, in particular. The likes of compounds like LSD and psilocybin. I would say that if it wasn't for this action by classic psychedelics, we wouldn't be so interested in psychedelics. I think, if we only had compounds like ketamine, MDMA cannabis, that could be said, broadly speaking, to be psychedelic-like. I don't think it necessarily would have captured the world's attention as psychedelics are right now. I actually think it's a major gap to fill. Is this principal action of the classic psychedelics. What does this mean that I'm referring to? Psyche-revealing. What is that? And I suppose where I'm going with this is, what is that in terms of the biology as well? What's going on in the brain and the body when people become aware of things that previously they weren't fully aware of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to talk about some of the clinical trials that you've been involved with. In particular, looking at psilocybin. As you mentioned, the principal hallucinatory psychedelic agent in magic mushrooms. I'd like to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question just so that everyone's on the same page. I've read the papers that you've published and that others have published in this area. And typically, the dosages used in these trials are 25 milligrams of psilocybin. And we talk about one recent trial, in particular, that compared 25 to 10 milligrams to more frequent use of very small amounts. 1 milligram over 3 weeks, for instance. However, when people talk about magic mushrooms, they often talk about gram doses of the mushroom, because I'm assuming that they contain milligram dosages of psilocybin. Here, we're not encouraging use of any kind. These are clinical trials. But for clarity of understanding, what is the conversion, typically? Like 1 gram of magic mushrooms will contain how many milligrams of psilocybin on average. Because what I'm trying to do here is calibrate people to this idea of microdosing versus macrodosing. And that's fairly straightforward to do with respect to the clinical trials. But then in a lot of the lay discussion around this, you hear about heroic doses versus microdoses. And so I think there's a lot of confusion. So if you would, educate us on this idea of what's a microdose. And perhaps, also how many milligrams of psilocybin are contained in a gram of quote unquote, "magic mushrooms?" ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure. Well, a microdose is neither of these are that. Simple. But they're fun. It's a fun challenge. But microdose, one definition is that it's a dose of typically a classic psychedelic like LSD or psilocybin that has some perceptible psychedelic effects. It doesn't put you into a noticeable altered state of consciousness that feels like you're tripping. And if that was LSD, it looks as though the threshold is around about, let's see, 10, 11, 12 micrograms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Micrograms. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Micrograms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Want to be very clear here. Micrograms. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 10 micrograms of LSD, are you saying will not induce visual hallucinations in most people? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So that's threshold level. That's about the level that some people who are sensitive could feel it. But if you were to talk to the microdosing gurus, they might say that that's the ballpark for an LSD dose that you would consider a micro dose, and then you would take semi-regularly. It's typically something like one day on, one day off or one day on, two days off. This kind of thing. There's different protocols. And yeah. So some like Jim Fadiman-- one of the popularizers of microdosing, I think would say that a true microdose should be sub-perceptible. You shouldn't feel it, yet the assumption is it's going to change you in some way on a kind of trait level more than a state level, and maybe behaviorally. And the typical story goes, it will improve well-being. And maybe, maybe, it could improve certain aspects of cognition, say, related to creative thinking. I emphasize the maybe there because that's another angle with microdosing. We're waiting for some compelling evidence. As things stand right now, I'd say, we lack that compelling evidence. There's some suggestive stuff, but often the study designs aren't that strong. It's really hard to do a study with microdosing, because you need to have permission to give people a microdose that for practical reasons, they would go home with, otherwise, you're requiring them to be in the lab, say three times a week for x number of weeks to meet the criteria of a course of microdosing, which might be two or three times a week for say, a month. And that's a hard thing to do in a lab study. It's expensive. You'd need to do that against a suitable control, so a placebo control. And there is a study that's been done in New Zealand that has some interesting preliminary data that did-- I think did the design right. But it hasn't been published yet. I've seen some positive findings presented around improvements in mood. But it's a bit early to get too excited about that. It needs to go through peer review and all that. But as things stand, the evidence is pretty thin. And we have to be honest about that. We did quite a creative study with my colleagues at Imperial. The guy leading that, Balazs Szigeti, a Hungarian chap, did a really creative design. Very much his brainchild. He instructed people to do their own blinding, their own placebo-controlled blinding of their own microdosing. So this was a classic citizen science study like do it yourself science where they would get their LSD tabs and chop them up, put them into gel capsules, opaque, and have other capsules that are the placebos that they just close empty capsule. And then there was a whole barcode scan technique so that you kind of shuffle them up. But they've got the barcode in, the QR code. So you can break the code later on, but once you've shuffled them up, you no longer know which ones had the microdosing and which ones are empty. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was this LSD? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: This was LSD. Also tried it with mushrooms, but the issues with the mushrooms was people would burp sometimes. They'd belch. And then they'd have this mushroom taste. So then he instructed people to get some non-psychoactive mushroom material to put in. So it's really-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not an easy study. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --not an easy study. And it was-- I love that kind of science. Real creative first mover kind of science. And the results were fascinating, because the short story is that the microdosing didn't compellingly beat the placebo. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It did not. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It didn't. And he controlled, because he asked. He controlled for expectancy. So people's positive expectancy, which is, in a sense, the vehicle that carries the placebo response. It's why you have a placebo. Is that positive expectancy can drive a therapeutic effect to a large extent. So you measured that pre-trial and then used it to correct for the response. And how did it work? Those who got a placebo but thought they got a microdose did as well as those who thought they got a microdose and did get a microdose. So it was the bigger effect-- the majority of the effect was in thinking that you got a microdose. So in a sense, it was a victory for the power of the placebo response. And it's created all sorts of controversy. People don't want to believe it, that kind of thing. But that's the beauty of science, isn't it? That science is not about what you want to believe. That right there is the beauty of science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that experiment. Kudos to them. I'm not going to attempt to say his last name correctly. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I tried. Yeah. Probably you made a mess of it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. No. I think you got it. You were involved in a clinical trial that was published last year comparing 25 milligrams of psilocybin to 10 milligrams of psilocybin to a drug called escitalopram. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Lexapro. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lexapro? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this 1 milligram over a 3-week dosage. I'm wanting to discuss the results of that study a bit and some of the other trials that you've done involving psilocybin for depression, the treatment of depression. Could we calibrate ourselves? 25 milligrams of psilocybin, is that what-- it's going to be a perceptible dose presumably. Hallucinations and all that. And is that what one would find in-- I'm guessing here, if I'm accurate, this does not mean that I have experience here. But 2 grams of mushrooms? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's more than that we think. Yeah. Sorry. I missed that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, no. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I missed that one. Went off on a tangent. But yeah. 25 milligrams of psilocybin would be-- we don't know, and it's important that I say that because I wouldn't want people to hear my answer here, and then use it to calibrate their own dosing of mushrooms and get it way off. So it's guesswork. And I would love to see someone do a proper study on it. And look at the psilocybin content in a given mass of psilocybin mushrooms, magic mushrooms. But to my knowledge, that hasn't really been done. Someone like Paul Stamets would give a better answer here. But I think the percentage within the mushroom mass is-- of psilocybin in the mushroom mass and psilocin which is the metabolite of psilocybin is something in the 1%, a little bit higher, maybe, range. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So 1 gram, 1000 milligrams of magic mushroom would contain about 10 milligrams of psilocybin. Is that right? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Broadly speaking, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Great. That helps calibrate. And I think, again, just allows the layperson to understand a bit more of where we're headed with these psilocybin trials and the results. So we don't have to restrict our discussion to just that I clinical trial. But if we include that one and compare it to some of the other trials that you've done, I mean, your laboratory is seeing phenomenal-- in my opinion, phenomenal results in the treatment of, otherwise, intractable depression, major depression, which so many people suffer from. From two-- I suppose there two sessions of using psilocybin in these ranges of 10 to 25 milligrams. Do I have that correct? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Could we talk a little bit about what people typically experience during those sessions that allows this phenomenal transformation of mood and state and trait as well? And I'm especially interested in whether or not it is the experience during those sessions that is the trigger that's necessary for the transformation from a depressed to a non-depressed state. Because the impulse is to think it is. That what one thinks and sees and hallucinates is-- and hears is so vital. But of course, these drugs can create neuroplasticity changes in our neural wiring, presumably for long periods of time. So what are your thoughts on the experience itself? And maybe for those who have not done these compounds before, you could explain a little bit about what's typical for people, and what you think is leading to that incredible positive and pervasive change in mood, state, and trait. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I would say that it's more than impulse that is leading us to think that the experience is important. It's really data and converging evidence now. So independent teams, independent studies are converging on the magnitude of certain kinds of experience rated, yes, with subjective rating scales is predicting therapeutic outcomes. Pretty strongly and very reliably. And so that's guiding us. Now, could you say, well, maybe those experiences are some kind of epiphenomenon of say, a central brain action? Well, absolutely. But then all experience are epiphenomenon by that principle. And yet we care about it, you know? And it matters to us and in our human relations with each other. So I think it does matter to a human being when they're in say, a psilocybin therapy session, and as the drug effects begin to come on and the body starts to feel a little strange and tingly and there's some initial anxiety. And then in their mind's eye, they start to notice patterns and maybe colors and then, maybe, those patterns deepen and they're dynamic and they have this fascinating organic quality. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are they-- patients in your studies typically using an eye mask? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they're in the eye mask? So eyes closed? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's why you said mind's eye as opposed to looking out into the clinical setting. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. And that's one of the major differences to psychedelic therapy versus taking a psychedelic. Is you shut your eyes. And it's a world away from taking a psychedelic. Yeah. A rave or something. In a sense, good luck with that. But in psychedelic therapy, yeah. It's settled conditions. There's music playing. And what I'm describing here is very much the default. There's actually very little variability between the different sites that have done this work on these conditions. Typically, it's two people. Ideally, mental health professionals, at least one who's a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist or some other kind of psychotherapist or psychiatric nurse. But ideally, two who meet those criteria with a individual who's ingested the drug and music playing throughout. A kind of runway into taking the drug and then throughout, so there's continuity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're music with lyrics or without lyrics? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Without lyrics, to begin with, and the music typically is spacious to begin with. And then builds and becomes atmospheric. There might be, I don't know, some tribal drums in the distance or something as it develops or like the sound of a bird in the distance. A call. And then as it gets into more stronger drug effects, the music starts to coax emotion, and very intentionally, strings, for example, would come in and it would be an interesting experiment and one that we'd love to do actually to see whether if you were to pull that out, whether the psychedelic experience would be as emotionally intense as it is in psychedelic therapy when you have music there as a default. And across the board, people should find this remarkable, because it kind of is. All of the published studies that are now having such an impact on psychiatry and beyond have music there as a staple component. And we just take it as assumption that it needs to be. I tend to share that assumption. But it's remarkable that it hasn't been tested properly. But it's there. And if you were to run with that, and if you had a critical agenda, you would say, well, this is music therapy. Why are you making all this fuss about psychedelics when it's music that's there in all of these trials with all these fantastic findings. So there is something to that. And this will tee me up probably to talk about psychedelic-therapy being a combination treatment. We have a hyphen between the two, because I share the hypothesis. The assumption that should be tested better. There is a positive interaction between the two. That there's a synergy between the two. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's why it's psychedelic-therapy with a hyphen, just like Carhart-Harris. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: OK. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a quick break, and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2. This is extremely useful to hear because I think most people think, OK. Psychedelic. Whether or not they have experience with psychedelics or not, get some visual hallucinations, some auditory hallucinations, some synesthesia, some visual auditory blending, somatosensation, you know? Rubbing a surface and being able to elicit the sounds in one's mind. Of course, et cetera. But so seldom do we actually hear about the specifics of these clinical trials in a way that, for instance, points to music as one of the, perhaps, key variables. Now, you mentioned that as people enter these psychedelic states, that there's a little bit of initial anxiety. About a year and a half ago, I had a discussion with Dr. Matthew Johnson who's running some psilocybin trials at Johns Hopkins, as you know. And he mentioned the critical importance, at least in his mind, to this idea of the patient, quote unquote, "letting go" or allowing the experience to take them someplace mentally as opposed to trying to constrain their sensory and cognitive experience. I'm curious what your reflections are on that idea. And why it might be so valuable clinically. And this ties back to this earlier discussion we were having about the unconscious or about psychedelics revealing something that's there all the time but that we don't have access to. And again, I'm struggling to find the right language for this, because we don't really have a neural mechanism like top-down inhibition or something like that to explain how this unconscious might be uncorked in the psychedelic experience. But to make it quite simple and direct, how important do you think it really is for the patient to feel like they are, quote unquote, "letting go" and what in the world is "letting go" in biological terms? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think we'll get there in terms of having the neural correlates of the mind revealing itself to itself. The emergence of the unconscious into consciousness or unconscious material into conscious awareness. It's a wonderful challenge. It's a huge challenge, but it's a challenge to embrace. And letting go very much is, again, a staple component of how the different teams do this work in terms of encouraging a willingness to let go. And when we started out doing our depression work and did that first trial, it was the first trial of psychedelic in a formally diagnosed depression, you know? Where that was the target population. A depressed population. It was the first modern study to do that. And we visited Hopkins, friends there and were mentored on how to do the guiding Bill Richards, Mary Cusumano. They were just so brilliant and wise in their guidance to us as how to do the guiding in our trial. And so this phrase of trust, let go, be open, you'll hear a lot. I don't know who fairly it should be attributed to, but I would attribute it to Bill Richards. Yeah. Everything's borrowed. You probably got it from someone else. But it's such a key principle. And it's almost like a mantra that you're trying to instill in people. Trust, let go, be open. And those different components where the trust is about the therapeutic rapport that, again, this goes beyond just intuition now. We formerly measured therapeutic rapport. We do it even with just a single item, a visual analog scale item, a subjective rating scale item on the morning of dosing, and we find that it's a significant predictor of the quality of the experience that you have under the drug in the psychedelic therapy, and then the therapeutic outcomes x weeks or months later. So very powerful chain of predictive components there, but trust, essentially, important. And again, not just to intuition but the data pointing to that. Let go, there's a readiness to surrender, to let go, to not resist. And we do measure that too and see that it's predictive of response. And then the being open is about a willingness to go there, to confront, to be inquisitive. Something that's easier said than done. Can be terrifying. When you're dealing with a very vulnerable population, it's probably more-- the rule then, the exception that they're carrying some significant adversity, life adversity or frank trauma that they've suffered. And so that message of be open, be willing to confront and to go there is really powerful. And that's how it plays out. And often, there is struggle. There's something going on that is I don't want to be feeling this. Make it stop. That can be nightmarish at times, but it's very, very strong. And with these big doses that we give, it's very strong. And actually, a student that I've worked with, I think now doing a PhD, at Harry Brouwer is working on a fantastic project characterizing the different phases of the psychedelic experience where the early phase is dominated by negative emotions and negatively-valenced feelings of anxiety and struggle. And then it's a different story in the latter half. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask about that? First of all, I think that's fascinating and important to analyze the different phases and, again, I'm delighted here because people typically hear about a psychedelic journey but we never really hear about the stereotypic components of the beginning, middle, and end of that journey. We know that there's a peak and that there's a parachuting down and et cetera. But when you say that typically there's an anxiety, maybe some negative valence in the early stage, do you mean about the sensations people are experiencing or about some prior event that's being called to mind that they're remembering? Likewise, for the positive phase of the psychedelic journey or trip are people-- do they still call it a trip? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: All right. For the-- I guess, we'll use trip. For the psychedelic trip. Are people feeling positive about the experience like, uh. Like there's been some sort of breakthrough or they're in a calmer state, or is it that they tend to be focusing on prior events that were positive. So in other words, is there a threading through of some concept that comes to mind for people? Maybe about an earlier trauma or maybe about a sense of self or a sense of other forgiveness. It could be any of these things. But what do we know about the finer details of all that? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. I would say, the initial struggle is more against the general drug effects than pinning it on something specific. It's more that normal waking consciousness. We have a sense, generally speaking, if we're well or well enough, a sense of assuredness about what is a table here and so on. And we have that assuredness to an extent about ourselves as well. It might be illusory, but we have it. And what the drug's doing is it's breaking down all of that. And it's scary as hell. And if it's a big dose, it's just like human nature to rage against that a bit and a bit like dying. I don't want this. It feels like I could be dying. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I might lose my mind. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. That too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd never come back. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Those two are the classics. Is oh, but I might know that I've taken a psychedelic and I might even know a bit about psychedelics, but I still fear that I'm going to go mad or I know that generally speaking, these drugs don't have a high fertility risk. I still think I'm going to die. And it's very palpable and that comes up. So yeah. I mean, those are the core fears. That those two and very reliably, that comes up. And it's really like a basic drug action. It's dose-dependent but it's a basic drug action that is forcing something about the nature of the mind and the way it's made up that makes it feel that way, but it feels like I'm losing my mind or it feels like I could lose my mind or that I could go insane or that maybe I'm dying here and this is bad. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You've talked many times before and have done really wonderful work looking at the changes in communication between different brain areas while people are under the influence of psychedelics. And I think the gestalt of those data, correct me if I'm wrong, is that compared to the non-psychedelic state, that under psychedelic influence. There is far more-- let's just call it interconnectivity or communication between brain areas that typically aren't communicating, which probably is not surprising to people given the subjective effects of these drugs. What is the evidence that after the psychedelic journey is over, that some or perhaps all of that enhanced communication across brain areas is maintained? And if so, what role do you feel that could play in these incredible positive therapeutic outcomes? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. So we've had some recent findings in that direction where, yes, it's true. And picture says a thousand words that some people might be familiar with are these two circles project that we did in collaboration with some researchers where ordinarily, the communication is going on within systems like other regions of the visual system will be speaking mostly within the visual system. There'll be a kind of cliquishness or a modularity to the quality of the communication in the brain. And then the cool finding with psilocybin was the first paper, is that the communication, yes. It transcends these modules and becomes much more inter-modular crossing different modalities and that effect correlated with the magnitude of the subjective effects and then we replicated it with LSD using different methods. And a new paper will come out soon with DMT showing a similar effect. It's a bit of a debate about what regions are most implicated. But the general effect of an increase in global functional connectivity is what we call it or global communication in the brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this is while under the influence of these drugs. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: This is under the-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So putting people into a brain scanner while they are under the influence of the drug. Is that right? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That itself must be quite an experience, given that these scanners are small tubes. You're in a bite bar, you've got a bite bar in your mouth. That's quite a study. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: You don't always have a bite bar, at least with the psychedelics. But yeah. You've got to keep your head still. And you have the loud MR scanner noise going. But because it's regular, there aren't too many surprises. So it's actually surprisingly tolerable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're in a hospital setting. So you're not worried about what would happen if you had a cardiac event or something. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. You got professionals around, and most people generally tolerate that setting quite well, surprisingly well. But yeah. We do all that. And yes, we do see the opening up of the communication across systems in the brain. And it does speak to intuition about the subjective experience. The different modalities might be blending with each other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry for interrupting, but I have to ask, is it thought that the activation of the serotonin 2A receptors what's responsible for the increased communication between brain areas that under normal circumstances would not be communicated? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. So there's a few reasons why some modeling work that-- computational modeling work that first identifies where the 2A receptor is and then looks at-- models its basic effect on neural activity. Will recapitulate the-- or recreate the effect that we see actually in the data with the scanning. So doing the computational modeling. You can see the same effect by knowing where the key receptors are and then making them do a certain thing that we know psychedelics do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I can imagine two possibilities. And I think it's important to distinguish between these two. One possibility is that the activation of this serotonin 2A receptor leads to increased connectivity and thereby auditory and visual hallucinations emerge, changed patterns of thinking emerge, et cetera. That's the obvious interpretation. But the scientist in me has to ask, is it possible that all of that increased connectivity is occurring, and yet that is a distinct phenomenon layered on top of some other effect of the psychedelic drugs impacting access to the unconscious, hallucinations? In other words, is it the increased connectivity that's leading to the subjective experience, or are those two things happening in parallel? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, they happen in parallel and they map to each other. But the question of causality, what causes what, is the tricky thing where I would suggest that the causality is circular. That they influence each other. And this gets a bit philosophical. But it matters, because otherwise, there's a trap that it's easy to fall into where you're thinking that it's all about the brain action causing the subjective experience. And that's typically what we do in cognitive neuroscience. It's like the first port of call materialist approach. But one can be a materialist, essentially, but still appreciate that circular causality that mind also interacts with brain. And it's so hard to pick the two apart. And there is a kind of essential dualism where subjective experience is a thing in and of itself. But that's not to divorce it from what's going on the biological level. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The reason I ask is because as I understand it, nowadays, there's a bit of a movement within the scientific community that studies psychedelics to develop drugs that can, essentially, cure or alleviate many of the symptoms of depression or trauma that are built off our understanding of how psychedelics like psilocybin and here I'll throw MDMA in there, although classically not a psychedelic, it gets lumped in. We can get back to that later. But that do not produce hallucinations or massive changes in subjective experience. Actually, I think this is what initially got us into conversation on Twitter as I had learned about this paper published out of a group at UC Davis. That essentially modifying psychedelics so that they have potential therapeutic application for the treatment of depression but zero hallucinogenic properties. And I thought, wow. This is going to be a very controversial thing in the world, right? Because the history of psychedelics, as you pointed out, has been one of people accessing different modes of thinking, feeling. Seeing things and letting go. Trust, et cetera. A therapeutic relationship. And here we have-- I don't want to say pharma because it's not really pharma, but we have laboratories who are trying to tease apart the activation of receptors independent of all that subjective experience in order to, essentially, treat the same conditions. I'd love for you to comment on this, where you think it might be going. And whether or not you think that's the right or the wrong approach, if it has any validity at all. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It is pharmas, just smaller pharma, sort of startup pharma. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So because pharma would like to have drugs that can cure depression but don't make people hallucinate. Is that correct? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Oh, they would. And patients might and the system would love it, because the system is used to it. It's medicine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. And it doesn't give this mental imagery of the Summer of Love in San Francisco or of kaleidoscope eyes, right? It's more of-- ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can imagine, the more-- I have to be careful with my wording here. Those who would not be inclined toward that might embrace a therapeutic that is strictly effective at treating depression with no hallucinations. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And it doesn't look like an individual lying on a sofa crying their eyes out about the life that they've lived. And that deep catharsis being life-transforming. Is very different from that model. I'm skeptical of it for a few reasons. And one is that I can't see the logic-- I can't see the pieces fit in a way that's compelling. And I'm also skeptical, because I think it could easily be wishful thinking, because of that point that patients would like it and the system would like it. And you got to bear that in mind as well. So wouldn't it be convenient if it were true and you could get the therapeutic action without the psychedelic effects? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, in a way, that's a little bit of what microdosing seems to be designed to do. Like you said, take dosages that are below that perceptual or awareness of some effect threshold over a longer period of time in an attempt to ping the circuits or alter the circuits but not hallucinate. Not have a catharsis. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So if microdosing can do that, and it's sub-perceptible, then microdosing isn't a psychedelic action, because whereas the psychedelic action. When psychedelic, when defined, means psyche revealing. You're not getting that effect. You might be getting the pharmacology, you might be getting some direct serotonin to a receptor agonism that could be driving a therapeutic response, but you can get that with SSRIs as well. And so my point is, what's new? OK. Maybe it's a bit new and people are now developing direct 2A agonists rather than indirect through a serotonin releaser like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the SSRIs like Lexapro. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are there any SSRIs that selectively agonize, which folks by the way means, activate, in a good way. Agony sounds terrible. Those not informed might think that mean that disrupt. But that can activate the serotonin 2A receptor. Are there any drugs that will do that are not psychedelic? I'm not aware of any, but then again I'm not a psychopharmacologist. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, there are. I mean, are there any that are licensed and used as medicines in psychiatry? I actually had this debate recently on social media, and I couldn't see a compelling example. I saw 2A agonists that were used for other things. You have a compound like Lesuride used in treating Parkinson's, but actually it's more of a dopamine agonist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. So they're always hitting other things, right? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're always tapping other neurotransmitters-- ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: All that being used for other things. So is there a selective serotonin 2A receptor stimulator, an agonist, that isn't psychedelic, that is therapeutic in psychiatry and the answer firmly is, no. I haven't seen it yet. Will they develop one? Well, for patients sake, I hope so. Because it would be great. Let's wait and see. If they do, I doubt it'll be psychedelic and I doubt it would have much to do with psychedelic therapy. And it would be much more like the system we're used to of chronic pharmacotherapy. Take your drug every day. Let's hope they find it and it works for patients sake. But as things stand right now, I'm a little skeptical. Now, some of the findings that are being seen that are really exciting, fantastic work being done, showing things like increases in the communication components of neurons, dendritic growth, spine growth, synaptic spine growth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, by the way, folks, just I'll interrupt for not necessarily spine-- not the cerebral column but spines are these little tiny twigs with bulbs on the end of neurons that allow for communication points between neurons. So neuroplasticity is often associated with growth of dendrites and spines and so forth, which is what Robin's referring to. That reminds me, and I just want to make sure that we close the hatch on the earlier answer, because I interrupted you. Is the increased connectivity between-- or communication between brain areas that's observed while people are under the influence of the psychedelic also observed later after the effects of the drug wear off? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And then I'll just throw in another question there, because we're on to this topic now. To what extent do we think that neuroplasticity, structural changes in neurons, functional changes in neurons are responsible for that? And how long does that last? Let's say I come into your clinic, I'm a subject in your experiment, I take-- come in the morning, I do my psychedelic journey five or six hours later. I'm parachuting back to reality, as we call it, and then I go home. Increase connectivity lasts for how long, and how long are the structural brain changes occurring? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, you're asking fantastic questions, and partly because we don't have the answer yet. But we do have some data. And so we have looked at, first of all, in a sense, the functional plasticity of what we assume it to be or at least the functional changes, the increase in communication across systems that increase in global connectivity, functional connectivity. Do we see it after the trip? We know we see it during the trip pretty well replicated correlating with intense drug effects. Do we see it after the trip? Well the answer is, we've seen it in two different depression cohorts, psilocybin therapy for depression. In one study where we looked the next day, we saw it. A kind of residual effect similar to what you see acutely being seen the next day. And then in a subsequent study, we saw it also three weeks later. So we've seen it in two independent data sets. This decrease in modularity is how we measure it. It's the same thing, essentially. Broadly speaking, it's the same thing. An increase in global connectivity, functional connectivity. And actually, unpublished we've seen it in healthy volunteers on a correlational level. Not on an absolute change level, but if you look at its relationship to a mental health outcome, and this is an important thing to stress with the depression work, we saw a relationship between the magnitude of that change, the decrease in modularity or increase in global connectivity, and the improvement in symptom severity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So interesting. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And just to state it a different way, so what Robin is referring to is when you say modularity, as neuroscientists, we think of the different modular networks of the brain. The eye talks to a region of the thalamus involved in vision, which talks to the visual cortex, which eventually converges with auditory information, of course. But there's a separation or modularity of function. This increased connectivity is cross-modular in during the trip, but afterwards as well. And you're saying that that correlates very strongly with the strength of the therapeutic outcome for depression. I mean, the logical extension of that is that extreme modularity of brain function is depressive in some way. Now, we don't want to go too far, but what does that mean that increasing crosstalk between different modules of the brain is so strongly correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: We don't other than there's a relationship. I mean, this is the thing. We need to be a little careful not to run with it too far. I mean, there's some things that it suggests. I think it suggests a more flexible mode of brain functioning, if you're not getting stuck in modules or the modules aren't excessively cut off from each other. But you see different things with different presentations if you were to look at cognition. Sharper cognition is actually associated with more modularity. So it's a rule that's a little slippery. And we need to be careful with it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again, forgive me for interrupting, but I think I have friends who are-- I would say, are on the spectrum. Who are very linear in their thinking and extremely intelligent in the kind of classic sense of being able to ratchet through hard problems to arrive at a solution. And then I have friends who are-- let's just call them what they are. From the creative communities outside of science that are very expansive, they see connections between many different things, but sometimes, you have to-- not all of them, but you have to catch their ideas with a butterfly net. And oftentimes, what they're saying sometimes it just doesn't make any sense. Now, they also produce incredible creative works. But to have a conversation with them is anything but a linear experience. They are not random thought generators, but there's a non-linearity or randomness to their processing that's distinct from these other folks that I'm describing on the spectrum. And of course, it's a spectrum. There's a whole range in between. It sounds to me like there is some therapeutic value to being able to move along this continuum from the more linear to the nonlinear. Is that correct? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, I think so. Yeah. It's resonating what you're saying. It's speaking to my intuition. That you could be very passy, passing things up, chopping things up like an analytical scientist like I'm doing a bit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A splitter as we say in science. You're either a lumper or a splitter. Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: The way I'm being very particular about when to call something psychedelic. That kind of passy analytical way of thinking you might associate with a more modular system. Whereas the system that's more globally, interconnected, and open, yeah. Might be more flexible and creative and divergent in the associations and so on so. Yes. That's speaking to my intuition to how you're describing it. And I imagine, if you take severe psychopathology, severe mental illness like a depression, I've always thought that there's something intuitive about the term itself. Like a depression in a landscape, which is a halt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Physical depression. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: A physical depression that is easy to fall into. And if you do, it's hard to get out of. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So almost-- if I understand what you're saying correctly, almost like getting stuck at one location on this continuum. Because most people don't reside at one extreme or the other full time. They can kind of migrate back and forth between expansive states and more linear states. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Like you do with low mood. If you're "healthy" in inverted commas, you can feel your low mood, your disappointment. But you can spring back. But someone with-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you know you can spring back. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Whereas the suicidal depressive person or suicidally depressed person, somehow, at least in my understanding, there's something about that extreme depressive states and extreme anxiety states, something my laboratory is a bit more familiar with anxiety, which alters the perception of time such that people feel like that negative state is going to go on forever or that if it goes away, that it's going to return at random. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Kind of a vulnerability to the time domain. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. And it's so tragic, that cognitive bias in depression that everything's hopeless and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah. Yes. So if you were to get stuck in that rut and have that bias, then you're cut off from other things, other sensory modalities or modules, cut off from the world, cut off from other people. Stuck in your inner rut. So yes. I think we're sharing this intuition that a decrease in modularity or an opening up of the system, the brain could relate to an opening up of the mind that is enduring after the psychedelic dosing session. And yeah. And the third replication was to see in healthies an improvement in well-being. Because they're healthy, we don't look at depression. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are people that are healthy walking into the trial? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Take psilocybin twice? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, actually they do. But the first dose is 1 milligram, which they don't feel it's a placebo dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quote unquote, "micro dose." Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. We stick EGG on their heads to measure their brainwaves during each dose. And 1 milligram, you see no change. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that, you microdosers. No, I'm just kidding. I mean, nothing against the micro doses. I've always just been a little bit skeptical based on my conversations with the scientists actually doing the work with psychedelics. It seems like the answer keeps coming back. 1 or 2, maybe 3 macro doses in a controlled safe setting. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, that's compelling. The evidence for that is compelling. And that's what's making all the difference right now. Microdosing is just appealing, but again, science isn't about what we want to believe, it's about what's actually coming through and what seems to hold up to testing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors, which is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means, plenty of salt-- sodium, magnesium, and potassium, the so-called electrolytes and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular, to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially, if I've been sweating a lot and certainly, I drink LMNT in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna, because that causes quite a lot of sweating. If you'd like to try LMNT you can go to drinklmnt-- that's L-M-N-T.com/huberman to claim a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklmnt-- L-M-N-T.com/huberman. Would you say that's right? That one or two or three sessions, and how far apart are those typically spaced in time? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Typically, one to three weeks across the sites is the way people are doing the psychedelic therapy dosing sessions. Two sessions, you know, Hopkins, Imperial, NYU. That's been a kind of default to-- we actually use three in a current anorexia trial, psilocybin therapy for anorexia. Two patients left to see after 19 who've gone through the trial. Very exciting results there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're seeing an alleviation of the obsessive thought about food and a willingness to consume healthier amounts of food. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Even improved weight at the long follow-up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So critical. When we did an episode on eating disorders, I learned that anorexia nervosa, which by the way folks, the rates are not increasing. It's been pretty stable through time despite what's said about social media, and et cetera. But anorexia nervosa being the most deadly of all psychiatric illnesses, which is a big statement, because manic depression, so-called bipolar depression, has a 20 to 30 times the typical suicide rate. Basically, many people with anorexia, I think is how it's-- is what one says, not anorexics. But people with anorexia often die. Many of them die. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. So tragic. So often young people as well. And similarly, with suicide in terms of premature death. So the tragedy with psychiatry is so strong. It's so rewarding to be doing that trial and to be seeing good results. I have to check myself a little bit that I'm reporting on it in this really promisory way and the trial isn't yet publicly released and published. So it's still ongoing as well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that was three sessions. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It is three sessions. And I can't say what the dosage is, because we still have-- there is a blinding component. But there are three dosing sessions in there. Let's see now. I think they're two weeks apart and we do the follow-up. Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to close out this description of the journey and the trip by extending past the day when people actually take the drug into this-- what I've described as the integration phase. You have to re-integrate. All this increased connectivity during the session. Hallucinations, insights, anxiety, letting go. Maybe revelation, maybe epiphany. OK. Great. At what point is that consolidated? Meaning, are these patients or subjects in studies having daily conversation with their therapist? Are they journaling every day? And I want to keep in mind that most people are not going to be part of a clinical trial. And of course, here we're not suggesting what people do or not do. But let's just put it this way. Were people to use psychedelics, what is the way that people can maximize on the neuroplasticity and the brain changes in a positive way in the days and weeks afterwards? In other words, how long does this so-called integration last? And how far can we take this? I mean, I could imagine that how often one chooses to think about the insights could also have an impact. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right? Because clearly people went to raves, clearly people did psychedelics in the '60s. We don't know if clearly people do psychedelics now. But we don't have data on those people. You have access to the understanding of how they're spending their time and the therapeutic outcomes, which we haven't gotten to the numbers yet, but again, are incredibly impressive. In upwards of, as I understand it, 60% or more people getting relief from depression. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. 70%, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 70%. Incredible, especially when compared to the typical antidepressant treatments and so on. So what is this business of integration? How is it done properly? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Gosh. Well, how long does it last as well? A lifetime? You know? Life is a journey like a trip is a journey. And there's always work to do. As Jack Kornfield says, after the, ecstasy the laundry. And you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. There'll be other good ones as well, but forget them. But yeah. So the work is ongoing, and yeah. But this gives you a foot up. It enables people to do the work more easily, and that's true. The classic psychedelics is also true. Very true of MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. It's really giving you a leg up, making it easier to do very, very difficult work going back to a trauma. Trying to digest it, process it, integrate it. So it's such an essential component of the treatment model. But one has to be realistic as well by saying, oh, integration lasts a lifetime. Well, people delivering a service can't be there for a lifetime. So what's the answer there? And people are wrestling with that issue right now. And I think one of the solutions might be that it's, in a sense, on you to appoint. The therapeutic team can treat you to a point and then it becomes what you might call practice. In a similar way, that meditation is a practice. It's something that you have to keep up. And if it slips, then things could slip. And that's the way it is. Or you have another psychedelic treatment. So people have even used this term of practice in relation to psychedelics, where there's a psychedelic practice like there's a meditation practice. But I'm using meditation intentionally here because they actually think that meditative practice, elements of spiritual practice could be a very important complement to psychedelic therapy. And I think it's probably doing something similar in terms of promoting an ability to sit with-- a former colleague of mine said it quite well. In relation to psychedelic therapy versus chronic pharmacotherapy or like SSRIs being on them all the time. Says psychedelic therapy allows you to sit with rather than sit on. And so that's quite good. Yeah. So the meditation, the mindfulness, the ability to, yes, be present-centered but also present-centered and accepting so if things come up, you can watch and process and then let go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That Holy Grail of mindfulness. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Awareness without reactivity, respond. I grew up in the Bay Area and you'd hear this language, right? And I'm not being disparaging this. I have friends that are on the board of Esalen and work down there. And I've gone there. And yet you hear these terms, right? Be responsive, not reactive, which to a neuroscientist is like grates on me, which probably just means I have issues. And surely, I do. But what does that mean? It's saying like, oh, to be the observer but not be drawn into the experience. And again, I don't want to be overly reductionist, but what I find so compelling about the emerging data, because it really is data, on psychedelics as treatments for depression and trauma, namely psilocybin and MDMA is that it really seems to allow people this space that is so commonly thrown around. Giving space between stimulus and reaction. Viktor Frankl talked about this. But I've been reading a wonderful book called The Prince of Medicine. Dates back to the origins of medicine. Very dense book. People have been talking about this stuff and thinking about this stuff for thousands of years. Psychedelics seem to give people access to that better version of self, which is remarkable. What's also remarkable, it's, perhaps, worth pointing out is that, five years ago, I never would have been comfortable having this conversation. I would have been afraid to lose my job. Stanford Magazine, this week, just published an entire issue about psychedelics with how ketamine works, MDMA, psilocybin with the appropriate cautionary notes in there. But clearly, times are changing. Speaking of which, I know you're doing a trial on first-time use of psychedelics. What inspired that? And what are you observing? And as you tell us that, please give us a few of the key contours. What's the dose, how old are these subjects? I'm assuming it's men, women. Are they suffering from depression or not? What's the landscape of that study? And I realize this is still early days of the study or maybe it's close to completion. It's not yet published, however, correct? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's not published, it's not submitted, it is completed. So this was another one of our COVID studies, in a sense, meaning COVID hit and we had to finish the study. And it was hard to finish the study because of COVID. That was true of our psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram. Lexapro trial, which is published in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: This was '20-- that paper, by the way, folks, we'll provide a link to in the show note captions as well as some of Robin's other papers. I think the 2022 New England Journal paper is really fabulous given the different dosages and the comparison to, essentially, what is microdosing and the comparison to citalopram. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. Yeah. That's interesting that you link the way we gave small doses of psilocybin to microdosing. We didn't think of it that way. We thought it was just a necessary placebo for the big dose, the 25 milligrams. Yeah. So that we could say to everyone we're giving you psilocybin and not be lying. Yeah. For those who got escitalopram, Lexapro for six weeks, they got a very, very low dose of psilocybin. But it allowed us to standardize all the psychotherapy and so on. But the other study that you're referring to was in healthy volunteers. Middle-aged. Average age, I think, was 40. So not your typical student study that is so often the case in psychology research. All the undergrads end up volunteering for your study. So this is more of an age range and also-- I think it was an equal proportion of male and female. All the staff actually were female, which the staff were very proud of them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although, it produces its own potential confound, right? To become all one sex of staff. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Possibly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: They did a good job in the sense that we saw significant improvements in well-being at the end of the trial. So let me describe the design. It was a repeated measures design, meaning people come in, you collect your baseline data and do a brain scan, and you give people a placebo. We gave people a placebo. And actually let me rewind a little bit. Everyone's healthy volunteers, middle-aged never taken a psychedelic in their life. None of them. Entirely fresh, virgin people coming in. And the plan is to give them their first ever psychedelic experience. So that's what we did in this study. But to do it, we have this repeated measures design where they'll first get a placebo. And we have the placebo so that we can do all the procedures, all the therapy, all the music listening but not give a whopping dose of psilocybin. Again, we gave them a placebo dose of psilocybin. 1 milligram. We stick EEG headsets on during the experience to record the brain activity from the scalp, the oscillating electrical activity. And we do the MRI scanning before and after to see deeper into the brain, and we can look at the functional connectivity that we were referring to earlier, and also properties of brain anatomy, which we did in this study. So the short story is that all of the changes that we saw both psychologically and neurobiologically were seen with the 25 milligrams. It all happened with that big whopping dose. And what did we see? Well, we did see significant improvements in psychological well-being. We saw what I call the entropic brain effect, which is actually formerly quite accurate. We see an increase in the informational complexity of ongoing brain activity recorded with the EEG on the dose of psilocybin. The activity becomes more complex. It's harder to predict across time. It's more informationally rich. And that effect correlates as it does very reliably with the magnitude of the subjective effect. So the bigger the trip, the bigger this entropic brain effect. Now, pretty well replicated finding. But then the MRI, seeing deep into the brain was probably our most exciting result where we didn't just see some functional brain changes, but we've seen some anatomical brain changes as well. And we used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging that looks at the cabling of the brain, the white matter tracts. And we saw a change in major tracts. So we limited our search space to really thick tracts. Really thick fibers. And the fibers that came through as changing were ones that traveled between the prefrontal cortex and the thalamus and the striatum. There were two tracks, two prefrontal tracks that changed. And they changed in the direction of a decrease in axial diffusivity, which could be interpreted as tract integrity where a decrease would be an increase in tract integrity. It is something that you see in the developing brain. The axial diffusivity decreases as the brain goes from being a baby to being an adult. Axial diffusivity goes down. And then in aging and pathologies of aging, axial diffusivity goes up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is in the opposite direction of the results you talked about earlier in terms of brain connectivity of increased communication across areas. If I understand correctly, and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong, by the way, that this decrease in axial diffusivity translates to a higher fidelity of communication between the prefrontal cortex and the thalamus and striatum as opposed to less. And your description of this as somewhat like the transition from babyhood and childhood to adulthood. Speaks to the same where we know that there's a massive culling of connections as opposed to growth of connections. So in other words, as we get older, we get better at doing certain things and less good at doing potentially most everything else. Is that right? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Ish. Because the change was anatomical and not functional. So the other stuff was is really measuring communication in the brain by looking at how the activity fluctuates across time and whether those fluctuations in activity are synchronous between regions. And if they are, we say they're functionally connected. And we infer that they're talking to each other, because they go up and down in synchrony. But when it comes to the anatomy, we're talking about the just static material stuff. And so we're seeing the fibers and a property of the fibers change. At least that's what we think. And recently, we had an independent person come in and reanalyze the data, because one of those things, incredible finding requires credible evidence, really strong evidence. And I would say, the evidence at the moment is one study. So we need to be cautious on that. But we did re-analyze it and use this correction procedure-free water correction to be more sure that it was a change in the actual microstructure rather than something to do with the extracellular space. The water surrounding the fibers. And it came through. In fact, the change was strengthened by doing this correction step. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this is neuroplasticity as the consequence of one first time session with 25 milligrams of psilocybin. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. So we're excited and the two-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Understandably so. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --the two different-- the second analyst coming in wasn't sure she believed it and then she thought this correction technique might kill the result and then it came through, and she's like, OK. Now, I'm excited too. So we'll see. We don't know what it means. What does it mean functionally? We don't know. How did the people change? Well, psychologically, as I said, well-being improved. We did look at their cognition, and we used a cognitive flexibility paradigm that looks at people's ability to notice a rule change and then flexibly adapt their behavior based on noticing this rule change and people improved after the 25 milligrams and didn't significantly improve after the placebo dose. There weren't correlations with the DTI change, the cabling change and these psychological outcomes. But with these studies and smaller sample sizes, you don't always see those correlations come through. So it's something. We don't know what it means. But it's a change in brain anatomy that's in the opposite direction to what you see in an aging brain or with pathology of aging. And it's what you see in a healthy brain as it goes from normal neurodevelopment into adulthood. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very, very exciting and intriguing. And I appreciate that you highlighted that it's just one study, although from everything you've said, it sounds like it's been done with immense rigor. So we will eagerly await the publication of that study so we can peruse all the data and the subsequent studies. I want to hear a bit about the study that you have been carrying out on the use of psilocybin for the treatment of fibromyalgia. I'm intrigued by fibromyalgia, because I have a good friend who also-- I won't reveal who it is. No. It's not me. This isn't the "I have a friend thing." Who also is a scientist who sits at a fairly high position in the National Institutes of Health who quietly has expressed to me that they are incredibly frustrated with the fact that the standard medical community has largely ignored fibromyalgia. And that for many years, it was lumped with things like chronic fatigue syndrome and other so-called-- again, so-called. I'm not saying this. But people often refer to these as, oh. It's psychosomatic. That's all in your head. Which, as a neuroscientist, is a ridiculous statement to hear, because it's all in your head. Your brain is in your head after all. Your physiology and your psychology are influencing each other. Of course. And the world is starting to appreciate that more. But first of all, maybe you could tell people what fibromyalgia is, what inspired you to do a study on fibromyalgia using psilocybin of all things because that's surprising to me. And if you are allowed to or if you have access to the data in mind, share with us a little bit about what you're discovering in that study. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure. Yeah. Happy to. So again, it's psilocybin therapy and the population is fibromyalgia syndrome. So this is people presenting with a generalized chronic pain. So unlike some other pain disorders where the pain is focused. You can say, it's my lower back, which is very common. Chronic lower back pain. This is more generalized. And for that reason, it's hard to know what it is. And that's why it's been a controversial space in medicine and it's been-- yeah. It's had that charge thrown at it that maybe it's psychosomatic, and just to your point, is anything ever independent of the mind, anyway. But this is actually a fascinating space for how subjective experience, the lived experience, and the mind can influence the body. Because there's some really interesting literature around the etiology. How the pain has come about. In a sense like what caused the pain. What's the story there? And the head of the trial, I would say to my colleagues, let's just be careful. Because there is some fascinating literature around things like a background of trauma and how that can relate to issues related to inflammation and how that can express into things like fibromyalgia syndrome. I just said, be very careful there, because if you go in with an assumption that there's some buried trauma, for example, then there's that whole other side of psychoanalysis that massively tripped it up around false memory and so on. And so please don't hold prior assumptions that you're going to uncover buried trauma in every case. Now, the team of treated, I think, eight people and it is going very well. Again, I just want to be careful with how I describe it to manage expectations and not get too carried away. But I check in with the team every week, and they're still based in London doing the work. And it's remarkable what I hear about the profound experiences that people have under the drug. In this study, we only give one dose. It's a very mechanistic study. We actually have the EEG cap on in the sessions like in the healthy volunteer study, but this time now taking it into a clinical population. And-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they are wearing an eye mask under the influence of 25 milligrams of psilocybin. Most of them probably have not done psilocybin before. So it's a little bit like the first time study in some sense. They have fibromyalgia that's debilitating in some way. They don't want it, obviously. And during the session, are they thinking about their pain? Are they being told to think about their pain? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: They're not being told to think about the pain. In fact, as I understand it, while there is a therapeutic model around acceptance of the pain, it isn't-- unlike some of the PTSD work, you aren't encouraging them to focus on the index trauma and then work through it and try and digest it. We don't do that with the pain. So the pain is there, but there isn't an invitation to focus on it. And that's probably one of the differences with classic psychedelic therapy versus MDMA therapy. Arguably, MDMA therapy is more like it's a bit closer to traditional talk therapy where there is more dialogue. People are able to talk on MDMA. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In the MDMA trials, do you know whether or not they used eye masks or-- because this seems to be an important distinction between, as you described, the therapeutic trip versus the trip that one does going into the woods and taking psilocybin in the woods or at a party or while staring at a poster or a leaf. Again, I'm not trying to trivialize those experiences. I mean, obviously, they can be profound. So I'm told. But the MDMA trials seem to involve, as you said, more directed dialogue. And sometimes, even empathic connection between people by they're actually looking at one another, the eyes and eye contact being such a key part of the human social cognitive connective networks. So do you know if they put eye masks on people during the therapeutic session? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I'm pretty sure that they have the eye masks there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Because a lot of the MDMA work, and I was part of an MDMA trial. Was, as I understand geared toward developing, because it's an empathogen empathy toward the self. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. I'm pretty sure they have the eye masks there, but they probably-- and it's a great question, because you could formally test this. It probably don't use them as much. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mhm. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: The thing is with the classic psychedelics, if you're looking at your guides or your facilitators and their faces are melting or-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: On MDMA, you just might really start to feel more connected to you. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. They might look especially beautiful and you know-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: sure. Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: And yeah. There's that fascinating effect of loving the people that you're with. And so yeah. I imagine they talk more and use the eye shades less. And it is more interpersonal rather than like intrapersonal or going inside. They do use a fascinating terminology that some people have critiqued, but it is a very interesting phenomenon. And it's this notion of the inner healer. They use that language a lot. It's been critiqued because it sounds very suggestive. You know? And that's probably one of the vehicles here. Driving the therapeutic process is suggestion. I think we have to be honest about that. So when they go inside, that's another term that we use very much in the classic psychedelic therapy work. You go inside. You put the eyeshades on, and people are encouraged to go inside. But when they do that in the MDMA work, especially, they might be told explicitly and listen to the inner healer and that language. So you could see how a cynic or a skeptic could come in and see that as some kind of like suggestive priming or biasing. I think they have a point. Skeptics often do, but I don't think it's all of the story. And just briefly, because it's an interesting point, speaking to that point a bit in our psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram trial, we measured pre-trial expectancy. And we did it for both conditions. So what kind of improvement do you expect with the Lexapro, the escitalopram at the end of the trial? And what kind of improvement if you go into the psilocybin arm and get two big doses of psilocybin. What kind of improvement do you think you'll see in that arm? And of course, it was a coin flip as to what arm people went into and there was no crossover. What we found was that it was true that we had a sample bias, so most people had higher expectation stations. On average, there were higher expectations for psilocybin and its efficacy or effectiveness versus the SSRI, the Lexapro. However, when we looked at the correlation or the predictive relationship between pre-trial expectancy and response, we saw that pre-trial expectancy for the escitalopram predicted response to escitalopram across virtually every single measure, all these different measures of depression and anxiety and well-being, and I think none of the scales. I'm pretty sure it was none of about 12 or so mental health rating scales. Was there a relationship between pre-trial expectancy? Even though it was high, it didn't predict-- pre-trial expectancy didn't predict response to the psilocybin therapy. So that was a bit of a smash on the head for the idea that the classic psychedelic therapy is some kind of placebo response. And I think it's so important to address that question. Because if it doesn't come through as it didn't come through, then it opens up even more intrigue about, well, what is it then? If it's not just a placebo response or a super placebo response like an amplification of the placebo response, then it must be something else. And how intriguing? It has a direct therapeutic action. It must be something. And we don't yet know what it is. I talked about the residual increase in global connectivity. That's one possibility. But the truth is, we're just scratching the surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet the therapeutic outcomes are, again, just so marvelously impressive. I'm curious as to why as-- well, there are that many labs. But the laboratories that are focused on classic psychedelics for the treatment of depression and now as you mentioned, promising results for anorexia and fibromyalgia as well. Although preliminary very promising. Why the lack of attention toward LSD? Is it that the LSD trips are just too long? Is it that they are qualitatively different? Are there any data on non-microdoses of LSD? And here I want to be very careful, because I learned through my interactions on social media that this term microdose is very misleading. And in some cases, can be dangerously misleading, because, as you mentioned earlier, the effective psychedelic dose or the-- effective meaning that can induce a real trip with hallucinations, et cetera, of LSD is actually in the microgram range. So some people hear microdose, and they think microgram of LSD is a-- micrograms is a microdose when, in fact, a macrodose of LSD can be measured in micrograms, right? So this is where in the absence of scientific training, people can really go astray. Or even just in lack of understanding of the metric system. And since now you're a recent arrival to the US, fortunate for us. Sorry. England's loss is the US's gain by-- Robbins Lab moved from England to the United States recently. So score 1 for us. But why isn't there more use of LSD in these trials? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I think it probably is the duration of the trip. It used to be stigma and it was easier to get your psilocybin study through, because others were, they were getting that through. So there was the likes of Franz Vollenweider in Zurich in Switzerland and then Roland Griffiths coming along and doing the psilocybin work at Hopkins. So you could appeal to that precedence and say, well, they're doing it over there. Can we not do it in little England? So that's how it worked for us. We did actually go on and do an LSD study once we'd laid the foundations for doing this kind of work. And it was a brain imaging study. It was a really extensive one actually where we used both MRI and another modality called MEG, sort of super EEG in a sense. But you know, why didn't that turn our heads to think, oh, should we not be doing our trials with LSD? It does have something to do with the pragmatics like a study day with psilocybin is long enough. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So four to six-hour trip? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And the FDA asked us to have the people in the lab until eight hours post-dose, which personally I think could be quite excessive, especially if it's a low dose. And if you have that in the placebo condition as well, it becomes impractical. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Scientists are not paid nearly enough to warrant the-- there's no such thing as overtime for the graduate students and postdocs. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. It's often those more junior members that are doing that really hard work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was described very well to me by a student when I was-- a graduate student said to me, they really can't afford to pay us by the hour. Because we used to work. He was a electrophysiologist, so he would run experiments. No joke, folks. Three to five-day experiments. Sleeping in bouts of two hours here or there in a dark room with a bunch of equipment and recordings. So these are long, long acute electrophysiological recordings. So yeah. No scientist does it for the money, I promise you. There is money in pharma, there is not money in personal income. It's not lucrative for the basic scientist. So yes. LSD is what? Anywhere from 8 to 15 hours, something like that. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. 15 would be a little long. You'd be a bit worried if you were still tripping at that time, maybe with a really big dose. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oops. No. Just kidding. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Eight hours plus-- and dose dependent, yeah. If it's a bigger dose, it's a longer experience. But if you're going to dose say, 10:00 AM in the morning, which is more or less how it often goes, then that's 6:00 PM still feeling the effects. And then how long do you wait now to close things out before they can go home. Even with psilocybin, you have people still at work into the evening. And the staff are always there later, of course, because they've got to pack up and yeah. So these are long days. And it's too much, you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: That makes sense. Practical constraints. I learned from a recent guest on this podcast that we recorded with, Dr. Satchin Panda who is a colleague of mine when I was down at the Salk Institute. Pioneered a lot of the studies on so-called intermittent fasting. That the reason that the eating period in these studies-- in animals and now on humans is 8 hours, the feeding window in these studies is because the graduate student was going to, otherwise, lose their relationship. Because their significant other says, listen, you can be in the lab for 12 hours, that meant some hours before the experiment, then 8 hours, and then some hours afterwards. But you can't stay in there longer. And many people use the eight-hour feeding window as a consequence. So the scientist has to exist and be carried out in real-world frame. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It does. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It does. ANDREW HUBERMAN: MDMA is a little bit shorter, right? It's about a four to-- it's also about four to six hours, correct? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. It's kind of similar to psilocybin. Yeah. It is. And actually, in the maps work, they redose after a certain point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The booster. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: They have a booster or optional booster, yeah. So there is that. And now, people are thinking, well, even the psilocybin sessions are long and expensive. And if you have to have two staff members there all the time, that's expensive. That's where most of the expense is. Is in the staffing. So can we abridge the experience, make it shorter, and get away with it, and get similar therapeutic outcomes? So there's a lot of interest in that direction. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May I ask about-- sorry to interrupt, but I want to make sure I don't forget to ask about combination psilocybin MDMA therapies. The reason I ask about this is-- and here, truly not me, but I know people who do self-administered combination psilocybin and MDMA. I think I heard this right. I think it's called a hippy flip. There's another one that involves LSD too. Again, I'm not suggesting people do these drug combinations. But the way it was described to me was that the psilocybin, because it's so serotonergic, sometimes can be not a downer but can have a bit of kind of a murky feel to it. Some real deep introspection, sometimes in the darker realms of one's psyche depressive thoughts, et cetera. Not that it necessarily stays that way throughout the trip, but that the MDMA, because it has a very strongly serotonergic but also dopaminergic-- I mean, it has an amphetamine component. Cocaine-like, in fact. If you've ever seen someone on MDMA, their pupils are about the size of a quarters. For a reason, they're extreme autonomic arousal compared to a sedative, which by the way, would constrict the pupils. So they describe the use of MDMA to balance out the affect component of it. What are your thoughts on combination psilocybin MDMA? Does this hold any therapeutic potential? This is, obviously, backyard chemistry in the sense that people are cowboying this stuff on their own, which again, I don't really recommend. I'd like to see the science go first, but I understand this is how it works in the real world. Yeah. What are your thoughts on combining compounds? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Well, I guess, they're cowboying it in recreational context, but also underground therapists do work with this combo. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's what I'm referring to. So I'm not talking about people partying with this stuff. I'm talking about there are thousands now of therapists that offer psychedelic therapies illegally, really, because it's not legal at least, not in the US, to possess or sell. But that are doing this. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's really why I'm asking. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And I think there's something to be said for-- one has to be careful with this as a scientist. But if they're doing it, are they using some kind of trial and error? The same is true, of course, with longer history of psychedelic plant medicine use if by plants, we include the fungi as well. So in the extended sense plants. There will have been trial and error there. It might not be as systematic as the science we do today, but maybe there's been a learning process. And maybe what they do, they've come to because they found it works. So by that principle, I'm interested in that combination and whether it does offer some advantages, maybe, in certain patients. One of the buzz terms in medicine these days is precision medicine. A precision medicine and personalized medicine. So maybe there are certain cases where introducing say, psilocybin after the MDMA or the other way around could offer some advantages. And the differences are interesting. Psilocybin can get you to deep places. Maybe the kernel of your suffering and major life experiences and complexes that are causally linked to whatever the pathology that you're presenting with. But it can do it, sometimes, quite aggressively. And if it say, post-traumatic stress disorder, it can be overwhelming. And you can fight it. And really, it's that. The resistance is really challenged, and they fight back. And the therapeutic breakthrough and the progress isn't happening because you've agitated the defense mechanisms. Whereas what MDMA offers is something arguably more directionally reliable in terms of the valence. It's more directionally positive generally, an MDMA experience. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hard to have a bad time on MDMA. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: To be quite blunt, I mean. But one of the concerns I had with MDMA, I've never done it recreationally. I have had not and have not ever done it recreationally. But when it was done in this therapeutic setting, I realized, because there was a music on at the beginning, I actually asked them to turn it off, because I realized that the music was becoming such an attractor to my attention that I suddenly was starting to think about music and my love of music, which was not the focus of the session that was there for. And I'm glad that they did turn the music off, because the moment they did, I was able to drop in within the eye mask to this sort of go inward and address some certain issues that at least to me felt key and productive. So that seems to be the kind of hazard with MDMA. Is that it's such an empathogen that one could start to-- you could go down any number of different rabbit holes. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. But it's also-- it's a strength, because you well, the classics like psilocybin can take you there very reliably but maybe a bit aggressively. MDMA makes it easier to go there. And that's its strength. And that's why that marriage of MDMA therapy for PTSD, in particular, is a good combo. It works, because you are going to go there. In a sense, you have to really make the therapeutic progress. You're going to have to go back there. But we're going to set it up so that you can go back there and feel safer and more trusting and be able to go back there whereas you've never, otherwise, been able to go back there without dissociating or having horrible flashbacks and so on. So that's the strength that it offers. I guess the limitation would be that, maybe, it doesn't take you as deep as the classic psychedelics. And I tend to think I'm biased on this one, that there's a kind of honesty to the classics in that it is hell as well as heaven. And that's the psyche. It isn't all roses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I really appreciate that you bring that up. Because I think that there's such a fear of so-called bad trips. There's such a fear in non-psychedelic states to avoid the painful and everything we know from trauma and the treatment of trauma. And we've had several guests on here. And my close colleague, close, close colleague at Stanford, Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatries, Clinical Hypnotist. Amazing human being and scientist and clinician, has really just embedded this in my mind. That the only way to deal with trauma is to get right up next to that trauma to the point where some relief is experienced. There is no other real way. And so, I really appreciate that you're saying that the classic psychedelics may offer with a very strong nudge, perhaps, the opportunity to get into the uncomfortable in a way that MDMA or some non-classical psychedelics, perhaps, do not. We were talking about time frames or duration of trips and these different compounds and how they differ and how they're similar. I'd love for you to educate me on DMT and some of the work that you're doing with DMT. My understanding is that it's a very brief trip minutes. People I know who have done this. Again, therapeutically, actually, I'll just point to one very exciting, I think, group and initiative which is the Veterans Solutions Initiative, which is a group-- this is carried out in Mexico, but in conjunction with laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere who are evaluating the neural changes. And this involves ibogaine, which is iboga, which is a very long duration psychedelic. 22 hours or more, followed by I think one or two doses of DMT. This is for veterans to deal with any number of issues. Appears to be working with great success. And I've spoken to several people who've gone through this. And the way that they described DMT, almost across the board, was quote, here I'm just pulling quotes, right? Anecdata. The most profound experience of my entire life, even greater than the birth of my children, quote, "like being attached to the shockwave of an atom bomb." Quote. "There's no way I would do another dose, because the first one was so unbelievable." Interesting, by the way. I think most of us, including me, would think, why wouldn't you want to do it again then? But this idea that that was just beyond anything. So these are significant-- excuse me these are significant statements coming from individuals who have existed at the extremes of human experience to begin with. These are so-called tier 1 operators within special operations who exit and may or may not have trauma. But DMT sounds like a big deal. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Short duration, really big deal. What do we know about its chemistry? What do we know about how it's impacting brain networks? And what in the world is going on that people are describing it as the ways I just mentioned a few moments ago? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. It's a rocket ship. If the psilocybin is like a ship leaving port, then yeah. This is a rocket ship into craziness. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it serotonin 2A? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It is. Yeah. So it is a classic psychedelic. It's a direct agonist, a direct stimulator of the serotonin 2A receptor. It's an order of magnitude less potent than psilocybin. But potency is a funny thing, because it's dose-dependent. So that doesn't mean that the experience with DMT is less than that of psilocybin. It's just that you give more of the drug. But that's matched by it's stickiness for the serotonin 2A receptor, which is this kind of golden rule in psychedelic sciences that it was discovered in the mid 1980s. This tight relationship between the affinity or the stickiness or the binding potential of a psychedelic for 2A receptor, in particular. Serotonin 2A and its potency. And the stickier the drug, the more potent. So LSD really sticky. Very, very potent. You only need those tiny microgram doses. So DMT, by its affinity, is a little less potent, but by its effects when you give a standard dose, it's just wild. And DMT, because there's another compound called 5-methoxy DMT, which is a bit different pharmacologically and subjectively, it's similar in terms of its kinetics. It's another rocket ship. Both compounds in the wild, so to speak, are smoked often. DMT and 5-MeO. People are vaping both actually now. There are vape pens that are being developed for people to administer this, but more traditionally, it's been a smoking thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is clinically not recreationally or both. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Both no. I mean, underground practitioners are using the vape pens. They like them because people titrate the dosage. They get a feel for what it is to be going into this state so that they feel they can let go and go into it. And actually, I think some of the veterans work might be giving 5-MeO after the ibogaine. Phenomenologically, if there's a difference between DMT and 5-MeO, people might put it on 5-MeO being more of a reliable ego dissolution experience. Less visual and more all round immersion in the greater whole loss of self-identity and just immersion in everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Maybe we could just talk about ego dissolution for a second, because it's such a sticky, interesting idea. I can take a step back as a neuroscientist and say, OK. Ego dissolution. This idea that-- from a very early age, we have a concept of self and that I wake up every morning and I know I'm me and not somebody else. And presumably, you do the same. And most people do the same, I would hope. And that there are objects in the world and people in the world beyond us. But every time I hear about ego dissolution, it sounds like it's kind of a temporary elimination of the idea that things start and stop between us and everything else. Almost like in a kind of a-- here I'm not trying to sound philosophical or metaphysical, but there's the molecular continuity of life, right? We're all just little bits-- ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Which is true. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is true, right? Not a functional way to go through the day, right? Because you want to make a cup of coffee, you don't really want to get lost in that if your goal is to make a cup of coffee. But what is the power of ego dissolution? Is it the idea that we belong, is it a sense of meaning? Is it the sense that we're not as important as we think, which, of course, could be a wonderfully useful way to go through life? To think that we're not as-- like we are vitally important, but we're not the only thing, right? Because I do believe connection is vital as most people do. What is ego dissolution? And why would this serotonin 2A activation cause that? That's remarkable. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Great questions. I mean, what is it? You alluded to it with the start/stop, I think. Because you could define it by boundaries. In a sense what isn't me is as valid here as the a developing sense of what is me that a child develops at whatever age. And so a major characteristic of the ego dissolution experience rather than just a negative, a thing going away. My sense of self going away is the positive. Oh. Now, I feel interconnected with other people and the world at large. And I realize that there is that molecular continuity. And actually, that's a ground truth. And oh, maybe the ego thing is somewhat illusory or at least a construction of my mind. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And indeed it is, right? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, it is. Yeah. I mean, there's no transcendentalism about that. It's just not like logic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think we are about it a little bit like family. I mean, we all know what immediate family is, but it's like-- forgive me for interrupting myself. I do it all the time, anyway. When I teach neuroanatomy, some clever student always figures out, OK. Well, that's connected to that and that's connected. But ultimately, everything in the brain is connected to everything else. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's just no way around that. That's a true statement. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so you really just have to decide where you draw the boundaries between-- ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Where do you draw the line? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Where are the modules? What are the modules? You could say, the brain is just one big macro module. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And then you also want to include the body. And now fortunately, people are starting to embrace this idea that it's not mind-body, it's both. Because the nervous system extends through both, of course. So the same could be said of family. We're related, right? Not just by virtue of the fact that we're human beings. If we did our genealogical charts, we would find a convergence at some point. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And of course, this becomes a bit of a game. But then one realizes that where you draw the boundaries and if you draw them at brother, sister, parents, biological parents, et cetera, that's a game too. And so it is just a construct. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. I mean, it is a fun game. Where do you draw the line and when to pass and when to collapse. It's also a classic consideration in science when to pass and when-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That lumper versus the splitter. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: There you go. It's brilliant. Yeah. But you asked this question, like, well, why does psychedelics do it? And there, we think psychedelics do it, because the target receptors, at least, classic psychedelics do it. And that's important to stress. So MDMA doesn't really do it in the same way, might soften the ego a bit. But yeah. That's debatable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My experience with MDMA is that it's such a strong empathogen. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that it can cause empathy for others. Certainly, you could imagine situations where one in MDMA journey and afterwards says, oh, my oppressors are the people that harmed me. And here I'm not referring to my experience. But they did the best with what they have. Actually have empathy for them. Forgiveness. But also for oneself. That there's an empathy for self, I know I said this earlier, that is very hard for most people to access. Perhaps, not the narcissists out there listening. They'll be like, of course, empathy for self. But everyone else, I think, all the other healthy people or the healthy people other than narcissists and not picking on narcissists. I have to imagine they suffer too. In fact, I think that's the root of their narcissism. That empathy for self is not something that comes reflexively for most people. And here I'm not talking about self love or self respect. But this notion of being able to see the self as not just deserving of love and care but actually holding that in place while in confrontation with something challenging in a way that allows a more, not less access to adaptive responses to that challenge. I think that's the way I conceptualize it. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, drugs offer a great-- they offer great-- they are great scientific tools for tackling this question. What is ego dissolution, and why do drugs modulate it? And what does that tell you about the brain? Because other drugs like cocaine releasing more of a different neurotransmitter, dopamine more than serotonin. The opposite is the case with MDMA. Is more of an ego inflator, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely. People will become hyper-linear, hyper-linked to their own desires and wishes, and future outcomes become an obsession. It's the stuff of American Psycho and the cliches and stereotypes of the '80s cocaine culture. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. We did a study once actually looking at dose-dependent relationship with ego inflation on one axis and ego dissolution on the other and saw that it just massively passed or differentiated between cocaine and psychedelics. It's quite a neat study. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So cocaine makes people's egos super inflated? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And doesn't touch dissolution and the opposite is the case with psychedelics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there any neuroimaging to explain how cocaine does that? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: That would be a great study. Yeah. Great idea. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We should do that. I have a sabbatical coming up. I've got 12 months of sabbatical coming up. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. That's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm going to show up in your lab. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. That's a really good one. If it's all right to finish the thread on why psychedelics and ego dissolution, we do know some things or we have some hypotheses. And it's that the target receptors, the serotonin 2A receptors that classic psychedelics hit, are heavily expressed in what these days I like to call recent brain. Because evolutionarily, it's recent brain. It's cortex that humans have more than any other species. If you look at a mapping of cortical expansion from say, macaque or chimp to human, it's the very same map that you'll find the 2A receptors in. So that's the target. And it's just easy to think that-- oh, well, that could be the egoic brain and the classic psychedelics come in. They scramble up the activity. That's the entropic brain action. And in terms of the start/stop, the boundaries, that entropic action spreads out the system. It doesn't shut it off. It spreads it out. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Dissolution? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And you were talking about the headspace as well. So that fits. If it's more capacious, it fits. The big qualifier with psychedelic therapy that people rightly bring up is it doesn't last. That's the paradox of it. The paradox of ego dissolution. So the ego might go away during the trip, and you have these profound insights about the molecular continuity and how we're all one and interconnected. And then you come down, and however long later, the ego comes back, but maybe with a vengeance. And sadly, things can go awry when people haven't done the work. Perhaps haven't done the integration work and maybe ego defenses come back and it's not a pretty picture. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How often do you see that in the trials that you do? What percentage of people coming through do you think end up with worse than they were before the trial? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's very rare in the trials that we've done. Yeah. But you see defenses come back. So you do see people relapse. That's more-- if you're pushing out to like three months plus in something like treatment resistant depression, that's more the rule than the exception sadly. People relapse. If their histories are histories of chronic depression, then while you might give them a window of wellness, sadly, it doesn't last. That's not to say that it doesn't ever last. It does. And we have people who are in our first treatment resistant depression trial who are well to my knowledge today, back at work doing fantastically well. But sadly, the majority have relapsed, to my knowledge. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And need to do more psychedelic journeys. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Well, they can't, because it's illegal. That's been the really difficult situation that we've been up against. Is that we do a trial where all of a sudden this schedule 1 drug becomes a medicine in the trial, or at least an experimental medicine. We give the treatment, it works fantastically well, gives people a remission that they've never really had for however long, and then the trial ends and they're denied that treatment. And worse still, if they were to have that treatment, they would be committing a crime. It's a sick joke in a way. But that's the situation that we've been in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that's a perfect segue for what I want to talk about now, which is, what is the current state of legality in terms of-- or the progression towards legality. I'd also like to touch on the role of, let's just say, incoming big pharma. There are a lot of start up companies now trying to capitalize on these discoveries that you and others have made. The landscape out there is very unclear to me. Maybe I'll just call out some silos as I see them and maybe we can draw some bridges between them, if they exist. At the ground level, not the grassroots, but at the ground level, I look to laboratories like yours, Matthew Johnson's, Roland Griffith's some laboratories at Stanford. Nolan Williams. Laboratories studying the effects of psychedelics in human beings, so not animal models, in terms of their clinical application for the treatment of depression, anorexia. I now know fibromyalgia, trauma. Let's lump MDMA in there as well, assuming that it all works in equivalent way at the level of where the legislature is taking things. OK. So labs using government money, philanthropy, et cetera. Then there are the therapists out there that are accessing what we believe are clean sources of MDMA. Psilocybin, LSD to do this. They are doing it illegally. This is in the US or other Western European countries, because, obviously, it's going to differ by country. Who are administering these things on the basis of what they're reading in these studies that you all are publishing. But also expanding on and experimenting hippie flips and combination drugs and ketamine and et cetera. But let's leave ketamine out right now because it's legal. But there's that. Then there's the-- I don't want to say recreational/open market, black market. And here I want to raise a flag to the fact that Dr. Peter Attia did a terrific podcast on this recently in his own podcast, The Drive. The fact that fentanyl-- lacing with fentanyl is now showing up in MDMA and psychedelics that are purchased on the street. So serious caution to those getting it from uncertain sources. And then you've got pharma. And then as an umbrella for all of this, you've got the FDA and law enforcement agencies, which currently say, this stuff is illegal unless it's being used in a clinical trial. Selling it or possessing it can get you charged with a crime ranging from-- I don't want to say because I don't know. But up to felonies. Right years in prison. So can't take it through airports, don't get caught with it, don't buy it, don't sell it kind of thing. So where are we going from that picture of the silos? I know things are in clinical trials now. Most people, including myself, are not familiar with how the different phases relate to the proximity to legality. Could you just give us the landscape and touch on how long you think it will be before the people that come through your trials could then go get a prescription for psilocybin or potentially buy it without the risk from a reliable source, one would hope, but without the risk of getting thrown in jail. I used to live in Oakland, California. My understanding-- and please correct me if I'm wrong, folks. Don't trust this information and get in trouble. My understanding is that psilocybin is decriminalized in Oakland, but that's not the same as being legal. So what is going on out there? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. Wow. Well, so much. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. I just asked 55 questions. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But feel free to answer just a subset of them if you like. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. Well, Oakland's a funny one. I live close to Oakland. There are head shops in Oakland that might be selling cannabis and cannabis-related paraphernalia that are selling mushrooms as well. Psilocybin, mushrooms-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a fact. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --openly. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a fact. I can verify that. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: OK. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I haven't purchased them, but I've gone in and checked it out, what's going on here. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. So the police aren't going to prioritize that activity, the purchasing of those mushrooms as a crime now in Oakland because of the decriminalization. So those head shops shouldn't strictly be selling. Well, they shouldn't be selling. They won't have a license to be selling. Licenses don't exist yet for that here. But let's see whether they get shut down. They probably will, I don't know. But there's a church in Oakland sort of say that they're selling and it's part of religious rights. They're using that church model as a loophole, the way that Native Americans can use peyote and they have a more genuine case, I think. Because there is a history there. But they're trying to kind of piggyback on that. Anyway, that's close to where we are right now. But federally, which is really the major inflection point, is the FDA and the licensing of psychedelics as medicines to be legally prescribed across the country, across the US and beyond, that is close because the key phase-- so there are different phases of clinical trials, and the key one to know about is phase III. Phase III trials are licensing trials. If they're successful, and typically you have to do at least two successful ones, show the results to the regulators who are the FDA, the medicine regulators, and say, is this good enough now for you to give me a license so that I can sell and provide this medicine that we've demonstrated is a medicine. So that work has been done with MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. MAPS have led that work and done two phase III trials. I think they've already publicly announced that the second trial had results consistent with the first. We know the results of the first, because they're published and they were remarkably good. Something like 67% remission rates. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And long term. My understanding is some of those remission rates for trauma were years, which is different than what you're describing for psilocybin, where people might need ongoing dosing. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But of course, just for trauma in those trials. My understanding is those MDMA trials were not focused on depression. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yes. Yes. Focused on the trauma. So that's something, because that data is being filed now, to my knowledge, like as we speak. And they're anticipating a decision maybe this year with rollout happening as early as next year. I mean, that's best case, I think. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask you when you, when you say rollout, and it's the appropriate term for MDMA, because of so-called rolling. About 20% of my audience, maybe 50 will understand that not funny joke that I made. Who's going to roll it out? Where would one get the clean source of MDMA, meaning not laced with fentanyl, not laced with methamphetamine, not undergone any chemical conversion to some other drug which can happen with extended shelf life, et cetera. Are people going to go to their psychiatrist to get MDMA? And who's going to be providing it? Is it going to be some big major pharma? This seems like a serious set of issues. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Mhm. It is. And I don't have all the answers. I do know that MAPS would be providing, because they've done the work and they have set themselves up in a sense to potentially become the provider, whether as a pharma company, which is the big question they're wrestling with at the moment. It's very expensive to become a pharma company. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet they probably deserve to make the choice, because they've put in so many years of hard work when all of this stuff was considered like raver culture party drug, they were the ones that spotted the therapeutic potential. I mean, we knew there was therapeutic potential based on work going back many decades, but points to them, and I think in my opinion, they should have the agency to make those decisions. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. And it's such a remarkable thing that's been achieved. And I think they've done it all on philanthropic donations. I think so. Yeah. So there is this big question mark. And the FDA are also asking questions about, to your question, who can provide this, because in the phase III work and up until this point, there's been a MAPS training, a MAPS therapist training. And you have to do this formal training in order to be a practitioner within the trials. But now, there's a question from the FDA whether that MAPS training can be the training that a clinician has to have to now be a provider. And when I say rollout, it's like offering this as a service, essentially. And so where would the referral come from? That's a good question. That I'm not 100% on the answer. Whether it would have to come from a psychiatrist or whether someone's-- sort of general physician could do that referral. But they will be going to a provider who is licensed and certified and will have done some training. And there will be a consensus on what constitutes good enough training to provide. There will also be some stipulations on the basic underlying professionalism of the clinician who provides. So I imagine, they'll have to be a mental health professional. I don't think they would have to necessarily be a psychiatrist, they could be, I think, a clinical psychologist. For all the dosings, I think without question, there would have to be a physician present or at least within ready access in case of an emergency. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, especially, with MDMA because of the propensity for cardiac issues. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because of the amphetamine properties. And where is psilocybin in terms of the phase trials? Is it in phase II, phase III? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It's in phase III. There's psilocybin therapy work being done for treatment resistant depression by a company called Compass. Those trials which are always multi-site. So there's always a bunch of teams or labs in a sense. Geographically spread out that are each contributing to data that then gets matched together and is then submitted as part of the phase III trial results. So that's happening with Compass right now. It's psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Those trials have just started and I think the earliest estimate that I heard in a journalistic article was because I don't think Compass would say or they wouldn't say publicly something like 2026. ANDREW HUBERMAN: '26. Wow. So MDMA is ahead of psilocybin. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's quite a few years ahead. And it's more of, not a certainty but it's very, very strong position with MDMA. Whereas the work's only just begun with psilocybin in terms of the phase III trials. But then you have this other situation of however many psychedelic research centers there are now across the globe, we had the first one in London in 2019. The first one in 2019, it's 2023 now, and I don't know how many there are. But so much has happened in such a small space of time. Yes. But all these different indications I've been able to tell you about-- anorexia and fibromyalgia syndrome. Trying to do a trial with a colleague of mine at UCSF in methamphetamine use disorder. He's got a trial going on in Parkinson's disease and chronic lower back pain and bipolar disorder. I mean, there's so much going on. OCD. Almost the full gamut of psychiatric disorders. Not schizophrenia, to my knowledge, are being looked at. So there's so much groundswell of activity. And I think these small investigator-led studies, typically, they're small because trials are expensive, are going to be reporting positive results. I know what we're seeing. And it will be four-- let's see now, at least four trials all with really positive results in very difficult-to-treat disorders. And that's just us. And I know there's so much elsewhere. Addiction disorders as well. Mike Johnson's work, obviously, Michael Bogenschutz. So all this compelling groundswell, it's really something. And yet the system to really make a big breakthrough in terms of licensing is, of course, slow. And that can frustrate people, but it has to be done properly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Else we revert back to what happened in the '70s where there was a lot of interest in psychedelics. It's interesting to me. There was a close juxtaposition of meditation and behavioral approaches to self-directed state change and psychedelics. Meditation made it through the hatch. I mean, there were some years where it was considered counterculture woo magic carpet weirdo stuff by Western science. But now, I mean, there are-- probably tens of thousands is not an overstatement of quality studies exploring how meditation can provide advantages for the mind and even for mental health. And psychedelics are now catching up, but they used to be close cousins in the cultural framework. But the problem was, I think, psychedelics were viewed as making people crazy. And university professors lost their jobs for having discussions like the one that you and I are having right now. And some people went to jail, but mostly people either left academic institutions or lost their jobs, whereas now these are some of-- these studies of the sort that you are doing and that are taking place at Stanford and Hopkins and elsewhere are some of the greatest magnetic pull for philanthropy for universities. Donors are very interested in supporting these sorts of studies, because they and their family members and people they know suffer from psychiatric illness for which the current big pharma approaches simply have not worked. So it's interesting to me that what once was seen as poison is now being viewed as a potential therapeutic. It's not just interesting, hopefully, it speaks to the evolution of the human species. People seem to be coming more open-minded about becoming more open-minded. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Right. Yeah. That's a good one. Yeah. And yet-- yeah. There's so much that's happening so fast. And there are elements of-- it's complexifying the space. There is critique, there's been some bad practice in psychedelic therapy, boundary crossing issues that have caused some scandals. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's too bad. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Isn't it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, I think too the gene therapy, right? It just takes one bad incident. Gene therapy was on a fast track three decades ago and then sadly, a child died in a gene therapy trial. And it's like shut down gene therapy practically for half a decade and then it slowly started ratcheting up again. Gene therapy broadly defined, and now we're in the age of potential directed gene therapy using CRISPR and things of that sort, which makes some people cringe and other people very excited. If you have Huntington's in your family, CRISPR is like the most exciting technology ever, because you could potentially eliminate it from your family line going forward, of course. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So I just really hope that we can be balanced as this all plays out. Because it could go similar way given the stigma, given the history that people would be very twitchy with some isolated incidents. And overgeneralize them, perhaps, in a sense, shining a light on them, I think, is important that has happened recently is important, because it really drills home how important it is that this work be done right and what the necessary safeguards and standards should be. Yeah. And it won't be an easy road forwards. But let's hope-- we've got to hope that it succeeds, because current treatments-- people talk about the mental health crisis and to your point earlier about anorexia rates, it's not always actually the case when you look at the epidemiology. When you look at the data that you see a big inflection in diagnoses or cases of psychiatric illness. I would say, it's more-- the treatments haven't moved. They haven't really progressed. They haven't got any better since the 1950s more or less. And new drugs have been more of the same. So there haven't been any paradigm shifts. And that's why I get a little impassioned when I talk about psychedelic therapy and that point that this is something different. It's not a drug every day. That system, it's not cutting it. Do we really want to keep on with that system? Sure. Not everyone will want to trip. And that will terrify some people so much that they'll just want to be on their Lexapro or a non-psychedelic, psychedelic, or whatever. And of course, it should be allowed to have those options. Of course. And the more options, the better. But I think there is great value in really understanding what psychedelic therapy is. And I think when you do, you realize that it is a major paradigm challenge on many levels. And the fact that it's different might be its greatest appeal at the moment, I think. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I am certainly grateful for your passion for the potential for psychedelics to be added to the array of potential treatments. And I really also appreciate how much you put it in there alongside the other treatments. Maybe even in combination with other treatments as opposed to saying, this is the thing that's going to cure everything. And yet the passion that you have for this potential paradigm shift, the one that really appears to be happening at the level of clinical data now is so important. So I want to extend a voice of gratitude for that and for the work that you're doing. I mean, I've been outside of this field, but as a neuroscientist, I've been paying careful attention to it really for the last five, seven years or so. And it's abundantly clear that it is a small group of individuals who are really thinking in terms of how the system works now and what needs to be done in order to change the system for the better like yourself that are really the driving force behind this new movement or paradigm shift. That without question, is going to lead to improvements in mental health and physical health outcomes. So I just want to say thank you for that. Also thank you so much for joining us today to share this immense knowledge set about the history of psychedelics. What they are, what they aren't. Their clinical applications as seen in your laboratory and other laboratories. I'm sure people already notice this, but you're incredibly generous in terms of attribution and also in your caution about explaining how some of the results in particular, on anorexia, fibromyalgia, are perhaps preliminary but very exciting. They're not published yet, anyway. We wouldn't call them preliminary. And also for touching on mechanism. That is not just about people feel better, but pointed to some potential underlying mechanisms in terms of connectivity changes and on and on. So thank you so much for your time today. Thank you for the work that you're doing. And thank you for the work that is sure to continue. We will provide links to studies in your laboratory, links to your laboratory so people can learn more and support in the ways that they deem appropriate for them. But just thank you, thank you, thank you. Such important work you're doing, Robin. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Thank you, Andrew. It's been a pleasure.

Title: Dr. Susanna Søberg: How to Use Cold & Heat Exposure to Improve Your Health | Huberman Lab Podcast
Published: 2023-05-15 12:00:46 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Susanna Søberg, PhD. She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, researching the effects of deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold or sauna can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones, and decrease inflammation. Dr. Søberg discusses how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which enhance energy, mood, and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas, and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Susanna soberg Dr Susanna soberg completed her doctoral thesis work at the center of inflammation and metabolism and the center for physical activity research at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark her research has focused on how deliberate cold exposure and deliberate heat exposure can be used to enhance human metabolism she is the first author of a seminal study which discovered the minimum thresholds for deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure for increasing Brown fat thermogenesis which is essentially a mode of increasing heat production and Metabolism in the body and for establishing actionable protocols that can be used outside of the laboratory to improve metabolism and human health Dr sog's research was published in the journal reports metabolism in 2021 adding to a long and important history of research focusing on the role of cold and the role of heat in altering various aspects of the body's physiology including Hormone Health metabolism and changes in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and epinephrine in fact today's discussion with Dr soberg focuses on the role of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure on metabolism but it also includes discussion of the effects of cold and heat on things like neurotransmitter production namely dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine the so-call catacol amines which strongly impact mood and Metabolism in addition Dr soberg answers many common questions about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure including for instance the difference between cold showers versus cold immersion up to the neck versus total body cold immersion including whether or not going back and forth between heat and cold changes fundamentally the way that heat and cold impact the metabolism hormones and neurotransmitter production ction and we talk about almost every single nuance and variation on deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure protocols as it relates to the underlying science in particular how cold receptors at the level of the skin are impacted versus cold reception and perception at the level of the brain and how all of that impacts systems of the brain and body relating to mental health physical health and Performance Based on her scientific research and academic training as well as her understanding and use of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure protocols Dr soberg is considered one of the world's leading experts on these topics in fact she is the author of a recent book entitled winter swimming which is I have to say a terrific book because it breaks down chapter by chapter the different aspects of deliberate heat and deliberate cold into its various constituent Parts including cold acclimation the cold shock response dangers and safeties of cold water the impact of cold and impact of heat on various aspect aspects of human health as well as specifics relating to Sauna versus Ice versus cold swimming showers Etc it's a very thorough read and a very easy and accessible read that if you are interested in deliberate cold or deliberate heat exposure or both will allow you to embrace those protocols with the greatest degree of confidence that you're going to obtain the specific end points that you're interested in and to do so safely before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is ever part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is plunge plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile atome self-cooling cold plunge for deliberate cold exposure I've talked numerous times on this podcast about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure and indeed today's episode is focused entirely on the benefits and the science of deliberate cold exposure Plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration and sanitation unit to give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want as we will discuss during today's episode with Dr Susanna soberg deliberate cold exposure especially deliberate cold exposure done up to the neck in water can be used to achieve a number of important end points related to mental health physical health and performance I've been using a plunge for more than two years now I can tell you that it makes it very easy to get your deliberate cold exposure at home it doesn't require much cleaning in fact it's very easy to keep clean which is essential you don't want bacteria and other things growing in your Cal plunge basically everything about the plunge is made easy so that anyone including myself can get their deliberate cold exposure on a regular basis at home if you're interested in getting a plunge you can go to plunge spelled p l u n ge.com huberman and get $150 off your cold plunge again that's plunge. comom huberman for $150 off today's episode is also brought To Us by Maui Nei venison which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available Maui Nei spent nearly a decade building a USDA certified wild harvesting system to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui the solution they built turns the proliferation of an invasive species into a wide range of nutrients Den products from butcher cuts and organ Meats to bone broth and jerky their bone broth has an unmatch 25 grams of protein per 100 calories several guests on this podcast who are experts in nutrition have pointed to the value of getting at least one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight each day with Maui Nei that's

thank you so great to have you here I feel like I should give a little bit of the backstory of how we got connected which was that for many years I've been interested in cold thermogenesis it was the topic of my senior thesis in college and I've of course followed the uh popularity of whm Hoff and we've had Dr Craig heler my colleague from biology department at Stanford who works on cold and its impact on physiology and sports performance so for a long time I've been interested in this area but there's been a real uh lack of new let's say high-profile quality scientific information in terms of how for instance cold plunges and sauna how that impacts human physiology I know there's been some information out there but it's been sort of scattered and then a little over a year ago I see this paper in cellreports medicine and was immediately struck the first of all the fact that it was in cell reports medicine I've been on the cell press editorial board for a long time now so press journals are of course phenomenal journals and the title and the content of the paper was directly in line with the sorts of practices that people are very curious about and then are starting to emerge things like sauna cold plunges and there was your name first on the author list and I reached out to you through social media and we've done a little bit of live content there together and I've been tracking what you've been doing in the world in terms of your book and talking about the results in your manuscript and talking about the science and impact of deliberate cold exposure and SAA and I have to say that it's been a wonderful and remarkable thing to see and you're bringing so much quality information about this area that for a long time I think was kind of Niche and is now becoming more and more mainstream so I'm going to start off with a thank you for being here and a thank you for the work that you've done and I'm looking forward to talking to you about it today so my first question um to get things started is what is happening when we get into an uncomfortably cold environment so for instance if I'm really hot on a hot day jumping into a cold pool feels really good but if I'm already kind of uh at room temperature I'm a little bit chilly getting into that same temperature of water doesn't feel so good right there's a shock there so if you could just walk us through what happens when we get into uncomfortably cold water whether or not it's by way of shower or cold Plunge at the level of our physiology and if you'd like our psychology I think that's a good place for us to start because I think it will Orient people to their own experience if they do that and for those that haven't done it um might start to peel back some of the the layers as to what the underlying mechanisms of cold are yeah thank you for that question it's really good to just address what actually happens in our physiology when we get cold and you can get cold in many ways so you can just head out for the one that gives you the most potent stressor which is submerging into cold water and but you could also go in outside in the cold wind that's also going to activate your um your sympathetic nervous system so get all these neurotransmitter going in your body and so your your catac colam mines um let's just address that we are taking a cold plch for example so if you are very hot for example um before you go into the cold water it's going to feel less it's going to feel less stressful but the the temperature a difference from your skin to the cold is definitely going to give you a a shock but your core temperature is warmer and that's going to feel a little bit better so that's why when people go into sauna for example and go out then in into the cold water they they they can do it easily easier than if they were cold beforehand could I just um ask you a few questions so you you mentioned the sympathetic nervous system which for um people listening who aren't familiar with that is the the branch of our nervous system that's responsible for creating accelerations in heart rate um feelings of alertness it's accompanied with stress and the stress response but it's accompanied with waking up in the morning for that matter so it's not always about stress and then you mentioned the catacol meines which um are dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine so maybe a little bit later we'll talk about those individual neurotransmitters but you raised a really important point which is something I get asked about a lot for people that are curious about using deliberate cold exposure which is how cold should the water be and I know it's very hard to give a straight prescription for that because I think it boils down to what you just said which is it's really the difference between your current temperature and really the temperature at the surface of your skin and the temperature of the water so if you're very warm getting into cold feels good if you're already cold getting into more cold feels stressful um is there any way that we can start to gauge what is the best way to approach a deliberate cold exposure protocol I mean should it feel uncomfortable and that leads into the question of how do we balance the discomfort with the amount of time that we spend in so for instance if it's just a little bit uncomfortable we spending more time in the cold get us the same benefit as getting into very un comfortably cold water for a very short period of time yeah that it's really good question and I definitely think that this could be um future studies on this as well to really unravel uh what kind of Protocols are the are the best way or also for which outcomes of course so if the temperature is uh very cold and you feel that and you also feel very cold then you you should stay in the water a little bit longer so I think it's just you should get uncomfortable cold so as long as you get uncomfortable cold it's cold enough and you get this what we call the cold shock so the cold shock is activation of your sympathetic nervous system and these activation of the the catacol mines which you just mentioned before does the shock mean that I'm having trouble controlling my breathing is that a good gauge uh yeah you can say so because that's kind of like how we Define it so you hyperventilate so you have a faster um uh breathing rate um so that increases also because you activate your gasping reflex if you are new to this um but if you are adapted it it kind of subsides with time with adaptation so what you can do is that you can train this cold exposure and you can kind of like Get adapted to it so you don't have this hyperventilating response every time you go out in the cold water so this is like building up your resilience building building up your adaptation is going to make this shock like subside a bit so it's it's always harder in the beginning but you should do hard things right it's not something that we you shouldn't think about cold water and cold water immersion as something that is comfortable it should be hard because that's the point of it right if you enjoy it then yeah then I'm I'm thinking something is wrong it's not right you should not enjoy it well this is an important point that you're making because I think that many people shy away from deliberate cold exposure because it's uncomfortable in a way that at least from my experience is very different than the discomfort of exercise because with exercise for instance um if running hard you know running fast and breathing hard is uncomfortable you can slow down or walk if um you know lifting weights is uncomfortable you can remove some weight or reduce the number of repetitions or stop with deliberate cold exposure I suppose you can be sort of halfway in halfway out of the water or partially underneath the cold shower but it's very hard to titrate and adjust the level to it's kind of all or none and I've seen um actually just I can tell this by anecdote I've done some work with military Special Operations um I won't say which country this was outside the US um and these are very tough individuals they're used to going without sleep and doing hard high consequence high risk kind of work and they were asked to do some cold water exposure training and I was there that day and it was remarkable about a third of them just went straight in just kind of grinded through it you know like they looked stoic anyway to me um there were a few whimpers no cries about a third um talked a lot and got really you could tell that they were agitated and anxious but they made it through and then about a third of them just simply would not get in past their knees or thighs were just it seemed like they were just dreading the whole experience some actually didn't actually go in completely um which was really surprising to me and I you couldn't tell based on their physical appearance or anything else about them they're all high performers as to who would have this response so it seems like people vary tremendously in terms of their ability to embrace the discomfort of the cold is that from your studies is that your experience as well or or are there these weird mutants who seem to just love going into the cold for the first time so some people just feel better in the cold and some people are dread the cold even more and you can say the more people are pushing the cold away they might feel the pain even more so they they they would definitely people who are maybe the solders you just talked about they some of them might be already adapted to the go cold so if they are not scared of the cold they go out and they embrace the cold in a better way it could also be that some people have a more sensitive nervous system and when you are a bit sensitive to the cold you will of course try to get away from it right and you will also have the Coan more um feel the Cain more if there if if you avoid it so the more you avoid the cold the the more pain painful it will feel uh when you go into it so yeah you mentioned being outside in a t-shirt versus um cold immersion up to the neck versus shower I think um this is something a lot of people wonder about what are the differences in terms of impact short-term and perhaps even long term between cold showers cold plunge to the neck so that could be in ice water or just very cold water um immersion with dunking one's head and then coming up because obviously people have to come up for air at some point and then simply being outside on a cold day in shorts and a t-shirt or something of that sort so there are different outcomes um because there they are very different uh exposures of the cold to your cold receptors in your skin so the more you can say you cover your body in the cold which you would do in cold water because there of course cover totally and then and the molecules are closer to your skin you will have a more potent um activation of all your cat receptors in the skin so that one will definitely activate your autonomous nervous system more and Rapid H compared to going out in a t-shirt in the cold wind just go for a walk um but that is also something that's going to activate your uh sympathetic nervous system meaning then that you will have an increase in nor panine and you will activate something called uh the the brown fat so this is a healthy kind of fat tissue that we have in our body and when you activate that that's going to um increase your metabolism before we talk about Brown fat and I'm so glad you brought it up um because so much to talk about there uh what about cold shower I mean obviously cold shower is somewhere in between yeah um being out outside in the Air Cold Air versus uh being immersed up to the neck if we had more studies on on cold showers we would learn more about how does that activate our metabolism how does that increase our neurotransmitters in the brain which could also have an impact our on our mental balance so I think that would be interesting for the future um but what we do know is from from from activating Brown fat and both from rodent St studies but also in humans is that as soon as we get cold on our skin we will activate our Brown fat so it is is kind of like our first responder in in the body to keep uh our um temperature up so our muscles is like the second tissue in our body we have two tissues which can increase our thermogenesis so the brown fat which is like always like temperature regulating our body and then we have uh the the muscles which will secondarily H start to shiver and that's going to increase our um temperature in the body but as soon as you go into a cold shower you will activate your fat also immediately so it could be good also for increasing metabolism in theory because we haven't really any studies showing how much does it actually activate the brown fat so if someone out there wants to do a study on that great I've thought about why there are fewer studies of cold showers than cold immersion and I think the answer to my mind is that from a methodological standpoint it's just harder to do because if people are getting into cold water up to the neck they're getting into cold water up to the the neck whereas if people are getting into a cold shower some people are larger or smaller some people are going to stand under the shower with it hitting their head some people the back of the neck you could direct people to do it yeah but it's a little bit um more difficult also I think uh for you and I are both research scientists there's a little bit of a um methological challenge that might seem silly to people but it's a real one which is if people are in a cold shower also the water is going to be I'm kind of pushing their clothing against their skin there's a certain vulnerability in uh for most people um coming to a laboratory in the first place let alone being observed while they shower whereas when you get into cold IM cold immersion you're getting under the water and you know some people might roll their eyes and say okay really is that the barrier but you know science exists in these real world contexts and this will vary by culture and things of that sort but we run human subjects in my lab and I'll tell you just um the process of getting people to the laboratory and having them Park and find the lab and you know it's a whole new environment with people in lab coats and people moving around and Where's the restroom I mean there's a there's a certain amount of stress just associated with taking part in a study for most human subjects so um I uh totally agree however we need more studies of of cold showers it's just a harder environment to control in in my in my mind so it sounds like any form of cold to the skin that people register as what you call a cold shock or uncomfortable like oh like this is kind of jarring activates the brown fat do we know what the pathway is from cold receptor on the skin to the brown fat I mean how does the brown fat know that we're cold yeah really good question and it seems that I I think that of course in the future we will know much more about these Pathways but what we do know is that uh the co- receptors will send a signal to our temperature regulating Center in in the brain so hypothalamus um and that's going to be um taking in this message and we have so many C receptors in the skin so it's going to be very fast as you can say if you immers the body into cold water this is going to be so rapid H so it will have a rapid increase in neurotransmitters in the brain for no adrenaline adrenaline and cortisol and which is not that much but it's but it's still there so you have this increase in uh no adrenalin which will then immediately activate the brown fat um because the you can say the activator is the most potent one cold and no adrenaline that's going to activate the bra but there's also a direct pathway from the C receptor in the skin to the to the brown fat which really shows that if because of these different Pathways it shows that that it could be that this tissue to keep us warm was was developed in in our evolvement as humans to keep us warm and to save us whenever the temperature on our skin varies just a little bit to keep us in that right homeostatic balance so we don't get hypothermic um but also so we don't get hyperthermic but because it seems that the brown fat is also activated when we get warmer in our skin so it's also um maybe a temperature regulator in our in our body but the pathways is different I think it's also a third pathway from directly from the muscles so the brown fat is also activated um even though the the muscles are starting to shiver so there's an extra pathway that way to keep our uh our temperature up so muscles and brown fat together to to keep us warm so we don't uh suffer too much in the in the cold water that's super interesting and what I here you pointing to is the existence of three parallel Pathways and this notion of parallel Pathways comes up over and over again in biology as you and I know and I I think it's important for people to know about because um as you said so so eloquently the when something is very important to our survival or Andor Evolution the brain and body uh inst multiple mechanisms for it not just one and um and so it sounds like it's cold skin cold on the skin triggers a response in the hypothalamus which then activates Brown fat cold receptors in the skin directly to the brown fat and then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat um I want to talk about Brown fat in depth and learn from you more about Brown fat um before that however I want to ask about shiver um I've heard that shiver causes the release of succinate um which then activates the brown fat is it known whether or not inducing shiver is important and when should PE people Shiver I mean I've gotten into cold plunges and shivered while I was in there and then I've also had the experience of getting into a cold plunger a cold shower then getting out when even standing outside on a warm day after swimming in a pool and then starting to shiver so the shiver comes later so how important is shiver and does it matter when shiver happens yeah well shivering is is good because that increases your metabolism and that's going to burn some calories in your body you shouldn't be so afraid of shivering I think because the Shivering as long as you don't get too hypothermic so if you don't if you don't sit in the cold water for too long um and what you just said by shivering after you get up that is because of the after drop something called the after drop is when your core temperature uh decreases even after you get out of the cold water and it always does that um your body because it as soon as you get into the cold water all the your blood vessels is going to constrict because you need to keep your blood in your core and and keep your vital organs warm so as soon as you get up that those blood vessel will open again and the warm blood will flow out and get colder and then flow back again into the core and that's going to decrease the temperature in your core of course so that's the drop so that's the got it I'm so glad you explained that I've heard um years ago whm Hof I heard him talk about the drop and I've heard colleagues of mine talk about the drop that's the first time I've ever heard it explained clearly let me let me make sure I understand this so um I get into cold water obviously I'm cold vessels constrict to keep blood near the center of my body keep me alive I get out the warming up of my body allows those vessels and capillaries to dilate again the blood goes out to the surface but the surface is still cold and so that blood is cooled and then my core body temperature drops and that's what you're referring to as the drop and that's what induces shiver exactly great and then am I right in thinking that then the shiver activates Brown fat which then warms me up again yes got it that's why you should end on the cold but we can get back to that yeah let's talk about yes ending on cold is um you know it's what I refer to as and what has now become known as the soberg principle which is um a really important principle about the importance of ending on cold um and not doing what I do which is to get into a hot shower or or back in the Sun but we we'll get back to that in in a few minutes so um that's wonderful um that you can explain that so clearly because I think that shiver is something that a lot of people do avoid people think oh I don't want the you know the chattering of the teeth and um and it feels like a loss of bodily control which really it is it's it's an autonomic response yeah but I don't think that people should should avoid it that much it's just like seeing shivering as a way of your body in the in a like it's training it's training for your for all your cells it's training for your muscles it's training off your metabolism and that's going to increase your What's called the insulin sensitivity so if you can like in your mind get used to the thought of shivering is just like when you go exercising in the training center and get that feeling of like oh this is tough now it hurts a little bit yeah it's going to hurt because that's what shivering also does but just a different way of training your cells in your body it's going to create what is healthy stress it's called hesis in the cells and the more you expose your your muscle cells or your brown fat cells to these kind of like healthy stresses exercise cold and heat exposure it's going to make them uh better at like activating and also um at keeping you healthy so as long as the the cells get exposed to this it's going to keep them on its toes you can say because it becomes more robust um increasing these heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins in the cells to um make you more robust for the next time and that is also what happens when you go to the training center and I keep like do drawing that paralen because people today know more about we know more about exercise and what that's is going to do to your muscle cells um and but the same kind of like training is also what you do when you go out and and into the cold water and submergent into cold water because that is just your cold training center you can say that and and also your heat Training Center going into the sauna because the cells are getting stronger with hortic stress so it's the same process just different practices I'm so glad that you brought up the fact that the discomfort or the embarrassment or both of shiver is still crucial to uh actually to reach for and try and experience the same way that with exercise um I think a lot of people don't realize this but when we did our series with Dr Andy Galpin it became clear to me what should have already been clear to me and I think that most people don't realize which is that if we were to measure um heart rate blood pressure um stress hormones and inflammation in a human being during exercise it would look as if they were ready to die blood pressure would be high inflammation is through the roof but all of that is setting in motion and AD adaptation or set of adaptations that allow blood pressure to be lower at rest that allow um inflammation markers to be lower at rest all the things that everybody is seeking with exercise and in addition to of course the aesthetic changes that people are seeking with exercise sounds like the exact same things are happening with the cold so um the Redundant message here seems to be that the more discomfort provided it's done safely just like with exercise the more shivering the um the more cold shock provided it's not to the extreme and stop somebody's heart right we can talk about thresholds for that a little bit later it sounds like all all of that is going to set in motion some long-term changes that will make people feel better and will improve health could you just touch on a few of the longer term changes that are known to occur I mean I'm well aware of the study showing that uh I think it was European Journal physiology it was uh the European Journal physiology showing long lasting increases in catac colomines dopamine norepinephrine and um epinephrine for many hours after deliberate cold exposure what are some of the other things that happen at the level of metabolism and brown fat in let's say the hours and um day after deliberate cold exposure as soon as you go in of course there's an activation but it seems like no you're asking for the the later outcomes like blood pressure and stuff like that is that what you mean yeah blood pressure but also in terms of metabolism I know that you know in your study you should and we'll talk about Brown fat in depth here in a moment but that there were changes to the brown fat that equate to changes in for instance people's ability to be comfor able in colder environments when they're not doing deliberate cold exposure or in the same way that I can um exercise on an exercise bike or go out for a hard run but then if I go hiking uh with the family on Sunday and it's a steep climb I could do that steep climb more easily because I'm quote unquote fit as a consequence of the of the exercise what are some what are some of the fitness adaptations of deliberate cold exposure yeah so what happens is that you you get adapted a little bit every time you go so you will like exercise get a Little Bit Stronger so every time you go into the cold water for every time you will be more exposed to it you will you feel more comfortable in the cold so you going to you're going to build your adaptation which happens on a metabolic level which is going to be the brown fat so you have more activation of your brown fat the mitochondria in the the brown fat cells are going to be um you'll have more of those and they will be more efficient at heating you up because it expects the body expects you to to do this again so you are prepared in a way the capillaries in your skin is also will also become better at like constricting so you will have a better Shield of your body to uh prepare you for the next time so you be become better at H going into the cold water in that way so the the body makes these mechanism and changes your body in a way so you can expose yourself to the next time right and uh and also you will have um also a your um stress response will also be subside a bit so you will have a less increase of your uh catac colomines um with time with time also you will have because of this activation of your uh Brown fat or your muscles you will have an increase in um uh in in your metabolism which will then make your insulin sensitivity uh better and this is shown in in studies for example um there's this interesting study I found just before I I started my PhD which was from um keeper stor um at L from 2016 where they measured um metabolism not in not on Brown fat but they measured insulin sensitivity in middle-aged men and women uh during one winter swimming season so they were not very young like they were in my study uh but they were they were middle-aged and I think this is very interesting so they during these four five months they were winter swimming they saw that they had a lower blood pressure after the season and they had a lower heart rate and they also saw that they have a better insulin sensitivity and I think that is very interesting because if you can have a better insulin sensitivity you can prevent lifestyle diseases so um and with lower blood pressure which is a a very strong outcome also for telling how much inflammation you have in the body and because it didn't measure Brown fat um I figured that it could be that was the missing link that was the one of the explanations to why we see this um less inflammation in the body so um the longer outcomes the long-term outcomes could be that you lower your blood pressure and you have a lower heart rate um you also um have a better insulin sensitivity and a better glucose balance but that was shown that is shown in my study I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's athletic greens.com / huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and we'll get back to the uh insulin sensitivity and glucose balance um that's a an impressive list of benefits um you know blood pressure of course most people are aware of blood pressure and what it is it's what they measure when we go to the doctor and um it's not very sexy nowadays you know blood pressure people oh you know blood pressure it's not you know people want to hear about the inflammatome and the microbiome and all of that stuff is really interesting but um I think that blood pressure doesn't get enough attention um and we have spoken to on this podcast to Dr Peter AA who um is an expert in longevity and health span and things of that sort and and I was surprised to learn again I shouldn't have been surprised that the number one reason people die worldwide is cerebral vascular disease and cardiovascular disease and there basically three things on the list of things to address one is not smoking um or vaping by the way not so there are a few other things related to blood markers apob and things of that sort but then the big one is blood pressure and so it's it's interesting because we don't think about blood pressure that much anymore um as a as the kind of people interested in health optimization and health but blood pressure is so vital to control so it's wonderful to hear that deliberate cold exposure is one way to control blood pressure I'm guessing in concert with other forms of exercise yeah um let's talk about Brown fat and um if you if you're willing I'd love to drill into Brown fat at a at a deep level um again my understanding of this is is far more Elementary than yours obviously you're the expert my understanding about Brown fat is that it's located in specific areas of our body uh maybe more widespread than when I learned in school I thought it was I was taught it was just at the clavicles in the back of the neck and upper back but who knows I learned that there's more of it when we're children maybe more distributed throughout our body and that it's rich in mitochondria but what is so special about the brown fat like if we could just go into the biology of brown fat a little bit what does it look like uh you've measured it in human subjects where is it distributed really can it expand its distribution can we activate and expand the amount of brown fat as adults and um for those of you that are cringing already thinking we're talking about getting fatter it's quite the opposite we're talking about not subcutaneous fat but fat located around the the organs but please educate me um tell me where I'm wrong and um expand my knowledge on Brown fat okay yeah you are not wrong but um it's definit it's true that there are more locations of the brown fat than we previously thought um there's this very nice study from 2017 by Lightner L where they had made these PES uh overlays of um their subjects but they can see where in the body do we have brown fat and where can we grow more Brown fat um so to say um so the brown fat is can is very plastic so it means that it can it can grow and it can decrease and this is proven in in studies where we have seen um um people with the f cryosa is like a very specific cancer type where people where from the 70s where we can see that if they have this specific kind of cancer type um they have a t they have this tumor on the adrenal gland so they have like a a huge increase in no adrenaline and because of that they have this continuous activation of the brown fat and they have grown a lot of brown fat in whole body abdomen or where it's located in these six different places but it is like very much compared to like normal people um and what they then see uh what we learned from the study is that brown fat can apparently grow if you have um an increase in nor adrenaline in the body it's not like you want that because when that happens you have a high blood pressure you don't want it chronically right you you just want it on like a short amount of time and then it can grow for a bit but you don't want it chronically of course not but because it it activates also your sympathetic nervous SYM so they have also showed they had high blood pressure they had H they lost a lot of weight of course because this is activating your metabol ISM so they they found luckily that when they removed this benign tumor H that uh the brown fat um decreases again to normal size and they gain weight again and they had normal blood pressure so the story ends well but it's kind of like proof of concept of that brown fat can actually grow so it's plastic in its in its way of like it can it can grow and it can decrease again so that's very good good studies to to see what it what what the body is capable of but we don't of course want all that brown fat we just want it to be um we just want to keep it actually and and keep it activated because what we see in studies is also that after the age of 40 um people um Studies have shown that there is an association with having less brown fat but increased obesity so of course we we don't know yet whether uh Brown fat decreases with a and therefore we get obese or we get obese and therefore we have less brown fat but as brown fat is an insulin sensitive organ in our body and we get obese H just like the muscles get less sensitive um insulin sensitive the brown fat does as well and therefore it maybe decreases it could be a theory that I think could be one of the reasons why we we don't see that much Brown fed in in elderly uh people some have a lot especially people working outside that there are study showing this who people who um work outside do physical work outside farmers and um interesting yeah Expos themselves to it so they'll just keep it in that way it's um and I suppose we should um clarify for people in case they don't know that insulin sensitivity is a very good thing you want that you want yourselves to be sensitive to insulin um insulin insensitivity is type two diabetes um and is associated with obesity um so just uh point clarification there uh yeah it's interesting to me I I I usually work out at home but I I go to a gym once or twice a week if I can because it's good if I see uh the outside world um and there are a few individuals at the the gym who are they're not particularly large or muscular um but they are incredibly um lean and their posture is great presumably from the muscular skeletal work um and they they're in their 70s and 80s I mean it's remarkable right and um and I know all the telltale signs of hormone augmentation I'm very good at spotting that there are a few telltale signs I've talked about this on other podcast and they're not that's not why they're they're they're um they're fit they're they they're clearly of that look and you see this outside the gym too of course for people that look like they've done a lot of physical labor their whole life yeah they're just moving a lot they they have strong hands and features and they're um and they're not necessarily excessively lean but you can tell that they've been using their muscular skeletal system and I like to talk to these people and asked them like not what are you doing now for your workout but what what did you grow up doing you know and I would say and obviously I haven't run statistics on this but more than 75% of them respond that they grew up on a farm or that they did some sort of manual labor or were a postman or a postwoman or doing something where they moved a a lot for their early years and throughout middle age and most of them are now in retirement but some of them are still working and they all still moving a lot so the relationship between shiver and brown fat makes sense to me but is it the case that as we're just moving around I've heard of neat non um exercise induced thermogenesis so if we're just moving around um that we are activating Brown fat or do does there need to be this stressor does there need to be shiver and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus to activate the brown fat in other words um is just staying active enough or do we need to do some sort of temperature uh shock type thing like deliberate cold exposure yeah I think that is really good question because how how also why do we have this tissue then if it's if it has to be extreme then you can question what what do we need this tissue for but it seems that you can activate the brown fat with just a little bit of exposure to to cold so cold is the the most potent stressor activator of our Brown fat because it's our temperature regulating organ in our body so first responder to that so the muscles will be a little bit too late uh and therefore we have maybe these two kind of tissues so actually just exposing yourself or a hand actually just to cold water so Studies have shown um that if you just put your hand in cold water not that you're going to going to do that all day or or every day or anything it's not it's it's not something you have to do but it just just shows that you can activate your brown fat just by getting a temperature change on your skin so you can go outside and t-shirt that's why also we were just talking about well people who works outside or move a lot or get out in and out of it like changing the temperature of the body all the time they will have more Brown fat and uh activating that is going to keep your metabolism higher and your insulin sensitivity a study have also shown this so the brown fat can be activated as soon as you just change your temperature in the skin so going outside in a t-shirt wearing cooling vests also Studies have shown this for 10 days it's going to also grow your uh your brown fat so you can get more Brown fat if you expose yourself to the cold you don't have to start in a cold uh shower you don't have to start in a cold uh plunge if you're not really ready for that yet but just exposing yourself to co wind has also shown to activate your brown fat or if you don't want to be like in this uh awake state um then you can also just sleep in the cold and you won't notice it that much maybe but Studies have shown that if you sleep in 19 degrees Celsius um then you will activate your brown fat and you will grow your brown fat so you have more of it so this very nice studies um from Hansen it Al from 2017 showed that a group of subjects who slept in a room at 24° and then they made this pet C scanning to see how much Brown fat do they have from the beginning so what we call Baseline then they measured again after um a month of sleeping in 19 degrees and they saw I think it's remarkable just one month at 19 degrees sleeping there they had a duet on and they were still had to close on when they're sleeping so they're under a cover under a duet under under a duet yeah yeah the subjects were sleeping at 19 degre from one month had increased his insulin sensitivity the next month they stepped at 24° they measured this again and then they had decreased actually a little bit and then they slept at the 27° so quite warm room actually for for the fourth month um and they saw even less activation of the brown fat and also insulin sensitivity so it seems that you can expose yourself and pretty rapidly the brown fat will respond to this because it's so sensitive to nor adrenaline right so if you keep exposing yourself to a little bit of cold you also get a little adapted to it but that's because the brown fat um has grown these more mitochondria in the cells so these small energy Fabrics that's going to activate the cells and that's going to take up glucose and fat from the fatty acids from the bloodstream to keep uh the thermogenesis up and that's going to clear up some sugar and it's going to clear so in the in the bloodstream and some some fat as well so the brown fat can in that way decrease our unhealthy fat which is the white fat um and the white fat is what we don't want too much of but we still need some of course um and it's our energy storage so it's very important that it's there we just don't need a lot of it so on our thighs and also around our inner organs that's where it's it's located so if we can have activation of the brown fat just by going out in the cold and just by sleeping in a cold room or if you are have courage for it you can go out and expose yourself in a cold lunch um cold showers is also going to do the so you can do different variations of this just exposing yourself to various temperatures is going to activate the brown fat because it was involved to keep us in a perfect homeostatic balance regarding temperature so to Keep Us Alive incredible uh I want to just get a clarification around this 19 degrees Celsius um room that they're sleeping in so they're under a comforter a duvet and um and you mentioned they had cloth on uh the room is 19 degrees celsus but the temperature underneath their blanket might not be 19° celus so presumably it's the cold on their face that's activating uh the the increase in uh Brown fat that was observed is that is that a reasonable uh expectation I I think so yeah because it's you have so many co-receptors in your face so it's actually it's enough and it I think corresponds very well with the studies showing that you can activate the brown fat just by putting a hand into a bucket of cold water H and I did this experiment myself myself in in my studies just to see how well did they H respond to cold water so it was a 4° Celsius cold water for four minutes and then I just measured blood pressure and heart rate to see do they have like an activation of this I actually also measured the brown fat during this uh Cod exposure for four minutes with an infrared thermography camera to see can I see that the brown fat is activated and just just to go back to the location of the brown fat so usually you cannot really see activation of your brown fat because it's located centrally in your around your central nervous system um and and the biggest Depot as you mentioned before is up here under the the cicular bones so um and very close to the skin surface and because it's so close to the skin surface I could measure it with this very expensive camera and it's not very feasible for people to go home and do this don't because it takes a lot of practice I can tell um but we measured the brown fat with this um and and I could see that after a few minutes that the activation was there an increase in temperature uh arose from that um activation just four minutes so it's very rapid and I'm also measured in my study how deep was the brown fat under your skin so it's very close to the surface which also shows that it it needs to be there to to heat you up and heat heat your inner organs well I'm delighted to hear all of this and I'll I'll tell you why one is by way of anecdote I mentioned a little bit earlier that as an undergraduate I worked in a lab that studied thermogenesis and we were doing that in animals but we had this room that was very cold the whole room was cold uh the guy who I worked for at the time had name Harry Carlile is a very accomplished physiologist he came from this lineage I don't know if this literature is still um discussed much but it's a beautiful literature um from Rothwell and stock they were the ones who discovered um non-exercise induced thermogenesis the fact that people bounce who bounce their legs a lot and move around a lot and have a lot of kind of um sarcastic movement um burn up to 18 1,800 calories more per day than people who sit more still fascinating incredible just incredible um I don't think that work deser uh gets as much attention as it deserves publish in journals like nature so very uh fine journals but in any event uh one of the things that I noticed when I started working in that laboratory was that I was cold because the room was cold and um Dr Carlile Harry um said well the key is to wear a t-shirt in here for about two three days and then you will cold adapt I thought well wouldn't I want to put on a hoodie and get warm in there so I was comfortable and he said no actually what you want to do is get yourself uncomfortably cold activate your brown fat and indeed when I did that I think it was just two days of being in that cold environment then I could come back on the third day and be perfectly comfortable because the brown fat had expanded um um or or added mitochondria or both and I was perfectly comfortable in that environment I also got very very lean in those um in those days and weeks now i' I've never been somebody who's very lean nor am I somebody who carries a lot of excess adapost tissue I'm kind of somewhere in the middle I'm sure I could adjust that with feeding if I want to but it was it was striking uh what a powerful effect it had on my entire system of thermal regulation and one of the things that I uh also delighted in when cell reports um medicine published your study is they had an accompanying um press release that went out to to those of us that receive press releases and it described a um a saying in Scandinavia which is um essentially I'm not going to attempt to uh speak uh Danish even though I have much of my family is in Denmark believe it or not from Denmark um we have a lot of Danes in my family um I won't embarrass myself by trying to speak Danish as I did before the the microphones were rolling but um that there's a saying that I think essentially translates to in the fall when when you're approaching winter you want to actually wear fewer layers not bundle up when you go outside so that you can prepare yourself for the cold of winter and be able to heat yourself up using your brown fat and that in the spring as the temperatures are warming rather than removing layers you want to wear more layers in order to be a little bit uncomfortably warm so that In the Heat of the summer you're better at Cooling your body do I have that right and maybe do you know the saying and would you be willing to share it only the swedes and um uh and Danes will be able to understand um maybe the Norwegians too if you don't know it that's okay yeah so I know the I know the the concept of it because we say it you should you should wear less before winter and uh and more before summer so well there it is in English so it doesn't have to be esoteric but okay yeah and and you're completely right and I think this is the this is just something that we know in the Scandinavian countries I think that we we we intuitively know this but if we just go back a little bit in history I think that um around the 1950s the the Russian government went out and said well we should do something about the tuberculosis pandemic or epidemic the was at this time so they they wanted to have the the people um be more resilient to the cold and also increase our immune system so in Scandinavia and actually also in Russia we put our babies outside to sleep H in the prom and that is like to H also to to get more resistant to the co but also to increase our immune system and we still do that in Denmark so we do you really yeah we do babies are taken out in the cold in the snow in Frosty rain everything my two boys have been sleeping out in winter or at least the F their first many three four five years because it's like very good for them and they get a better immune system and get resilient to the cold so they will have less colds and also they run around in a t-shirt when it's super cold because they have activated all the brown fat I didn't understand at that time I must I must say but I kind of like intuitively also knew because we have inherited this H way of doing things with our culture so and I have heard people coming from the US saying they are crazy they put their babies outside and PRS and leave them there and then they go inside and drink coffee on the cafe well I don't think Dames are crazy I I I I Adore the Danes um they're they're amazing uh culture and people I'm so fortunate to have family members uh from Denmark but I did notice so when when we were in Copenhagen and I know um we we saw you there uh not long ago that was June um the water in the harbor was was cold for for even though the Pacific is close to here um which is very cold uh felt pretty cold but I it was summertime is um so people were in summertime mode right t-shirts and shorts and things that that sort but it did strike me that people in Copenhagen are dramatically fitter than they are in the United States I mean first of all everyone's bicycling everywhere yeah um not many people wearing sunglasses so trying to extract as much Photon energy from the Sun as possible which I support uh as everyone knows that's I'm a big fan of getting Sun but also um when we did see swimmers um they were swimming in this cold water and like it was nothing and their the range and age of the swimmers was what was remarkable you saw the kind of fit triathlete looking types but also young kids like really young kids and then people probably in their again their their 70s 80s maybe even '90s really remarkable vastly different than what you see if you go to the ocean here in Los Angeles or or elsewhere so um yeah you Scandinavians are on to something with this I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there however is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information about what to do with all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc and then to assess what sorts of Behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes includes three new hormone markers that are critical to measure during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years these are estradi progesterone and thyroid stimulating hormone if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insidetracker tocomin to get 20% off I'd like to talk about your study um if you could give us a little bit of the backdrop about what motivated that study and then um and then walk through what you did you know who the subjects were um what you had them do what you measured um and as much detail as you would like to share because I think it's such an important you know even I fair to say landmark study because it also explored not just cold but sauna and the the co-use of cold and sauna as a way to proe metabolism and brown fat and other markers as well and as you do this uh I'm hoping at some point you might um tell us some of the observations that you might have made that interested you that perhaps were not in the paper because that's one of the great benefits of sitting across from somebody who who did the work in detail so um yeah if you could tell us about your study um and uh what you did and what you discovered thank you for that question Andrew I I love to like also explain a little bit what did we do because when people read this kind of paper they just see the numbers they don't see what what happened before that and human studs are very different from from my study my study you can do a knockout of something and then everything is like perfectly matched and controlled doing human studies is very far different from that because people are different even in the groups so yeah but what we um when I started this research in 2016 I did not really know what the brown fat was so I started reading up on all this and I was very interested in preventive medicine um also the studies that I did before Brown fat was also like very much in in the preventive side like how can we that was about something else but the Sweet Tooth and how can we lower our sweet tooth and stuff like that so but after that I wanted to to do something new so I looked into the brown fat got highered in this fantastic research group where they it's a cell group so they mostly did cell studies and they didn't have anyone to do a human study yet um and um but they really wanted me to to do that so I read upon a lot of research about how does the brown fat get activated what have been done already and I mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold I found that particular paper very fascinating and that was also where um at that time I was like okay so cold exposure as an intervention of sleeping in the cold could be a good thing to go out and say well people do this but on the other hand is first of all it was already done that was one thing but the other thing was like well I wanted to to see if we can do like some kind of activity so we can have people move also or go and do something do something together or whatever and and and the code uh made us think about well what about winter swimming and it was kind of like a bit of a joke in the beginning it's like winter swimming yeah it's going to activate the brown fed right but but when we read the literature we couldn't really find anything about activation of the brown fat with cold water besides hand in a bucket of cold water that really that was already there so we were just thinking okay so it should be very potent um activation of the brown fat if it's cold water but very different from cold air so it was kind of also a new thing we were going into and uh we knew that we were going to do like a more of a um proof of concept study um at the beginning of it because it was like winter swimmers um must in theory activate the brown fat right but we kind of didn't really know was was this kind of stressor too much too little or what will happen actually but we had this idea about well we always say that cold water and winter swimming will activate your metabolism but do but do we know if it do does that no we don't so um and while this idea was a little bit fun fun at the beginning um we kind of accepted it was like okay let's just try this out but because we didn't have the funding for it we was like okay let's do a proof of concept study uh um let's go with a small number but enough to see um a difference between the groups so the power calculation of that study is done on uh what we know uh from pet C scannings of the brown fat so that's the main outcome of that of course so um and we wanted to go a little bit smaller on the numbers of of participants because we wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the different mechanisms and also redo some of the the dat so I really wanted to do that to see if I can replicate also the findings and that's going to take a lot of a lot of funding but it's also going to take a lot of time to do it um so the proof of concept was just going small but looking at different mechanisms we also took um fat biopsies for example and looked at the white fat to see if there was any differences between the groups before and after and stuff like that so that's kind of like how it started and and the first year was like a field study for me so I was not a winter swimmer when I started this it was just oh really no I wasn't um at all and I would say I was a bit afraid of the cold myself um bit of a cold always cold having big socks on and sweaters and stuff like that so I was like I am so comfortable I'm just like everybody else very comfortable I like being completely temperature neutral um but I started like playing with this thought like well if this is so healthy in theory I should not pack myself up I should start not doing that yeah but the first year observation of winter swimmers on the jetty they kind of joked about it say come on you need to try this you cannot study this unless you have tried it and I was like haha very funny of course I can do that but I couldn't I I read the literature I understood in theory what happens when you go into cold water but I completely understood it when I first tried it the first few times not so funny it felt painful it was just like running too long uh after a long break and you and your muscles hurt the day after right you you completely regret that you took that extra mile what about when you say uncomfortable you mean uncomfortable when you got in and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards because I find that um on rare occasions well I should just full disclosure I I do deliberate cold exposure every morning for about a minute to two minutes in a cold plunge there are days that I miss but when I'm at home I do that and when I travel I do a cold shower I do finish with a warm shower so um and we'll talk about why that's probably not the best idea but um and I've been doing it for some years now um on and off uh but so just full disclosure I'm a devotee um and I have family members that uh hate the the cold but have gotten into it and and are starting to like it but they don't and I don't necessarily like the experience in the cold water but I love the way I feel when I get out and I have I'm 100% on that statement about loving it when I get out occasionally it feels good to be in there it feels invigorating and I think I've learned to control the gasp reflex and the hyperventilation and I just have told myself what we know which is that the forebrain struggles to engage for the first 20 or 30 seconds but if you can get past that wall it's it's far easier to to push through um but when you say that it was really uncomfortable do you mean the experience of getting in or you also felt lousy afterward yeah it's and very important to clear that out I only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment but afterwards the first time I went uh with with a group and actually my husband was there as well because I I really wanted someone I knew um coming alone because it's very normal if you haven't done this before you feel a little bit anxious about it didn't this is shown in studies as well because blood pressure and heart rate goes up in in those who are new to this kind of activity so um I was a little bit anxious about it so it was really uncomfortable just doing it but afterwards as soon as I got up I felt fantastic and we went into the SAA and I did three rounds because I just loved it I love the feeling afterwards because you have all these neutr transmitters going in your brain and you feel more positive you feel I feel invigorate I had so much energy uh and that like I I could totally see why people would do this to get energy throughout the day because I definitely had that I didn't have to do three dips to to get that I think one would be enough and I often do that also now today I do one dip sometimes I do two or three uh dips um in in one round you can say one day but uh often it's like just one or two times a week for me that is enough to to get that energy and to get that positive feeling and and I think that that is also why I I put up my study in that way I wanted to study the lowest dose you can say the lowest amount that we can get away with but still see um health benefits so what I observed there on the jetty was that some did it a long time they were in the water for a very long time and to me it seemed maybe a little bit extreme could you give me an example of long time well so maybe they were like really swimming and they could be 20 minutes or half an hour that's a long time that's a long time and there was like ice and people who came up I I mean I just didn't really feel that this is a something that I wanted to go out and recommend to people after my research subject dying either because if you're not adapted I mean people you know people can do that also a 20 minute cold shower or 20 minute cold plunge I know people do it but it's probably not a good idea no probably not it's going to exhaust your cells and a make them age too fast so exactly that's uh when you pass that htic stress this the healthy stress level that that's what is happening the quite opposite is it's a almost chronic stress actually in the cells well what happened then was that um I found out that if I want to have this protocol get through ethical committee I I really needed to go like very like Sleek with the not too long and and make sure that they were also very healthy and and to get approval of course of this study um but what I did was to to recruit winter swimmers who already have been swimming for two or three seasons and I just observed them I said I'm not going to do an intervention study yet I did that after but I I wanted to do like a proof of concept where they were already adapted to the cold and then compare them to a match control group who were matched on um on you can say diet so were they vegetarian or not um and one of them was in each group U also they weren't all vegetarians no no no just one in each group I going to say with all the amazing fish meat in uh in Denmark I'd have a hard time being a vegetarian the breads are amazing the fruits and vegetables too but okay so there were a couple vegetarians in each group yeah one one in each yeah okay and then token vegetarian I have family members are vegetarian so I'm just poking fun yeah but they were they were matched on different things so what we usually match the mono is also BMI um we chose one gender in this study and we would always choose both men and women nor normally but we do see that there are different Brown fat levels uh depending on gender so women have more Brown fat than men really H yeah interesting yeah I think it's interesting uh that deserves study yeah yeah why actually I think it's interesting because women are also smaller so in size and mass right but they also have um a lower peripheral temperature especially on hands and ears and is that right that's that's documented that women do run colder than men yeah and there's physiologically I didn't say psychologically no no no we won't we won't go to the psychological cold cold heat that's different something else that's a different podcast yeah another time so women are just colder physically uh so on hands and ears it's measured on that um and and and feet as well so compared to men and men have bigger Hearts than women and they can pump out more blood uh peripher than in a woman's body so they that could be an explanation for the colder hands for example theroc comfortable state is also different between G genders so men are more comfortable at 22° Cel and women are therm comfortable at 24 degrees celius and this okay so the thermostat Wars of home have been now validated yes yes there's a 2 degrees C by the way prior to um starting recording uh I made the executive decision that we were going to go with Celsius throughout the podcast um because the majority of the world uses Celsius so for those of you that think in Fahrenheit um the internet is your friend in making those conversions so we're sticking with Celsius so men tend to be Thermo comfortable at 22 degrees C women at 24 okay interesting explains a lot about like also some arguments in the homes where men are turning down the heater and women are turning up the heater and they cannot really so it's it's really it's I'm on both sides here I understand the men we understand the women but it's there is a difference there which was also one of the reasons why we had we in this proof of concept study chose one gender so it is not like only because we wanted to study men it was just to see to eliminate H all the confounding factors which could have an impact on on our results so um that was one of the reasons um but also because we yeah so women have have more Brown fat than men and otherwise we would have to like do four groups or something like that and not having funding yet we were like okay we need to do like just one a group just a control group and then a and a group who will always to Winter swimmers so I recruited winter swimmers who have been swimming for two to three seasons um because I wanted them to be already adapted but not going too long in the water so they told me uh I did a lot of screening here of course beforehand and interviews to see to ask them how much do you do and um how much do you how long do you stay in the water and I um monitored how long that they didn't stay in the water and recruited based on um that they only did like two to three times per week it seems reasonable uh for for for Denmark at least to do that and they stayed only in the water for one to two minutes so the cast subsides very quickly and you will get this activation of your rest and digest system which is your parasym nervous system so the the other branch of your autonomous nervous system and you get that activation because you submerge into cold water and when you do that you have an activation of your diving response and uh that's going to slow down the you can say the the consumption of oxygen also in your body and that's going to slow down your heart rate could I pause you on this because I've heard this before that when we get into cold water shower or immersion we get this sympathetic autonomic response so increased blood pressure increased heart rate release of neopine phrine from the locus culus in the brain release of um adrenaline dopamine adrenaline from the from the adrenals dopamine presumably within the brain but that the parasympathetic response is activated when we put our face into cold water or go underwater and that's a calming relaxation response so this brings us back to I don't want to take us off track from you describing the study but this brings us back to the first question which is if I go completely underwater for a moment when I start my cold plunge does that change the physiological outcome as compared to if I just submerge myself up to the neck and and actually nowadays there's seems to be a little bit of a movement online of people putting a bowl of ice water on their countertop and submerging their face into it did you see this this a start I've was see more and more posts about this so um could you just touch on the what the dive reflex is and why it act perhaps activates the parasympathetic response this calming response well so the diving reflex is activated when you submerge into cold water um even just to the neck yeah or I thought you had to get your face under I'm not I'm not arguing different you're the expert I just want to yeah I haven't really I haven't read that I've just seen that you can activate your uh diving response as soon as you go underwater with your body um so you don't have to do it with your face as far as I understand I could I could be wrong though um yeah so when when you activate your uh diving response you will slow down your um your oxygen consumption in your body and that is because the body tries to preserve um oxygen so you will not get hypothermic too fast so it's kind of like a survival system in your body um so this survival system is very um important for us of course so that will be activated and because of that you will after maybe one minute or so I'm I can't be precise on that because I maybe also varies a bit in in humans so one to two minutes you will have full activation of the sympathetic nervous system but also the Paras sympatic nervous system um and that's going to activate for example something like serotonin in your brain which is like also good for mental balance and people feeling in mental balance afterwards they after they go up so that is like measured on a questionnaires and also measured like on on anecdotes of course people tell all the time that they feel good afterwards we need studies on this so if anyone's sitting out there thinking that's interesting then please do some studies on that yeah I agree to get more out on that yeah so you had So You observe these winter swimmers who have done this for a few seasons yeah they're coming around for a new season of winter swimming and you've decided to recruit them as subjects they are getting into cold water um climbing down a ladder or jumping into the water up to their neck yeah climbing yeah okay climbing down a ladder into because this is done Outdoors what a fun study to do my my graduate thesis was done under fluorescent lights with no windows in a in a building that uh I mean I had a ton of fun as a PhD student I actually lived in the laboratory as a PhD student I loved it so much but um not something required to do a PhD by the way but um they're climbing down the ladder yeah getting up to their neck staying in for one to two minutes and then getting out and how many times a week are they doing this so they do this two to three times per week and for each time they go each day they go H they take three rounds uh off so three dips and two SAA sessions so they start in the cold and they end in the cold water okay so it's get in for one to two minutes then get out and get into the sauna yeah um what is the temperature of the sauna uh about 80° Celsius okay then how long are they in the sauna so they stayed there for 10 to 15 minutes so depending on if they went two times per week or three times per week okay and then they get back into the cold for a few minutes yeah two minutes up to two minutes yeah okay then back into the sauna 15 minutes or so yeah then back into the cold for a third round yeah back into the sauna and then then they're ending on the cold and then back into the cold again and then ending on cold and uh and we'll talk about why it's important to end on cold the so-called soberg principle um how cold was the water in this particular given average because I realize it's outdoor winter swimming so it's going to vary depending on wind chill and things as well course of course so it's a very uncontrolled environment to do this kind of studi in but I wanted to do something that was also very close to something people can do for free going out in nature and use that and also have the nature like it's a very healthy impact on us it lowers our stress uh stress level as well so by doing so I also measured the temperature every time they went so I have this graph and it's actually in the winter swimming book it shows the temperature in Denmark going like from October to April and it's like starts at 12° I think it's around 12 12 de Celsius um the water and then it goes down to 2° in on average in January and then up again um so it's within the spectrum of very cold water I would say from around 15 15° Cel and and down but it was actually not colder than like 2 to four degrees like in in on average when it was the coldest so it doesn't have to be that cold to be good enough and and enough to activate our metabolism um and what time of day are um the participants doing this cold sauna alternation so I think they did this uh throughout the day so I didn't control whether they wanted to go in the morning in the afternoon or or in the evening at that time where I set up the study I would I was not controlling it in that way I wanted them to go whenever they had time and I also think that is the most important message to give out to give to people is when do it when you have time it's not if if if doing it a when you get home from work and it's 6:00 in the evening and this is the time where you are where you can do it then then then try out if it's going to impact your sleep or not uh if it doesn't impact your sleep then fine but you have to try for yourself and find out what works for you it's the same for coffee for example right some people can drink coffee in the evening and go to bed and they can sleep H I can't or exercise or exercise exactly so I can't I can't do that and that's because the coffee exercise cold water um immersion it's going to activate your sympathetic nervous system you have an increase in stress response in your body and and that's going to make it really hard to fall asleep for some people at least maybe you are super exhausted anyways and then you will just crash anyways but yeah but um that's that's the only thing so I just told them to do this if they can during the daytime um and that's primarily what they also did and then uh all along you're measuring Brown fat by way of this infrared uh camera right um so what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat how quickly did that occur and um and then I'd like to ask also about sauna a bit more um because earlier you mentioned that you can activate Brown fat with sauna as well with heat on the surface surface of the skin um how long did it take before you observe significant increases in brown fat um and was it increased density of my brown fat or distribution was it you know showing expansion to different regions throughout the body and um maybe you could also touch on some of the changes in in insulin sensitivity and metabolism yeah a very good good question and and I didn't mention this before but besides measuring um temperature as an outcome for brown fat activity we also uh did pet MRI scanning of the brown fat so this is like the the golden standard uh for measuring Brown fat and it's not very feasible for normal people to get an an a PET CT or pit MRI scanning of the brown fat is super expensive um so we had both uh to see if we could have like a continuous measure of brown fat in humans because that was already not not out there so I wanted to see during both the experimental days but also during day and night what kind of like sadian uh Rhythm do we have in our Brown fat activity so that's why I wanted to have that as well so the PET CT scanning or the pet MRI scanning was to see upon code activation um stimulation for some hours do we have activation can we see the brown fat in this subject and also during thermoneutrality or thermal comfortable State uh how is that activated in each of the group of course ah so you want to see how comfortable people were away from the cold water and sauna just at different um temperatured environments is that right yes I also mened that how comfortable are you I I made this scale like visual analog scale and asked them how comfortable do you feel with this temperature um and throughout the study days during Cod exposure and thermal comfortable day that had a whole day where I just kept them therm comfortable to see do they activate the brown fat if they're just completely therm comfortable as good as we could get with that because we were asking people um on a scale from one one to 10 and five being theroc comfortable where are you on this scale so one would be very cold and 10 would be super burning hot um yeah and so that was a way to like try to figure out how do they actually feel also during the studies I also measured um Electro myography so of of muscles to see do they shiver during the cooling day uh sometimes people shiver before they know they're really shivering so I had interesting yeah so so our conscious perception of shivering might not be the best readout of shiver yeah well if you also get adapted to the cold water you will have less shivering they would be less vigorous they will be very small so you wouldn't probably know that you shivering because it's the Shivering is so small and the mitochondria in the muscle cells will be so densed that it doesn't need to shiver maybe that much to get that thermogenesis going um compared to when you're completely new uh to co water exposure you're not adapted then the body needs to create this mitochondria this energy fabric to keep you you warm and that's also what the exercise is in the beginning but um when we measured this we we did see that the winter swimmers were shivering less H or uh having less uh vigorous shivering when they said I'm cold so even though they they perception their perception of the cold was pretty similar in in the in the groups um we could see that the the activation of the the muscles that measured on um were different and more vigorous in the control group were the subjects incentivized to be in the study were they paid or anything of that sort they just happen to like doing uh cold and sauna and so that's why they did the study um well they got paid a little bit for it but not much and um that's how we do this St sure I was just curious yeah I was just curious there might be some folks that Wonder so so what did you discover in terms of changes in brown fat insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity rather and um metabolism so what we we saw was we had this kind of different measures uh to see what's to try and unre what what's actually going on when they are already adapted to the cold water compared to a control group who was matched on on various parameters we we did see that the winter swimmers had an increased insulin sensitivity they produced less insulin uh on all the experimental days so besides from just cooling them and measuring the brown fat on each of these cooling days there were two cooling days and one theroc comfortable day right so I wanted to measure insulin when they just they were fasting meaning that they hadn't eaten in uh eight hours before the study day um and they were completely laying still not moving just in a bed um and we measured insulin uh during the experimental day just to see how what level are they on and we could see that the the the winter swim it had lower production of insulin and they also when they had an glucose drink so we give them that to see if they to test before we enroll them in studies to see if they have diabetes for example and not knowing for example that that wouldn't that would like ruin maybe the studies so we test for that and see if they have like a normal curve so what we did see in that was that the winter swimmers had a faster glucose clearance in the bloodstream so after 2 hours uh we could see that they had a lower level and it went the curve went down faster than in the control group so despite having lower insulin release they have better blood glucose clearance which is really what you want what we all seek right you don't excessive insulin is bad insulin being a um more or less a chaperone for blood glucose um um can do all sorts of other things as well of course but um and having high blood glucose obviously terrible yeah for cells especially brain cells I don't think people realize how toxic high blood glucose is having high glucose is if you want to kill neurons you make you make their uh put them in an environment where there's too much sugar ah um oh yeah very yeah very neurotoxic I mean that's and there are mechanisms like insulin that buffer that keep you know keeping blood glucose in a reasonable range so that um it doesn't happen I mean I think that's why people will go into insulinemic shock hypoglycemic shock is also possible so that range in which neurons are happy is not AIT is not a tremendously large range incidentally the range in which neurons are are um happy and surviving uh is much greater as one gets colder than when you heat up I mean you you can basically destroy brain cells by getting too hot for too long oh yeah yeah you can definitely destroy brain cells permanently by getting too cold for too long but you have to get really really cold for a really long time yeah yeah um very interesting yeah we we're thinking about doing an episode on um uh sort of survival of the brain after death kind of things which actually happens you know you hear about these people who are declared dead and then come back and there is actually now a lot of cryopreservation type approaches for that this is uh anyway we risk going into the the uh the esoteric now so I'll steer us back to our discussion about your study but um so if I do the math these subjects are in the cold let's say they're doing three rounds of cold for one to two minutes three t two or three times a week what were the thresholds that you discovered were important for getting these positive changes in um such as reduce blood sugar or clearance of blood sugar um being more efficient uh reduced insulin um improved ground fat distribution and density um how much cold exposure do people need how much heat exposure do people need in order to extract these benefits yeah so when we then calculated the numbers together we can see that this was ended up being 11 minutes in total per week uh so not in one session of course but they had two to three visits to the water and the sauna per week so when we divide that out it corresponds to being in cold water one to two minutes at a time but also in the SAA 10 to 15 minutes at a time and I think this is very like um also similar to what we see in other studies when we look for example to the observational studies from the Finish cohort study from laen at L for example they published this very amazing paper in 2015 um some results from this long C study where they show that um that up to 30 minutes uh in the sauna was uh healthy and they you you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and that's like the threshold and if you go further than that then there is not more uh um healthy benefits to to gain from that so um and before that it's like 19 minutes then you will have this dose response relationship up to 19 minutes that's really in decreasing your risk of cardiovascular diseases and I think we that's per week 90 minutes per week uh 90 minutes per session now per session yeah per session if we um uh then compare that with my study which was 10 to 15 minutes per session then I think it fits very well with what we call the htic stress or healthy stress you expose the cells to this kind of like potent very uh stressful situation uh where they increase heat shock proteins in the cells and that will repair the cells but if you then overdo it and you go beyond the maybe 30 minutes in the Sona this observational study from uh Finland with more than up to 2,000 Sona bathers where have followed these for 20 years they see that a 30 minutes possession is like enough and if if you go above that you don't get more health benefits out of it so I think there's a window where we can say the healthy stress corresponds to like 10 minutes and I think it's like per session per session and it's not it's not much actually so you don't need to it shows that you don't have to expose yourself very much to the Heat or very much actually to the cold to get this healthy benefits uh from going into cold going to heat and have healthy to benefits on your cardiovascular system so I think this is a very important also message to to to get out that you don't have to go extreme you don't have to swim for half an hour in the cold water you can go in the water for one to two minutes um per session but go up to 11 minutes per week in total and for the SAA my study showed 57 minutes in total per week and if we also then divide it out on these two to three days and two session each day correspond to 10 to 15 minutes so it's a low Tres hole but I think it's it's good to have that to maybe we can aim for that if if people need to have something to to aim for and I think and I think it's really good to have that because then you you don't have then you don't overdo it and if you overdo it you exhaust the cells and that will increase your risk of cardiovascular disease also so well I get a lot of questions about this and I did solicit for questions for this podcast on on Twitter and one of the questions that I got was as one becomes more cold adapted do the benefits start to wear off or can people do too much cold exposure of course the answer to that is yes you can become hypothermic but I'm sensing a different answer now which is if I understand correctly um the threshold is 11 minutes total per week of deliberate cold exposure divided into two or three sessions of maybe one to 3 minutes depending on how long somebody stays in and then 57 minutes I want to be careful not to round up um to an hour but divide it into maybe three 20 minute sessions or so you know um so one doesn't have to be perfect as long as you get beyond that threshold exactly but I I wonder something which is is it the case that if somebody said oh you know I'm just going to do one 11 minute session per week that might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up because what you told us earlier is that the hormetic response depends on having that cold shock you actually don't want to become too cold adapted I mean once the blood pressure response drops down so in minute four five and six yeah you're getting very cold and you're shivering but you're one is not getting the autonomic stimulus that they want I guess I could liken this to um if exercise worked in a way where it was only the first few minutes of exercise that really triggered the adaptation of course this is not how it works but um in fact probably quite the opposite um but if that were the case then it's not simply the total amount of exercise but dividing up the the the sessions into little bouts where every single time it acts as a as a stimulus that seems to be the key here um this is very important um because having watch the landscape of this on social media but also in books and generally um I think you're the first person to really touch on this that the goal is not to get so cold adapted that you can sit in for the full 11 minutes in one session where the goal goal isn't to be able to do an hour of very hot sauna if you want to I suppose people could do it for other reasons but if the goal is to improve these Health metrics yeah then the idea is to keep the stimulus a stimulus short exactly yeah great well this also I think there's practical feasibility as you pointed out because getting into a cold shower or cold immersion or natural body water for a couple of minutes is far less uh um you know challenging to most people than finding a full morning to go you know spend there um but I've never really heard it articulated that the longer sessions might not be beneficial and might actually be detrimental um that's very important uh were there any other observations that you made um that did not make it into the paper or that were kind of in the the margin notes in terms of psychological benefits um or anything of that sort there was this recent study on soldiers that talked about weight loss it's sort of a controversial study um for a lot of reasons um but one of the things they remarked uh in the paper was that there were a lot of psychological changes improved buffering against anxiety um they even the men and women in that study um reported one of the significant effects was um significantly improved sexual satisfaction of they didn't tell us what that meant for these subjects but so we won't go there but but a number of subjective improvements was there anything that you observed or took note of in in your study that perhaps didn't make the main abstract but that we should be aware of uh yeah there was some um and I'm I'm today I regret that I didn't measure on sleep for example I I frankly didn't really think about that when I I when I designed the study um so we were very um much occupied with the metabolism and kind of had the thought maybe this could impact Sleep Quality um and I wish I just I had the thought that why don't you just ask them in a questionnaire but I asked them every morning or every morning was not many mornings just two mornings actually we measured on um but the winter swimmers um told us before I rode them that they had a really good sleep quality the control group also had that but they told me on the day where we measured the brown fat on on a day and a night night so for actually two days and two nights um they told me that they didn't they had a good night's sleep but they also woke up so it's just telling me that they also had like a quick wake up and then they fell asleep again um and the winter swimmers uh so that they have a really good sleep so it's like and in general they also say we we sleep very well I sleep very well so it's anecdotally in general it corresponds to what I heard in my study but nothing that I measured on um which would could be fun to do in the future but we didn't measure on Sleep Quality that would be have been a really good idea to do they also told me that they were very comfortable when they were cold they they don't mind winter swimmers they don't mind um going out for example um in in the cat with a t-shirt there were also less uh scared of showing their skin that was also one observation interesting yeah so kind of a redu social anxiety yeah they were just so comfortable in the lab you as you just mentioned before coats on and everybody Jing around it was very busy and um all the other um scientists out in the hallway and also my supervisor had her office down down the hallway and and one of the winter swimmers one day just got out of bed after have been in the study for eight hours we it was a long day right he jumped out of the bed and had his clothes in the bathroom and he went out completely naked he didn't care he just went out it was like oh wa so that's a side effect perhaps of getting too comfortable with the cold um we're not recommending that although in your book you um did a uh you dedicated some let me start that again although in your book you dedicated some uh pages to um naked winter swimming or I should say naked cold water exposure as opposed to um uh with bathing suit yeah are there any data on this I'm sorry chuckling but um I think in most places in the United States it's uh skinny dipping is not um is not legal uh most public beaches there are a few in fact where I I my laboratory before moving to Stanford was in San Diego and I at the sulk Institute for biological studies beautiful building incredible Sciences done there the beach right below that it's called Black's Beach okay and um and it's a known nude beach um and so whenever tourists were heading down the stairway there um I would you know sort of let them know especially if they had kids I'd let them know you know and it's a nude beach of a particular um uh of a particular genre so I I'd give them a little warning about what what they could expect down below it's a um in any event th those beaches are quite rare um in the United States maybe compared to Europe I don't know um but yeah maybe yeah so is there anything special about um clothless versus clothed um exposure yeah I think in that sense uh we are a bit more free with this kind of like but but remember we also had this winter swimming culture for so for hundreds of years in Denmark and the winter the oldest winter swimming clubs that we have especially the one we have in Copenhagen where I did my next study which we haven't talked about but and it's also not published yet but um in that winter swimming club it's the oldest one we have and it's huge and they they swim naked at this facility men and women men anden women and they have Sona where they can go in together and they also have the separate sonas but it's very much a a Danish thing and and I think it's I think it's I think it's good if people want that um and I had it in my book because people want to know if they have to swim with their bathing suit on or if they can take it off or what's the what's the difference is there any difference in this and if you ask me there is no difference if you have your little skinny bikini on it's not going to do any difference to your cold exposure or your adaptation it's not going to do any difference for your benefits of course but I think that it has something else it has something to do with how you also absorb yourself how you absorb your surroundings and it's sometime some sense of freedom in skinny dipping so I think people in Denmark who does this is they do the winter swimming because they feel free when they do that they come home from work they go to this club and they skinny dip and they feel like in touch with nature and they have maybe done this their whole life so this is an old tradition in Denmark in some of the clubs um but the newer clubs that are coming they don't they don't skinny dip so everyone has bathing suit I never Skinny Dip because there are people around people with phones and taking pictures all the time so this different different nowadays everything's recorded yeah and also this this old tradition is also fading away because of that yeah I um I use sauna and cold at home but when I travel there there's a a b so Russian B has hot sauna and cold plunge um there's one in San Francisco called Archimedes B um and that one is clothing optional so some people are clothed such as myself and then other people are not and it's co-ed most of the time I think they have male female separated uh evenings or something like that and then um the other B is Spa 88 which is in on Wall Street in New York is an amazing b as well um and these are starting to crop up in different cities or maybe they've been there for a long time and as deliberate cold exposure in sauna gets more popular more people are using them the the one in New York that I that spy 88 is always clothed um and it's interesting because you know people here uh naked or skinny dipping and they they might get certain ideas in mind it um yeah all these places are very well lit and they all have a tone of kind of um of Health that it's about the kind of health and and and Wellness um I guess the point being that um there's no requirement uh to do one thing or the other um although in the studies that uh you did obviously um people were clothed but I I did um I did pay attention to those pages in your book I thought it was interesting that you put some um some dedicated uh passages in your book related to this and I think my publisher wanted that yourish that it was not me it was like my publisher really wanted to have it little discussion about that so I was like okay well I think it you know it points to a larger theme which is I think for a lot of people people who already do these practices um there's no shock there um for people that do not do deliberate cold exposure or sauna I think that um you know there is this idea perhaps that oh you know these are um Traditions that are are kind of Fringe or that they're kind and I just I want to um cue that point because there's so many things that are happening right now in biomedical research and Medicine you know serious quality peer-reviewed studies published in excellent journals like your paper on things like deliberate cold exposure sauna um the use of particular supplements natural natural herbs and supplements I mean there's an entire branch of the National Institutes of Health in the United States dedicated just to the study of supplements and behavioral interventions for health like meditation and breath work really incredible it's really incredible and psychedelics of course being something that for a long time was part of a certain community and feel and now is being um frankly adopted by stream Med medicine even Pharma so it the the times are changing um and so uh yes I think it's important to know that um it's perfectly acceptable and encouraged to wear clothing so absolutely absolutely yeah yeah yeah and and one other thing that uh I wanted to to mention going back to your questions around with there were any observations in the studies which we really maybe haven't discussed yet and maybe it's in in the back of the the paper and not mentioned that much was one of the winter swimmers didn't have any brown fat when we measured him zero zero and uh in we do see this um in in in previous studies as well that some humans don't have any brown fat was he did he carry a lot of white fat atopus tissue was he was he obese no he wasn't no he was not obese because that he would not have been in the study then oh right yes you mentioned this earlier forgive me no no fine but he was um but what I did observe before knew that he didn't have any Browner was that during the cooling experiment where I cooled them for uh 2 hours before they go into the Pet City scanner uh he was not able to control his shivering like the winter swimmers uh could so he got he got very uh cold very easily uh compared to the others so and without I didn't know what was different about him but we could all all our me and the three others were working on the experiment we were like okay what's going on because we turned down the the temperature but he started like shivering and then we had to turn it up again and it was just all over the place the temperature it's not it wasn't that controlled like the others was pretty similar protocol I could just do pretty much the same because they were same size and also same gender so it it it was easier uh to like foresee what was going to happen when will they start Shiver I quickly learned that but with this subject it was just with this uh volunteer was just very much different and then when we scanned him and didn't find any brown I I I didn't even think about it so when we scanned him we didn't see anything I told the pet C people to like oh you put up the wrong uh scanning blame the technology yeah the technology it was like this scanning looked like the Thermon neutral day the therm comfortable day where we also scanned them to see if they have any brown fat so you have made a mistake I was pretty sure and they reanal anal analyzed this um scanning and they just concluded well it the scanning was fine the experiment went well it was just that he didn't have any brown fat so he was like what we just in the paper called a a brown fat negative so he didn't have any and in in my studies it would be called a knockout so it didn't have any brown fat so what the observation with him and I think that that's interesting is that he both shivered very early on and didn't regulate his temperatures well he also told me that then he was like a five on the scale of how comfortable he felt with the cold um out of so it was from 1 to 10 and five being thermal comfortable and 10 being uh very uh cold uh and and one very hot so on this like scale up and up and down and he he was like more up and down on this scale than any of the others it was an observation that I did um but we did see in his blood samples also that his blood samples looked a bit more like the control group um also his insulin levels were like the control group so a little bit higher than the other winter swimmers and he also had um a a a his glucose clearance was not as fast as um as the the other winter swimmers so he was like an outlier what we call it and in the analysis we also had to take him out of the analysis because he was an outlier um so the results showing that the brown fat uh is more efficiently activated in the winter swimmers is without him having him in that group but it didn't ruin this the study if we I tried to put him in in as well and didn't it didn't ruin the results or anything but just to to keep it more clear we put to come out of the analysis yeah so he was a mutant a knockout yeah and I'm sure they're out there um very interesting so if you shiver early um then perhaps you have less brown fat to begin with although it's hard to conclude from one person that's sort of the the the implication there or you haven't adapted to the Cod so you should build that up yeah right so in addition to looking at regulation of blood sugar round fat metabolism and so on were there any markers that you you examined in the deliberate cold exposure group as compared to controls um that reveal to you that deliberate cold exposure could have additional benefits um say for uh immune system function um or for any function for that matter yeah so for we looked at in inflammation of course we measure the outcome of blood pressure and so on but we also measured the IL six in the study just to see also an inflammatory anti-inflammatory marker so I six when up and it also follows with the i 10 so that is like also very known in the literature so we measured that and I think it's very important to to think about the cold exposure and the heat exposure as something that then lowers the inflammation in the body and with if we can do that we will have an open door for um preventing lifestyle diseases right so for um type two diabetes but actually also for some mental diseases as well so as known as depression and anxiety and also Alzheimer's disease which are all Associated um in research also neuro research showing that that inflammation increases the risk of depression anxiety and Alzheimer's with neurological diseases so if we can decrease inflammation in the body we will decrease our modern lifestyle diseases but also these increasing um mental diseases that we see in these modern lifestyle times um so I think that it's I think it's very interesting that we can go out in nature and we can use these natural stressors and it it I don't want to have it sound very romantic or anything it's just it's just exposure to temperature actually just to cold or to heat that is going to twk our body into a natural state again and and reset it where the the homeostasis the balance has is lost a bit so the body is going to repair itself in that way and I think it's beautiful that we can do that just by changing the temperature of our body and although people are very scared of doing this because in our times we have been way from cold away from heat temperature for some for decades now um since we isolated our houses better and uh we are more sedentary we also sit more indoor we don't move as much so this very um modern sedentary lifestyle has made us more temperature comfortable just neutral so no no wonder I mean that obesity is increasing we don't expose ourself to the Natural stresses that we did earlier on um in in our evolvement but Al up until maybe the 70s the 60s where we started having more like uh comfortable Lifestyles right and obesity increases in the in the 80s we can see that from statistics so I think that if we can take in cold and Heat and you mentioned other things also before but of course exercise is very important here and also a bit of fasting actually because it all increases the homematic stress in the body so it's doesn't have to be uh other than natural stresses to the body which then could keep us in that Natural Balance again could we talk about what I refer to as the soberg principle which is to end on cold and the reason I called it the sober principles because um in reviewing oh by the way I wasn't a official reviewer of your paper but I mean in reading and um reviewing your paper for its after published Contents I noticed that you had people end on cold and this has been a longstanding debate in the the uh deliberate cold exposure Community should you warm up in a with a warm shower afterwards or get back in the sauna what should you end end on cold or end on Heat and the sober principle says end on cold as I understand it in order to force your body to heat itself back up and thereby increase metabolism further still is that right yes so when you when you end on the cold you you force your body to heat up by itself and that will require that you activate you keep your brown fat activated and also your muscles which is a good thing it's a good collaboration to keep your thermogenesis up and that's like an an exercise even when you go home so in that way you don't have to think about your cold exposure dipping in in your plung uh or open sea or what it is as just a an exercise that you do for one to two minutes and then it's over if you end on the cold you have an exercise for your body going on for hours afterwards and that's not only on your metabolism but it's also going to keep your neurotransmitters activated as well and increase that because your body is still cold so you need that those neurotransmitters to activate the brown fat as well so that's going to make your brown fat cells more efficient and also your muscle cells more efficient so increase mitochondria in the cells which will then generate heat very fast so if you have done this for a few times so maybe three four five times um being new to this but have tried it a few times you will notice a switch where you like feel that you get easily warmer and you can keep yourself warmer and that is also what we shown in in my study is that the the winter swimmers were physically uh warmer on the skin compared to the control group so they when they are out of the cold when they're out of the cold just relaxing and we tested this in in on the days where they were sleeping in the lab so we could see that they had a a more activation of the brown fat higher temperature so probably because they also loose heat uh they have higher heat loss to the body compared to the control group um because they have a more vascular skin uh because of the contrast of cold and heat so they lose heat faster from the body during that day but is that a bad thing no probably not because that's going to keep your brown fat and your muscles a little bit activated so you will have to it has to work to keep you warm I and I would hypothesize that it also might lead to some of the um subjectively reported improvements in sleep because in order to fall asleep you need your core body temperature to drop by about 1 to 3° yes so it's not just sufficient to be sleeping in a cold room and the blanket you also need your body temperature to drop yes and so what you're um saying if I understand correctly is that by forcing by ending on cold and forcing oneself to heat up naturally um that increases the brown fat storage which I sort of see as a kind of like the oil in the candle yeah of the Furnace that is thermogenesis and that in turn leads to increased heat loss which people might think oh I don't want to lose heat from the body but there are times when you want to lose heat from the body basically it sounds like what we want is to be a very efficient heating and cooling system yes that it's not about being cold or being hot it's really about keeping the system tuned well keeping the oil in the candle this brown fat um functioning yeah what could I ask one question about um fed or fasted is there any rather are there any known benefits of doing deliberate cold exposure and dorsa fasted uh versus um after a a meal say within the last hour or something of that sort I do my deliberate cold exposure first thing in the morning um so in general I'm fasted because I don't eat until a little bit later in the day uh but what's known about that and was that looked at in your study I know you measured glucose but that was as a separate um test away from the cold away from the cold yeah but I also tested glucose on the days on the cold so we measured that as well on on the cooling days um specifically on fasting and fat I don't know uh I don't think that I have seen studies specifically on this okay um more science needed um a number of people ask about the use of deliberate cold exposure to offset some of the symptoms of various diseases now here we're not talking about curing disease we're talking about offsetting symptoms um one question I've seen quite often is whether or not people with rod syndrome this is a syndrome my high school girlfriend had the syndrome and I'll never forget at uh we went at a a school dance together and um this was when we first started dating and um she had rodes which leads to very poor blood flow to the the uh the extremities and um and she was very cold so she left to go to the bathroom and warm up her hands in the warm water and I was left standing there at the dance and people came up to me and asked you know why I was there and who I was there with and I kept telling them who I was with and they didn't believe me cuz they couldn't believe that she would be with me made total sense if you knew me at the time um I was I I was way out of my league with her um at the time I like to think eventually I caught up but in any case um she was in the bathroom for about an hour so at one point I did consider the possibility that she had just left but indeed she hadn't she warmed her hands back up but people with Rod suffer from this um from this thing of very very cold extremities um their fingertips will even turn blue um you know as if they were starting to get frostbitten it's quite dramatic um and that question gets asked whether or not there's any use of cold to try and increase the um elasticity the plasticity of the of the uh small capillaries and vessels by everything you've described um up until now it seems like that would be a logical thing to do um and in addition to that whether or not people with autoimmune conditions people with um any other types of conditions are known to benefit from deliberate cold exposure I'm not aware of any studies but I get asked about this a lot there were a lot of questions about this for you in in the Twitter feed yeah thank you for those questions and I get them as well on social media and I have to say that I I haven't seen any studies directed on this outcome and measuring ruid syndrome um I do know that it's it's a it's not that rare actually a problem and I know that many women or more me women than men uh suffer from this um but logically it would help them if they expose their hands to cold and also heat to make the V it more vascular but and I have heard from people saying that it had helped them but also heard for some others saying it didn't help them so studies are needed on this specific topic I think MH I hurt my hands when I go into the coine I don't have this syndrome at all uh but I keep my hands above the water you do yeah I do that um often I take a little bit of a swim and then of course I to have my hands in the water uh but it helps me when I then get back to the Dy um and then take my hands up because then I can stand there for a little bit and get my one to two minutes exposure uh and then I can go up because then otherwise that would stop me from being in the water enough time that I as long as I I would like to so if people suffer from having this pain in the fingers and it it can be very intense so just take the hands up a bit from the water and uh and that's going to help you also boots neoprene boots it's going to help on the feet some people have the hurt um feel the pain in the feet and or in the ankles and that's going to help them also a little bit okay so there is no problem with keeping hands out or feet in uh nepr booties if people feel the need to do that if that's what the if pain of the hands or feet is a barrier for people doing uh deliberate cold exposure then it seems it would be okay to do uh to keep hands out or to keep your feet in yes because then you you do get the exposure uh but of course hands and feet are very potent uh places in your body to get a fast activation uh of your nervous system of course but if you can just you can also just dip them and then take them off it's going still going to activate that but you have your full body is covered in in the co- receptors you have a full activation anyways so you you were providing very very reassuring information to people because I know a number of people that do not like to put their hands in I find that the more of my body I get in the more comfortable I am psych I don't know if it's psychologically Andor physiologically I find that if where there's an interface between the water and the cold it's most uncomfortable so I prefer to just get everything under I keep my head out although I these days I've been dunking all the way in and then coming out and then dunking once more with my head under before I get out after the the plunge um that raises different question now we're getting into kind of the practicalities of deliberate cold exposure which I think are important um sometimes I'll experience and I hear from a lot of people that they'll get a kind of back of the head headache at the interface of the of the water um you know when they're in doing cold immersion to the neck um okay I assume this has to do with blood flow that there's Vaso constriction right up until the neck and in the region surrounding it but that maybe there's still blood flow to the head but do we know what the origin of these um heada is and again this doesn't happen for everybody but some people do experience them okay yeah I haven't really heard about that one specifically um so but I would say that there are different reasons for maybe keeping your head out of the water but it seems like maybe for some that could be a reason for like just getting like a quick head dunk going all the way in once that's what I've started doing to eliminate I it wasn't getting headaches but I could I noticed that interface and and I wasn't in the rest of the experience it so experience of it so much so I started dunking all the way in I noticed in some of the photos that you've put out and in your book that you'll sometimes wear a cap while you go in yeah okay and well it comes from uh different reasons uh so let's talk about some of the physiological reasons so when you submerge in cold water up to the neck um Studies have shown and this is from Denmark studies from Bia hospital um that when you submerge into cold water up to the neck at Z degrees uh so 0 degrees Celsius very cold um you will have a decreased blood flow to the brain by around 30 to 40% and makes sense because you activate the sympathetic nervous system uh and and therefore you will have a less blood flow to the brain makes you maybe a little bit disser and proof again that you're you need a heart more than a brain because when the sympathetic nervous system gets activated uh blood flow is maintained to the heart to keep you alive but obviously taken away from the brain to keep you from thinking that's why it's hard to think when you're stressed yeah well the muscles and then and your vital organs need to you have to be able to run away from that tiger right the rationale Mak total sense and who am I to disagree with Mother Nature right well but yeah so one of the reasons being that you should keep your head out of the water is that you could increase that uh decrease in blood flow to the brain further if you dun the head so there's this a very nice paper from um from a a research group in Canada where they have collectively looked at different papers where they compared heat loss in a group in the papers where they dunk the head and compared to heat lws uh submerging up to the neck to see how much extra heat do we lose from our core when we dunk the head so and I think it's very interesting that if you submerge up to the neck you have a heat loss of 11% from the body core and when you then uh also d the head you will increase that heat loss rate by 36% so that mean I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not here to say what is right and what is wrong I just think that people should know the information so they can for themselves evaluate what is best for them but if you increase your heat loss rate by 36% from your core that's going to increase your after drop which we touched upon a little bit earlier even further so that's meaning that you you are closer to hypothermia than you are if you just submerge up to the neck so you should really think about whether this is like something that you want to do or if it's just better for you not to get that cold in your core the beanie is also because I have a little bit of sensitive ears so it meaning that if there's wind and because we swim in the open sea in Denmark we have a lot of wind our wind our conditions are just very rainy very windy and when the temperature is also freezing you could get this um what is that called um so very cold and Li headed just from wind so if you also sub merg into cold water and you then get up you could you will get a brain freeze immediately yeah so it is enough to just go up to the neck wear a beanie to just not get dizy also because the the um the heat loss is increased of course but also the blood flow to the brain has decreased so the beanie will keep you a little bit warmer so you can stay for one to two minutes so it's just a way of like getting around some of the conditions also so people can choose that if they they feel that but it's quite normal to do in in Scandinavia where aini I love it and um so for those of you afraid of doing a two-minute cold shower what uh Dr Silber just described uh let's uh you see how um she and others are capable of doing things far harder than that um when the way you describe it with the cold wind and Scandinavia and uh um is is quite striking it along the lines of covering the head um there's this um seemingly paradoxical uh thing of people going into hot saunas and wearing wool caps you know if you go to a or you I go to uh auna and there are people who are um well from Eastern Europe or typically or Finland or um Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere what you'll see is that many of them are wearing wool caps in the sauna which many people think is to make it hotter that's actually not the case it actually insulates you from the heat environment the urg the sense of urgency to get out of the hot sauna is a braind driven mechanism and so um the reason that people wear wool hats in the sauna is it actually lets you stay in the sauna longer um because it takes a lot of heat to the skin before you feel that you you have quote unquote have to get out whereas so when you insulate the brain um you don't get that signal um it's pretty interesting I've tried this before just by putting a towel over my head in the sauna and you can stay in there you much more easily and for for much longer you know as we talk about these different stimuli for um the hormetic response the adaptation to stress you know it occurs to me that the the big ones in our evolutionary history have been light right I mean you were talking about seasonal changes um we know there especially as you go up to Nordic countries there are seasonal changes in the amount of Light by time of year atic ones in fact less so at the equator of course um light temperature food movement and it it's sort of interesting and and at the same time perhaps it should have been obvious to us that there are stimy that our bodies have evolved to adapt to in very powerful ways and so the idea that temperature heat and cold could evoke these tremendous physiological changes that are beneficial for us probably shouldn't surprise us at all I mean I mean this is why we I mean these are not um ESO esoteric mechanisms they're actually the the foundational mechanisms by which our our body and the bodies of other animals adapt um so I do have a question about the uh different ways that people could approach deliberate cold exposure so for instance um children uh I've been to Bas where there are kids you know six or seven years old with their parents at the B um and so they're in hot sauna I'm not suggesting people do this if they're if they're not you know adapted to it and you know talk to your parents kids and talk to your kids's parents um talk to your doctors um but is remarkable I mean uh children doing sauna from a young age or deliberate cold exposure are there any data on this and is it safe assuming that you know obviously that they can swim and or they're doing this in a in a tub or shower um and then I'd also like to ask you about are there any additional male female differences I know you're study focused um on men but um other Studies have focused on both and you of course um are a woman and can attest to your own experience with this um so children men women um differences there in terms of protocols is there anything that people should build into the structure of of their deliberate cold exposure that's unique to that uh so yeah so this was on cold exposure so um yeah I think that um starting with the the question about children um I think that it's important to to think about as children are smaller than adults so we cannot really completely transfer all the information and the benefits and also protocols for how long and and and stuff like that to children we cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass and one study that actually um proves this is a study where they have compared heat loss uh in um children boys who were 12 years old uh compared to um adults um men and looked at the heat loss of the core temperature and exposed them to a one or one or two minutes um cold exposure or immersion up to the neck and what they saw was that the the the boys in this study could actually defend the core temperature in same way as the adults could but they had to use their muscles way faster so it means that they couldn't stay for as long uh and they use more energy to defend their core temperature compared to the to the adults but for one minute it seems that they could actually comp but they will be colder when they then come out because they are smaller in their Mass to their Rao right so it means that if the surface is so large on children and their mass and muscles being smaller to that ratio it means that they can be in the water uh less time before they get hypothermic so just think about that they are just smaller they can't defend their temperature for a very long time but in this study they saw that for up to I think it it was a minute or so they could minute one minute yeah I'm glad you mentioned hypothermia and smaller bodied um people children uh I used to do some um Pacific uh ocean swims in the morning um without wet suits and I adapted to it pretty quickly and these are fairly long swim and we brought an excellent swimmer with us um a that was interning with me for a while um is 16 years old at the time and um very lean and um he wasn't small for his age but he was smaller than us than the it was all guys on the swim that day Sometimes women join us um and he got hypothermic um and he's an excellent swimmer and he didn't report feeling overly cold but um fortunately we got him to Shore and heated him up again um so he lived I don't think his mother's going to ever let him go swimming with us again he's thriving in the world he's a university student now um and he recalls that swim I mean this is why you always want to Ocean swim with a buddy with people um yeah he he became hypothermic his teeth turned yellow he was kind slurring his words he wasn't making sense you know we got him on the shore and he was kind of you know drooling and a little bit semi euphoric and then kind of you know it was um hypothermia is no joke so I think yeah so I I I'm really glad that this is coming up because the cold is a powerful stimulus and um and I and kids are at a and smaller bodied people are at at greater risk of hypothermia so a good reason to approach it with caution maybe start with cold showers get uh then cold immersion and still water natural water and open bodies of water of course are always going to be um more dangerous for other reasons currents and things of that sort exactly okay I'm drowning yeah so important note there um what about any additional male female differences or similarities that um we should be aware of and this comes up all the time on social media anytime I post anything about a study it's what about women because oftentimes there are differences um yeah yeah and and and there are we we also just talked about the difference in in in temperature in men and women so it means that if we did if we replicated my study in women it could be that they would have enough you can say cold exposure with just 9 minutes per week it could be because they H apparently are also just colder and uh and they have increased metabolism in their Brown fat it's just they have more Brown fat it could be but this is just something that I I I I frankly don't know but women also do cold exposure winter swimming with the 11 minutes protocol I do it myself and feel uh good about it so I would say that um women Also regarding activation of the brown fed it should be the same um in theory but I don't know if women actually do need to have another protocol when it comes to this rapid cold exposure I think that it's another question if we are talking about ice swimming when it comes to how far can you be in the cold water without getting hypothermic then there will be differences in men and and and female but but if you do this cold exposure for a very brief amount of time which is what I try to to talk to about talk about the what we call also micr stressing the body to to increase the htic stress the healthy stress then this is such a short amount of um exposure that it it's fairly the same I think I think women can look at this as a fairly good protocol for for for them as well I always say that if you really dread the cold and um and don't like the cold then you are a perfect candidate for using deliberate cold exposure because the sympathetic itic aka the stress response will be greater and thereby the adaptation to that shorter one or two minutes is um is going to be much greater right for people that are perfectly comfortable in the cold it's harder to get a an adaptation response the same way that if somebody's very strong and they can lift a very heavy weight that that very heavy weight is unlikely to evoke the same kind of or same degree of of uh adaptive responses if somebody is not quite as strong so another reason to keep these exposures relatively short and more frequent than to do longer duration exposures frequently however let's say somebody only had two days a week um to do deliberate cold exposure maybe they don't have access to a sauna maybe they do would you suggest that they get in for one or two minutes then get out then get back in for another couple of minutes then get out and call that for you know four or five minutes um to try and get to that 11 minutes total per week um as opposed to getting in for a full 5 minutes um and then getting out and coming back a second time that week I know this is getting down into the weeds but these are the sorts of things that I think people really want to know because not a lot of people either don't live close to a body of water or don't have a cold plunge um that they can do this with although cold shower apparently works too so most people live close to a shower yeah as so definitely I think the the changes in temperature is what is strengthening your your cells in the body so if you can do the short amount of uh exposure and then get out and get back in that is going to you can say um um strengthen your cells because you are challenging them to to adapt to um changing temp temperatures so during one session you can change this right you you can do it if you are able to go to cold water but also a SAA then you just do it that automatically you will have a change in temperature but you could also do it where variating the temperature in your Co plune if you have if you have a plunge or if you have the Open Sea or you have seasoning Seasons even you have we have that in Denmark so we have four seasons and the temperature is going to vary with that so we have nature who can just change this for us and we don't have to think about it if you have a cold plunge well then I would say that changing the temperature is what is going to create this romatic stress and also keep your cells on its toes you can say because you are try the body will still be um stressed to try to adapt to the new temperature as it's seen as something actually toxic to the body right it's a small small piece of toxicity that you are exposing yourself to you don't have to swallow it but it's enough that you touch it actually yeah great uh great way to frame it um that brings me back to this idea of circadian time in your study you didn't um control for specific time of day and now I'm realizing that may be a great asset to the whole thing so we know for instance that our bodies go through pretty dramatic shifts in temperature from the time we wake up um our body starts heating up as we wake up and um continues to heat until the afternoon and then starts to drop in the later afternoon and then assuming all things are working correctly um that body temperature drops and we sleep so I could imagine that doing deliberate cold exposure at different times um just by way of convenience or by way of intention could be very beneficial because my body temp is going to be quite a bit warmer at one time of day versus another and in that way keeping the system tuned and that's really what I keep hearing coming through in as you explain these data and all these um beautiful studies yours and others is that it's not really about getting cold it's about going from warm to cold and from cold to warm it's not it and I love this idea because I probably said this a hundred times on my podcast and a million times in my life and I'll continue to which is that biology is not an event it's a process like these these um metabolic and Thermo regulatory processes are indeed like the Turning of a knob it's a verb yeah it's as opposed to a noun and I and so I I think if people can internalize that idea that they're going to um have a lot more flexibility a lot more fun and and get a lot more benefit as opposed to thinking okay I need to get into X degrees of water for x amount of time on X number of days you know in a very R way all the time much and how cold and and I mean it's it's just like well because we also don't have studies showing exactly if you just keep five degrees in your water and you do that for a month then what happens we maybe in the future we will know much more about this and I'm I'm sure it's going to come and I really hope so but I just think by logically changing that temperature up and down up and down and you also do that in your water it doesn't really it's not that important what temperature you you will have your water then then just keep changing it going up and down it could be all up to 12° C you're going to activate your brown fat anyways I mean 12 uh 19° a cold air is enough to activate your brown Foods so maybe we don't have to go as cold as I think many people think um and putting ice even all the time you don't have to it's not I don't think it's necessary to to expose yourself to that cold uh temperature all the time um but vary it a bit so keep the system off balance and the way to keep it tuned you mentioned a study that is more recent or ongoing that's not published um if you're willing um could you share maybe some of the uh data from that or findings from that study um with of course the the cue to everybody that these are not yet published data so that the conclusions could change the data could change for that matter yeah so we we haven't analyzed all the data yet and I I know from the study that we did publish that we we would need to look more at the data so I don't really have any results yet that I can share because we are still in very preliminary analysis of this so I I wouldn't know yet what to exactly say about it but what we looked at was both men and women we so that's that's coming oh that's fantastic I um that answer is going to please a great number of people and and Intrigue everybody so well listen I I want to really thank you for coming here today to talk about your work um and the incredible direction that it points to because I think that um you know no one study is definitive but your study really again stands as a landmark in the landscape of exploring deliberate cold exposure and heat how it can impact and potentially impact our health because frankly there just haven't been that many um highresolution uh detailed modern studies of this there have been studies of sauna there have been some studies of cold there are a lot of groups in physiology that work on um hypothermia and very cold exposure but um most of the temperatures used in those studies just aren't practical so first of all I just want to thank you for doing the work that you've done and for the work that you continue to do I'm um uh waiting with baited breath as they say to um uh to hear the results of this uh study that's ongoing on both men and women so um we'll have to have you back to to inform us about that soon and I want to thank you for um the incredible public education efforts that you've been doing on social media um and with respect to your book um and we of course we'll put links to all of those things in the show note caption so people can learn from you and can continue to learn from you we we certainly need more scientists who are both experienced with doing hardcore research as it's called and who also do the practices I think that's a wonderful additional asset you know you're not just behind a lab Cod or bundled up in a in a down uh in a down feather jacket as everyone else is getting in the cold you do these things and that you are so open and generous in the way that you share uh knowledge which includes coming here today to to share knowledge with me and uh our audience so thank you ever so much you're very welcome I am so pleased to be here and thank you so much for inviting me and I could explain my study and I could share some of my insights from from doing that so I'm very grateful for being here delighted and we'll have to have you back again thank you for joining me for today's discussion all about
